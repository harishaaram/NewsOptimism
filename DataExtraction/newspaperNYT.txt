----TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE---
In the charcoal fields of San Pedro, a bustling port city in the southwest Ivory Coast, hundreds of women and children — some barely school-age — toil day and night among heaps moldering wood, waste water and air thick with smoke. Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.



As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedro’s largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, the nation’s capital, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.



Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro. The aim is to finance a drinking water system, to build a safe recreation room for the women and children and to help the young girls get an education.

“Elections are not only about numbers,” Justice Mwilu said. “Elections should be like a math test where you only get points for the answer if you show your workings.”

She also criticized the electoral commission for refusing to comply with court orders to open its computer servers, saying its refusal gave credence to opposition claims that the vote had been manipulated.

“This contemptuous disobedience with the court order leaves us with no option but to accept the petitioner’s claims that the I.T. system was infiltrated and the data therein interfered with,” she said. “Or officials themselves interfered with the data or simply refused to accept that it had bungled the transmission system and were unable to verify the data.”

The election controversy hinged on two paper forms used to legally validate the ballots — one from 40,883 polling stations and the other from 290 constituencies.

Representatives from rival parties were required to approve the forms before they were scanned and electronically transmitted to a national tallying center in Nairobi, where they were to be put online immediately so that they could be crosschecked.

But the electronic system, which had been overseen by an election official, who was killed on the eve of the vote, broke down. Therefore, only the results, and not the forms, were sent to the tallying center, often by text message.

The official results were based on the electronic tally, which was vulnerable to error, before the paper results were fully collated, the judges found.

In its findings earlier this month, the court also ruled that hundreds of polling stations had failed to send any presidential results; that some forms lacked security features like water marks, signatures or serial numbers; and that some unauthorized users had tried to access the voting system.

International election observers — including John Kerry, the former United States secretary of state — were quick to praise the electoral body immediately after the vote, saying there was no evidence of vote tampering at polling stations and that the paper forms would show clearly who had won. The observers had assumed that the forms would be easily verifiable and would be matched with figures texted to the tallying center by party officials.

Kenya has been mired in political uncertainty since the election, and there are renewed fears of violence, even though the vote took place peacefully and there were far fewer deaths in its aftermath compared with previous polls.

The opposition leader Mr. Odinga has said he will refuse to participate in a new election unless electoral commission members are prosecuted and “legal and constitutional guarantees” are put in place to ensure a free and transparent vote.

This week, American and European observers cautioned political leaders and Kenyans against inciting violence as the country heads for a new election.

“Now is the time to focus on preparing for the new poll, which, in line with the court’s order and the Constitution, must be run by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and be held by the end of October,” the observers said.

Whether the new vote can be carried out by Oct. 17, as the court requested, is unclear. The French digital security company that supplied the voting technology says it has been treated unfairly and that the machinery probably will not be ready by that date.

The Sept. 1 ruling to nullify the election results came as a surprise, and has been seen as a milestone for the rule of law and for judicial independence on a continent where democratic norms are still in flux. A disputed presidential election a decade ago led to deadly violence, but this year’s voting was mostly peaceful.

Even so, the Kenyan judiciary said that judges and staff members had faced attacks and threats since the ruling and that the police had failed to adequately protect them.

“These attacks are denigrating, demeaning and degrading and are meant to intimidate, threaten and cow the institution and individual judges,” Chief Justice David K. Maraga said in a statement.

On Wednesday, security forces tear-gassed protesters who had gathered to demonstrate in front of the Supreme Court, and nearby roads had been blocked ahead of the much anticipated but contentious hearing.

Mai Hassan, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, called the developments “truly exciting.”

“The Supreme Court criticized the electoral commission’s handling of the election, and the lack of faith that it instilled in the citizenry, as opposed to flat-out arguing that the overall outcome — whether Uhuru ‘won’ — was in doubt,” she said. “In that way, this is a great step for Kenya. The judiciary is showing its might against the once all-powerful executive.”

She added that she expected Mr. Kenyatta, one of the richest men in Africa, to win a revote, but cautioned that she worried about the possibility of election-related violence.

“Now that there is another vote, I’m worried that Raila will rile up his supporters and Uhuru will respond with force,” she said. “Raila used a lot of war rhetoric in the run-up to the August vote, and Uhuru retaliated by being very clear that his government would not tolerate unrest.”

MEXICO CITY — Gustavo López recognized the boy’s clothes first.

His tiny frame, pulled from the wreckage, lay over the jagged pieces of what remained of the school. It was his 7-year-old son.

He sat in shock for hours, quietly trying to maintain strength for his 9-year-old daughter, who had escaped the school unharmed. He wondered how to tell her that her younger brother, also named Gustavo, was dead — one of at least 30 children who perished at the Enrique Rebsámen school after it collapsed in the earthquake that devastated Mexico on Tuesday, killing more than 200 people.

Mr. López waited there for his cousin, Mauricio, who loved the boy and often took him on bike rides and to the movies. By the time Mauricio arrived a few hours later, hundreds of medical personnel, rescuers, volunteers and families were racing around, trying to unearth students still buried in the rubble.

“He was my son, too,” Mauricio screamed when he heard the news, collapsing onto the upturned earth as Mr. López tried to console him. “I can’t bear this; I can’t!”

Such screams of anguish rose above the clamor at the school overnight, markers of loss in the chaotic crowd. Parents climbed trees and playground equipment to get a better vantage of the rescue effort, clinging to the hope that their children would emerge unscathed.

Many did, having rushed out before tumbling walls could trap them. Passers-by had also raced to the school immediately after the quake to pluck students from the cavities and openings of the buckled structure.

But as the day and night wore on, mostly lifeless bodies were pulled from the wreckage, their names recorded by an army of volunteers keeping lists of the dead. By Wednesday night, five people were known to be still missing, including one student who officials said was alive but trapped as rescuers tried frantically to reach her. Hope was dwindling that any more children would be found alive.

“To see a parent carry their own dead baby is something I will never forget,” said Elena Villaseñor, a volunteer whose own home was badly damaged. She held a sheaf of papers with the names of children on them, written large enough for parents to see them from a distance.

Her own daughter was safe, she said, having been at a different school that did not collapse. But she could not sit idle while others suffered, and so she raced to this school to help however she could.

The death toll across the country — in Morelos, Mexico State, Puebla and Mexico City — climbed to 217 people less than 24 hours after the earthquake struck. The number is expected to rise even higher, as the rescue efforts slowly transition into recovery efforts, and more of the missing are marked as dead.

Watching that number climb, hour by hour across the city and the broader earthquake zone, is a nation already in mourning. Two weeks earlier, the largest earthquake in a century hit Mexico, killing at least 90 people in the south of the country and offering a grim foreshadowing of the hardship still to come from this one.

Perhaps nowhere was the suffering more concentrated than at the collapsed school. The smell of gas, sweat and earth filled the air overnight as people yelled their messages into megaphones. At first, the lights from police cars and emergency vehicles lit the rescue. Later, a generator was brought to the scene to power floodlights.

Of the 400 students who attend the school, it was unclear exactly how many were there when the earthquake struck on Tuesday afternoon and made it out of the building. The injured, more than 60 of them, were sent to area hospitals, while traumatized parents whisked others to safety.

At least three parents at the site of Enrique Rebsámen, a Mexico City private school, had been communicating with their children trapped inside. They managed to reach them through the messaging service WhatsApp, begging their children to give them details, like how far from the main door they were when the building collapsed, to help the search efforts.

One of the many volunteers, seated at a makeshift desk on Tuesday night, helped keep a list of the injured and the dead; it included at least five adults. Residents donned red vests and formed human chains to remove the chunks of concrete from the school’s broken edifice. Giant piles of water, medicine, blankets and even baby formula hugged the periphery, brought by neighbors who carted it in by the armful.

The solidarity in the aftermath of the quake has been repeated at collapsed buildings across Mexico, a quiet but resolute determination to help. Strangers spending hours clearing debris, medics and construction workers plunging into the bowels of broken buildings, students and even children bringing water and food.

At the school, the blitz of activity continued all night and into morning. Someone yelled for medicine: “We need clonazepam, insulin, anesthetics, antihistamines and oxygen tanks.” Workers wore helmets and face masks. Bulldozers and excavation machines went in and out of the disaster site.

Everyone found something to do, passing water, coffee or medicine to those who needed it. Volunteers called for baby bottles to feed the children still trapped in the wreckage.

Every so often, amid the piercing noise of raised voices, grumbling machinery and the whine of ambulances, a volunteer’s arm would rise and others would follow. An odd silence would settle over the gathered.

A name would be called.

“Sara Ledesma! Where are her parents?” a paramedic screamed. No one appeared, and the masses voiced her name in somber chorus.

Her parents were nowhere to be found.

In the frantic confusion of the rescue operation, the crosscurrents of hundreds of well-meaning personnel sometimes led to frightening miscommunication.

After toiling for hours sifting through the rubble, Florentino Rodríguez García was given a sudden ray of hope: His 9-year-old grandson, José Eduardo Huerta Rodríguez, was supposedly fine.

A medic told him that the boy had been taken to a hospital for injuries. But after hours of hunting, Mr. Rodríguez could find no trace of the boy.

He headed back to the school and was approached by a nurse this time. She took him by the hand. She told him the medic had been mistaken. José, she said, was still trapped inside.

“Please don’t tell me that,” Mr. Rodríguez screamed, collapsing into hysterics. “They told me he was out! This can’t be true!”

“We just celebrated his birthday this past Sunday,” he told the woman, who listened quietly. “He is such a smart little boy!”

He melted back into the crowd of anguished parents congregated outside of the school — and waited.

And then, an hour later, an arm was raised, followed by others. Silence.

“José Eduardo Huerta Rodríguez,” the crowd began to chant.

The boy had been pulled out. He was still alive, a rescue worker said.

But several hours later, a family member emailed to say that in the chaos, the rescuer had been mistaken. José Eduardo, the relative said, had died before his body was recovered.

For instance, median household income is much higher in New Hampshire than in Arkansas; heart disease and obesity are much bigger problems in Mississippi than in Colorado; the opioid epidemic is much worse in West Virginia than in Nebraska. Relatively sparsely populated areas struggle with the closings of rural hospitals, leaving large geographic areas underserved, while urban areas have a high concentration of large hospitals, many of which struggle with overcrowding.

Some states have both major cities and vast rural areas. Some skew younger while others skew older. State-specific factors help explain why even under the centralized Obamacare, premium increases and the participation of insurers have varied widely across the country. It makes sense to allow states to set their priorities and direct their resources based on the characteristics of their populations.

As states come up with innovative solutions to their health care problems, it means there are 50 opportunities to experiment. States can test solutions that worked elsewhere, or steer clear of ideas that failed. This path makes more sense than having politicians and distant regulators impose one giant experiment on the entire nation that is harder to undo if it fails.

The idea of turning more power over to the states has long been advocated by conservatives, but there are compelling reasons for liberals to get behind devolving power from the federal government.

When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it left many of the details to the discretion of the Department of Health and Human Services, giving vast powers to the secretary to determine everything from fast-food menu labeling requirements to when individuals could purchase insurance. During the Obama years, the administration used its regulatory discretion — pushing and arguably exceeding the limits of the law — to prop up the president’s signature legislative accomplishment as the program ran into implementation problems.

When President Trump took office, he appointed Tom Price, a longtime foe of Obamacare during his time in Congress, to run H.H.S. In the past several months, liberals have shouted “sabotage” as they have witnessed Mr. Price take actions such as slashing Obamacare’s advertising budget, tweaking the rules on the types of plans insurers are allowed to offer and cutting in half — to six weeks — the program’s open enrollment period. Mr. Trump himself has created uncertainty over whether he will continue to authorize payments to insurers that congressional Republicans sued Mr. Obama over.

Any national health care system that assumes one party will control Washington for all eternity is doomed to fail. New Yorkers would have much less to fear about a Trump presidency if the president didn’t control agencies that set policies for the entire country.

From the perspective of somebody who wants to see genuine federalism in health care, Graham-Cassidy leaves a lot to be desired. Because it keeps many of Obamacare’s regulations on the books at the national level, it limits the amount of innovation that can occur at the state level. The fact that it keeps most of Obamacare’s taxes means that states preferring to take a more free market approach will still be paying for a big government footprint in other states. Under one scenario, for instance, Texans could be subsidizing single-payer health care in Vermont.

The company has a diverse range of listings in the London area, chosen from the best-reviewed properties on more than 25 different rental sites, including Airbnb and Onefinestay. Options include a houseboat in Hackney, a loft in Islington, an apartment in Chelsea and a townhouse in Notting Hill. Nightly rates are between 98 and 4,000 pounds, but the average price is 200 pounds per bedroom per night; the average three-bedroom home, for example, is 600 pounds a night. Mr. Meyassed describes the brand as “affordable luxury.”

My Home

I needed a home spacious enough to accommodate my husband and me, as well as our two young children. We were keen on a central location close to popular attractions and the Tube, and wanted an upscale property that was reasonably priced. I found several dozen options matching our needs and chose the Pembrokes, a four-level townhouse with three bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms in the chic Kensington neighborhood. The home had a spacious kitchen with a lovely dining room, a small and leafy green backyard, a living room with a reading nook and three airy bedrooms — two on the top floor and a master suite on the third floor. We were on a picturesque residential block, a stone’s throw from a pub and several cafes; Kensington Palace and High Street Kensington, lined with restaurants and shops, were a 10-minute walk away, and two Tube stations were within a 15-minute walk. The property rents for around 810 pounds a night.

The Stay

The Plum Guide operates on a host model: Once guests book their accommodations, the company puts them in touch with their host, who either owns or manages that property. Although the company’s in-house concierge is available to help renters with any needs, the host is their primary point of contact in advance of and throughout their stay.

Our host, who manages several properties in London for their owners, offered to arrange our airport transfers and also asked if we wanted housekeeping during our stay and the kitchen stocked with any groceries before we arrived; these services are an additional fee, but are available to anyone who rents with the Plum Guide.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted by our convivial host, a spotless home and a refrigerator full of the essentials we had requested. After a quick tour of the home and a briefing about the neighborhood, our host emphasized that we could call or text him with anything in regard to the rental. Then he left us to ourselves.

As it turned out, our need to contact him came later that evening when we realized that we had no hot water. Our host called a plumber who declared that the home’s boiler was broken; it was a weekend, and replacing it would take another day.

With the prospect of no hot shower for almost two days, my instinct was to flee, but we didn’t. We loved the home and appreciated the Plum Guide’s gracious response to the situation, offering us alternative accommodations either at another property or at an upscale hotel. The hot water was restored the next day, and we ended up immensely enjoying our time at the Pembrokes.

The Bottom Line

In an increasingly crowded market of vacation home rental companies, the Plum Guide stands out for its selective list of properties and high standards of service. The swift response to rectify the glitch with the broken boiler is a prime example of the latter. On another trip to London, I would most certainly use the company again.

Visually, they have a similar aesthetic: white men with dark hair cut short and often pointed skyward. (A halfhearted beard is optional.) More often than not, they have sturdy, approachable, single-syllable last names: Thomas Rhett, Brett Young, Chris Lane, Michael Ray.

They are the men next door, promising undying affection and emotional stability — a cliché, perhaps, but one more appealing than the last. This surge also doubles as a response to the gender crisis that has been gripping country music the last few years, as captured in two parallel phenomena: the rise of the bro, and the disappearance of the female star.

For most of this decade, the genre’s male stars have been strutters: egocentric, bumblingly flirtatious, a little dunce-y. At the same time, female singers have been getting squeezed ever more tightly. In 2015, a radio consultant referred to them as “the tomatoes of our salad” — the men were the lettuce — sparking controversy. Established stars got pushed to the fringes, and younger artists like Maddie & Tae and Kelsea Ballerini found success by positioning themselves in opposition to prevailing masculine narratives.

These are systematic issues — to fix them would require coordinated response from record labels, publishing companies, radio and video outlets, and more. But the rise of the gentleman — the gentlebro? — is a reluctant, #NotAllMen solution. It dilutes the toxic levels of masculinity in the genre without offering women songs of their own to sing, instead plying them with ones that place them on a pedestal.

Michael Ray released his debut in 2015 but didn’t get much traction until late last year, when its slow-burning come-on “Think a Little Less” began its climb to country radio ubiquity. For the country gentlemen, the song is slightly on the sexual side — most of their proclamations of love prioritize the heart, not the flesh — but he sings it with restraint and dignity: “In case you were wondering, you’ve never looked hotter/So why even bother looking at the reasons not to?/Maybe we ought to.”

Chris Lane’s hair is frozen into a wheat field on the cover of his self-titled 2016 debut, which is full of courtly proclamations of dedication, including a cover of Mario’s sweet R&B plea “Let Me Love You.” His signature song is the genteel ballad “For Her,” an almost Disney-saccharine tribute to a woman: “She’s got a smile that makes your worst day feel like it’s your birthday/She’s got a laugh like confetti/Would change her name if she’d let me.”

There are several more of this sort — Ryan Follese’s “Put a Label On It,” Jon Langston’s “Right Girl Wrong Time,” Russell Dickerson’s “Yours,” Devin Dawson’s “I Don’t Care Who Sees,” LANCO’s “Greatest Love Story,” Dylan Scott’s “My Girl.” They rack up YouTube plays and, at their most successful, choke up the Billboard country charts, particularly the one that tracks airplay. These songs seem to overindex at country radio, which appears to have made little effort to remedy the gender imbalance that led to the “tomato” fiasco.

In many cases, these feel like copycats. But Brett Young has established himself as gentleman country’s heir apparent. He went to No. 2 on the Billboard country chart this year with “In Case You Didn’t Know,” a wedding anthem in the making, and one of this year’s most impressive pop songs (even if it shares DNA with Chicago’s resentful ballad “Look Away”). Mr. Young has a scratchy voice, but he bolsters it with tons of melodic ballast, turning a song that’s desperate at its core into something majestic:

In case you didn’t know

Baby I’m crazy ’bout you

And I would be lying if I said

That I could live this life without you

Even though I don’t tell you all the time

You had my heart a long long time ago

In case you didn’t know

“In Case You Didn’t Know” comes from Mr. Young’s soothing, approachable self-titled debut album, which was released in February. His true specialty may be the other side of being a gentleman: taking a romantic loss on the chin, and accepting that you weren’t worthy. Some of his most impressive songs are tragedies. “Memory Won’t Let Me” feigns optimism with its jaunty guitar and sweet harmonies, but they’re merely sugarcoating lyrics about being unable to move on.

He’s most potent on “You Ain’t Here to Kiss Me,” on which he suffers through a long flight, alone: “Five-dollar drink and a lonely window seat/Half-empty plane on New Year’s Eve/Lovebirds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy.”

This is the emo side of the gentleman, looking inward for shortcomings, not outward. In the bro era, women were objects to be chased. In these songs, they’re porcelain, gleaming and precious.

Adam Craig’s excellent “Just a Phase,” from his self-titled debut EP last year, extends that theme to a relationship that hasn’t even ended yet. “I’m a Friday night, you’re a Sunday afternoon/I’m a reckless rock ’n’ roll, and you’re a last slow dance to a midnight tune/Deep in your heart, I know you know I ain’t right for you.” A gentleman knows when he’s out of his league, and recedes without resentment.

Most strikingly, the recent good-guy flood has given established singers with checkered thematic pasts a vibrant framework to shoehorn themselves into. Blake Shelton’s last two singles have been a heartbreak ballad, “Every Time I Hear That Song,” and a promise of forever-after, “I’ll Name the Dogs.” Former bro Kip Moore’s “More Girls Like You” is about how the right woman can turn even a vagabond into a gentleman. Brett Eldredge, a centrist balladeer with barely any hint of rural accent or interest, who just released his fourth album, has been waiting for a moment like this since his emergence at the beginning of the decade — his 2016 single, “Wanna Be That Song,” which went to No. 3 on the Billboard country chart, is an ur-gentleman ballad.

Not everything that appears gentlemanly is, though. For the last 31 weeks, Sam Hunt’s “Body Like a Back Road” has topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, a record run. Mr. Hunt straddles the line between the previous generation and the current one — he is hip-hop-minded, but also traditional, and exceedingly sensitive above all, both to his partner’s needs and to his own emotional failings. “Body Like a Back Road” is a gentlemanly kind of sensual, but Mr. Hunt is too nimble a songwriter, too progressive a stylist and, most crucially, too much of an overt flirt to neatly fall into this category. He does have one genuine gentleman anthem, though: “I Met A Girl,” written in part by Mr. Hunt and recorded by the George Strait doppelganger William Michael Morgan, which went Top 10 on the country chart last year.

That leaves the throne open for Mr. Rhett, whose second album, “Life Changes” — on which he gives these themes almost his full attention — opened at the top of the Billboard chart this week. “Sweetheart” is a doo-wop song about devotion: “You’re my life, you’re my dream/You’re the reason for every song I sing.” The lead single, “Craving You,” a pop-soul duet with Maren Morris, is on the edgier side of good behavior.

But the real awakening on this album — as striking as “Die a Happy Man” was on his debut — is the title track, a cheerful Randy Newman-esque autobiographical jaunt. He sings about his unexpected career, proposing to his wife young, how she is now verified on Instagram, and how they adopted a child from Uganda, and then had another child of their own. Throughout, Mr. Rhett amiably shrugs over the thin line between the things he can and can’t control. A true gentleman rolls with the punches.

“When are the Wegos coming on?” the young boy sitting next to me asked his father. His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were, five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan, a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks.

Soon enough, the Wegos awwived, and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway, a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion, winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there, and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity.

This is especially disappointing given the conceptual wit, visual flair and bonkers imagination of “The Lego Movie” and the sweet silliness of “The Lego Batman Movie.” “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” directed by Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher and Bob Logan from a script with an army of credited authors, attaches itself to some of the tropes and images of Asian action cinema with sloppy affection. Mr. Chan, who voices a wise and venerable teacher in addition to playing the wise and venerable shopkeeper, doesn’t really belong to the ninja genre. But neither do the young fighters who protect the city of Ninjago from an evil four-armed warlord named Garmadon, voiced by Justin Theroux. They prefer big, noisy machines to stealth, guile and swordsmanship.

Garmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun?

Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor; their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired, cynical, sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery.

A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs, freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation, and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies.

We’re also, at least in the eyes of the committee that issued this strategy memo disguised as a movie, eager to hear the voices of cool people we watch on television. Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City,” Fred Armisen of “Portlandia” and Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley” (and also “The Big Sick”) are on sidekick duty here, to no memorable effect. Ms. Jacobson’s character, the only girl in the six-ninja squad, barely rises to the level of tokenism.
