A police officer in Northern New Jersey came to the rescue of a woman who lost her diamond engagement ring Sunday while changing a flat tire on the side of a busy highway.

Police in Paramus, located just outside New York City, said in a Facebook post that Kimberly Garcia realized when she got home on Sunday that she had lost her ring on Route 4 after pulling over to change the tire.

"When she returned home she realized that her ring was missing and called our department to file a report," police said.

Garcia went back to the stretch of highway with police later that day, but was unable to find the ring.

On Monday, Paramus police said, Officer Jon Henderson went back to look for it during his free patrol time and found the ring.

----SUMMARY ARTICLE---
French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged Wednesday the Iran nuclear deal is not enough to contain the Islamic Republic's nuke and missile ambitions, however, he maintained scrapping the deal altogether would be a mistake.
No,” Macron told reporters in New York, where he was for the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump has called the Iran nuclear deal “the worst ever," and during the presidential campaign he often threatened to tear it up.
“I proposed that we initiate the work of a contact group at P5 level [Britain, China, Germany, France, Russia], which has been done, and we will widen it to represent the political forces in Syria and the regional powers without Iran,” Macron said.

French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged Wednesday the Iran nuclear deal is not enough to contain the Islamic Republic's nuke and missile ambitions, however, he maintained scrapping the deal altogether would be a mistake.

Macron, whose country had been one of the toughest negotiators during talks between Britain, China, Germany, Russia, the United States and Iran, said Tehran’s increased influence in the Middle East and signs of ballistic missile testing showed the accord was not enough to deter the country.

“Is this agreement enough? No,” Macron told reporters in New York, where he was for the United Nations General Assembly. “It is not, given the evolution of the regional situation and increasing pressure that Iran is exerting on the region, and given increased activity by Iran on the ballistic level since the accord.”

The French leader offered to mediate talks between the U.S. and Iran, saying he has not given up on trying to convince President Trump to abide by the deal, Reuters reported.

Trump has called the Iran nuclear deal “the worst ever," and during the presidential campaign he often threatened to tear it up. However, since taking office, his administration has reluctantly continued to certify the agreement.

Macron said he believed he had managed to at least convince Trump to allow France and the United Nations to mediate between Tehran and Washington with regard to the situation in Syria, where Iran is a core backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

“Let’s be honest, the tensions are on the rise. Look at the activities of Hezbollah and Iran’s pressure on Syria,” he said. “We need a clear framework to be able to reassure regional countries and the United States.”

Macron said he wants to discuss possible sanctions over Iran’s ballistic missile program, open negotiations on what happens after the limitations agreed to in the accord begin to be lifted in 2025 and hold discussions on the role of Iran in the region.

“I proposed that we initiate the work of a contact group at P5 level [Britain, China, Germany, France, Russia], which has been done, and we will widen it to represent the political forces in Syria and the regional powers without Iran,” Macron said. “The United Nations Secretary General and France will play the role of mediator for Iran so that we have a parallel negotiation, but that will enable us to include Iran in the process."

The pilot of a helicopter carrying country music singer Troy Gentry reported the aircraft was experiencing mechanical problems shortly before it crashed in New Jersey, killing the two men, according to authorities.

Radio communication between emergency responders show the pilot was planning to make an emergency landing and was hovering in the air while waiting for the fire department to arrive. But the responders note seconds later the helicopter had crashed just south of the airport.

The fatal helicopter ride turned out to be a "spur of the moment" trip for Gentry who is best known as part of the country music duo Montgomery Gentry.

The 50-year-old died after the helicopter crashed in New Jersey. He was scheduled to perform alongside Eddie Montgomery at the Flying W Airport and Resort in Medford Friday evening. The show was immediately cancelled.

Brian Rayner, senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, told People Magazine Monday Gentry’s helicopter ride in a Schweizer 269 Charlie I aircraft is being preliminary described as “impromptu, spur of the moment.”

TROY GENTRY DEAD — CELEBRITIES REACT

“[It was a] ‘Would you like to go for a helicopter ride?’” described Rayner. “Not long after takeoff, the pilot announced over the airport frequency — which was being monitored by a number of people — that he was having difficulty controlling engine RPM. A couple of different responses to that challenge were discussed, and he was performing an auto rotational descent to runway one. The helicopter landed short of the runway in low brush, it was substantially damaged and the occupants were fatally injured.”

Medford Township Police Chief Richard Meder told NJ.com Friday authorities got a call about a helicopter “that was distressed” around 1 p.m EST.

Pilot James Evan Robinson was pronounced dead at the scene. Gentry was taken to nearby Virtua Hospital where he passed away from his injuries.

Rayner added a preliminary report with full details of the crash will be released to the public early next week.

A post shared by Montgomery Gentry (@montgomerygentry) on Jan 8, 2015 at 1:27pm PST

Gentry was born on April 5, 1967, in Lexington, Kentucky, where he met his bandmate and formed a group based off their last names. The duo had success on the country charts, scoring five No. 1 hits. The band was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 2008.

The duo is best known for their singles “My Town,” “Daddy Won’t Sell The Farm” and “Gone.”

Gentry leaves behind a wife and two daughters.

The boy’s dad, Ian Riley, said his son was playing around and is being accused of something he is too young to even understand.

The Rileys want the disciplinary action removed from their child’s record.

The strongest Category 5 storm ever recorded—Hurricane Irma—is expected to make landfall in Florida by the weekend and early next week. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has already declared a state of emergency in all 57 counties in Florida, sending many families in panic mode as they gather the essentials like food and water to prepare for the worse.

But it’s not just extra food costs that most households have to worry about, getting prepared for a major hurricane could cost a family thousands of dollars.

“This can run the average family about $5,000 or more for most evacuations. Go on Amazon and start adding the items and look at the cost of gasoline, which is rising due to Hurricane Harvey. Add on top of that additional expenses for hotel stays, portable stoves, plywood, and hardware, and you are looking at substantial losses,” Daniel Odess, President of GlobalPro Recovery, a Coral Gables-based company that helps businesses and homeowners with insurance risk.

The National Hurricane Center said families in danger zones need to have a “basic disaster supplies kit” available in case of a disaster that should include water, food (at least a three-day supply), battery-powered or hand crank radio, a flashlight, a whistle, tools, maps, and a first aid kit.

A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spokesperson told FOX Business that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season “will be one of the most destructive seasons” without a doubt, so families shouldn’t cut any corners when preparing.

Odess adds that while safety and the basic essentials should be everyone’s first priority—families should also start preparing for possible insurance claims down the road.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

Here are five things every family needs to do before a major hurricane, according to Odess.

1) Take photos and videos of your property. Don’t narrate the video, this is a documentary not a social media post.

2) Collect your policy forms. If you are running out of time, simply ask your agent or call the insurance company directly and ask for a copy of the declaration page. This contains all your coverages and limits and usually has the toll free number for the insurer on the face of it.

3) Collect emergency contact information for local authorities and reach out to your neighbors. What goes on next door can affect you and your property. You may need their help and they may need yours. Resources are limited, we all need to pitch in. You want to make sure your community can recover quickly and that takes a community effort. The only way we can work together is if we are communicating with each other. If you don’t know your neighbor, now is a good time to introduce yourself.

4) Locate your local shelter and large retail hardware store, i.e.: Home Depot or Lowes. Even if you don’t plan to go there, local and federal aid will collect at these locations. Also, following a storm communication is limited, i.e.: phones, TV, etc. and for the few days after the conditions can be dangerous. These shelters provide access to information. Government officials are constantly coordinated outreach and the distribution of information at these locations. As for the large retail hardware stores, Insurance companies and large CAT contractors tend to stage their efforts in these parking lots – they are big parking lots and offer immediate access to resources. With the majority of insurance claim money being spent at these retailers, it’s probably a good bet you’ll find someone there that can help.

5) Be prepared to wait. Don’t rush to report a claim and don’t expect immediate payment for your damages. So, have plenty of cash on hand to weather the aftermath of the storm. Your policy will require prompt notice, not immediate notice. Be prepared to take care of you family and your own personal immediate needs. Just because you report your claim immediately, doesn’t mean your property will be inspected first nor paid first. With adjusters deployed to hard hit areas like Texas, it’s going to take even longer. Understand that most of these adjusters will not be from the area. This means, they might not be familiar with the area, construction trends and costs, or even your insurance company. These individuals represent the interest of the insurance company, not yours and in the wake of a storm, insurance companies are pooling resources, which means hiring new independent adjusters to handle your claim on their behalf.

A Category 3 storm, Hurricane Maria is heading for the Turks and Caicos Islands Thursday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.
The National Hurricane Center predicted that it will continue to strengthen.
Hurricane Maria is 105 miles east-northeast of Puerto Planta, Dominican Republic and 155 miles southeast of Grand Turk Island, according to the National Hurricane Center's 11 a.m.

Residents in Saint Croix told Fox News that the storm left them without power and turned roads into mudslides.

A Category 3 storm, Hurricane Maria is heading for the Turks and Caicos Islands Thursday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.

Maria briefly downgraded to a Category 2 storm Wednesday but gained more strength by Thursday morning. The National Hurricane Center predicted that it will continue to strengthen.

Early Wednesday, Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, destroying hundreds of homes and knocking out power to the entire U.S. territory of 3.4 million people.

The storm's center passed near or over the U.S. Virgin Island of Saint Croix overnight Tuesday.

Saint Croix, largely spared the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Irma just weeks ago, this time experienced five hours of hurricane force winds, U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp said.

Here's what you should know about Maria’s path.

Where is Maria today?

Hurricane Maria is 105 miles east-northeast of Puerto Planta, Dominican Republic and 155 miles southeast of Grand Turk Island, according to the National Hurricane Center's 11 a.m. ET advisory Thursday.

HURRICANE WARNING VS. WATCH: HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT?

The storm is traveling northwest at 9 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph.

What else should I know about the hurricane?

The Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos Islands and Southeastern Bahamas are under a hurricane warning, the National Hurricane Center said.

“A warning means that hurricane conditions are expected whereas a watch means that conditions are possible,” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Ocean Service.

Maria already ravaged the Caribbean nation of Dominica, leaving “widespread devastation,” according to Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit.

WHAT IS THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE?

“So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace,” Skerrit said. “I am honestly not preoccupied with physical damage at this time, because it is devastating … Indeed, mind boggling. My focus now is in rescuing the trapped and securing medical assistance for the injured.”

When Maria hit Puerto Rico Wednesday, it was the third-strongest storm to make landfall in the U.S., based on its central pressure. It was even stronger than Irma when it hit the Florida Keys earlier this month.

Residents in Saint Croix told Fox News that the storm left them without power and turned roads into mudslides. Barges were also destroyed in the storm, residents said, causing concern not only for Saint Croix, but for nearby Saint Thomas and Saint John which had been receiving aid from the larger of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday criticized the legalization of marijuana in multiple states and warned that the federal law banning use and sale of the drug "remains in effect," remarks that could stoke fears of a federal crackdown.

"I've never felt that we should legalize marijuana," Sessions said in response to a question from a reporter during a press conference in San Diego announcing record-breaking narcotics seizures by the U.S. Coast Guard in fiscal 2017.

"It doesn't strike me that the country would be better if it's being sold at every street corner," he said, adding that medical organizations oppose it and federal law prohibits it.

Since taking over the helm of the Justice Department in February, Sessions has made drugs, violent crime and illegal immigration his three top law enforcement priorities.

It is still unclear exactly how his opposition to marijuana legalization will affect states such as Oregon, Washington, Colorado and California, which are among those that have legalized the medicinal and recreational use of pot.

During the Obama administration, former Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo spelling out the department's enforcement policy on marijuana.

The memo said the department would continue to enforce federal drug laws, but would not prioritize marijuana enforcement in pot-legal states with robust regulatory regimes.

In remarks last week, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told an audience at the Heritage Foundation that the guidance outlined in that memo was now under review.

"We are looking at the states that have decriminalized marijuana," Rosenstein said.

"I think there is some pretty significant evidence that marijuana turns out to be more harmful than a lot of people anticipated and it is more difficult to regulate than I think was contemplated by some of those states. We are going to take that all into consideration and then make a determination whether or not to revise that policy."

A task force created by a February executive order and comprised of prosecutors and other law enforcement officials was supposed to study marijuana enforcement, along with many other policy areas, and issue recommendations.

The group's recommendations were due in July, but the Justice Department has not made public what the task force determined was appropriate for marijuana.

Mrs. Clinton and her enablers are behaving much the same way they accused Donald Trump might behave in the face of losing the election.

----TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE---
By Stephen L. Miller, Fox News

“Donald Trump continues to undermine Clinton presidency 10 months after election loss.”

That would be the general feel and tone coming from outlets like Politico, CNN, the Washington Post and New York Times, not to mention the left-leaning news outlets that make no attempt to hide bias, had November 8th turned out differently. Donald Trump, instead of hosting meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, would be making the daily and nightly talk show rounds promoting his book “What the Hell Happened.”

We would be inundated by breathless think pieces about how Donald Trump refuses to accept the results of the election, a “direct threat to Democracy,” as Hillary Clinton called it in a tweet back on October 24th. Mrs. Clinton had stated earlier this week that, dependent upon the results of Robert Mueller’s investigation, she may contest the official results of the election. Contest them to whom, Mrs. Clinton? “The View” audience?

Hillary Clinton has been contesting the results of her historical election loss ever since she finished her concession speech. She still claims she won via popular vote, which is like saying you won the Super Bowl because you had more yards than the other team but fewer points. She’s blamed everything from Russia to Chardonnay for the fact she somehow thought Nebraska was a more winnable state for her than Wisconsin.

She coasts from one indulgent softball interview to another, trapped in her Munchausen reality where she actually is president and is really popular.

She is in fact neither of those things. She is not president no matter how many of her Hollywood friends console her to the fact, and she is the first losing presidential candidate in history to have their approval ratings actually get worse.

No one is saying she should shut up (except for maybe Democrat consultants). No one is saying she shouldn’t go on another whirlwind burrito bowl tour. She’s certainly entitled to her opinion and her book and all the free press and zero responsibility that comes with it. But just for a fun exercise, imagine the content coming from journalists and pundits had election night turned out differently:

“As President Clinton took in meetings at the UN this week, a historical first for the first female president, losing Republican candidate Donald Trump continued to excoriate her to national television audiences while promoting his book. On the same day Mrs. Clinton historically addressed the UN Assembly, a historical first, Donald Trump was once again playing showman on TV, this time to Stephen Colbert, who rolled his eyes through the 12-minute segment.

This might be fun to late night talk show audiences, but Donald Trump’s insinuations at election theft, as well as mansplaining to the first female president what she should have said at the UN, rocks the very foundations of our democratic republic to the core. Never before in our nation’s history has a losing candidate gone on an extended media blitz campaign to sabotage the agenda of their (female) opponent in front of the world. This has become a pattern for the former GOP nominee as he continues to undermine Mrs. Clinton’s history-making historical election victory almost ten months ago.”

And this is the problem these news outlets face as they try desperately to gain their credibility back from an election that was just as much about them as it was the Democrat party (redundant?). Mrs. Clinton and her enablers are behaving much the same way they accused Donald Trump might behave in the face of losing the election. What’s missing is the tone and nothing more.

This was all summed up nicely in Mrs. Clinton’s appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show, which felt more like an atonement for allowing Sean Spicer on the Emmy stage than it did a real interview. When the subject of North Korea came up, Clinton didn’t waste a second to respond with what she would have said.

“What I hoped the president would have said was something along the lines of, you know, we view this as dangerous to our allies, to the region, and even to our country. We call on all nations to work with us to try to end the threat posed by Kim Jung Un, and not call him Rocket Man, the old Elton John song, but to say, clearly, we will not tolerate any attacks on our friends or ourselves.”

The problem with Mrs. Clinton is we know exactly what she would have said at the United Nations as president, while ignoring the fact that she was Secretary of State during a period that saw North Korea’s audacity grow almost unchallenged on a world stage. This is the problem not only she faces, but an entire cabal of former Obama cabinet members content to vent on Twitter, while simultaneously acting like they just fell out of the sky and landed in a world with unparalleled diplomatic challenges.

Nothing Hillary Clinton writes and no amount of friendly late night interviews will change that, but in the alternate universe like the one I described above, we know how Trump (or any other GOP candidate behaving in this manner) would have been treated by the media-at-large if they were to embark on such a media endeavor under the guise of a pity party. By all appearances, Mrs. Clinton is still campaigning.

----SUMMARY ARTICLE---
Thousands gathered Thursday at the gates of Catalonia's judicial body in Barcelona to demand the release of a dozen officials arrested in connection with a vote on independence that Spanish authorities are challenging as illegal.
The arrests were the first involving Catalan officials since the campaign to hold an independence vote began in earnest in 2011.
"It's evident that we won't be able to vote like we have done in the past," Junqueras told broadcaster TV3.
"We want to vote because we have the right to decide, regardless of what we vote."
Polls consistently show the region's inhabitants favor holding a referendum but are roughly evenly divided over independence from Spain.

----TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE---
Thousands gathered Thursday at the gates of Catalonia's judicial body in Barcelona to demand the release of a dozen officials arrested in connection with a vote on independence that Spanish authorities are challenging as illegal.

The demonstrators answered a call by pro-independence civic groups to stage long-term street protests against the police surprise crackdown one day earlier.

Acting on a judge's orders, police seized 10 million ballot papers and arrested at least 12 people, mostly Catalan government officials, suspected of coordinating the referendum. The arrests were the first involving Catalan officials since the campaign to hold an independence vote began in earnest in 2011.

CATALONIA INDEPENDENCE BID: CAN ANY SIDE EMERGE AS WINNER?

Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras acknowledged that the crackdown had disrupted the referendum plans. "It's evident that we won't be able to vote like we have done in the past," Junqueras told broadcaster TV3.

Even so, he remained confident there will be a large turnout of Catalans on Oct. 1 — whatever form the vote takes. Pro-independence leaders have insisted the ballot will go ahead despite the obstacles.

The Catalan National Assembly, a driving force behind the secession movement, urged people to gather at noon Thursday outside the region's justice tribunal and bring tents if needed.

By midday, the protesting crowds filled a square the size of two soccer fields and erupted in slogans chanting "We will vote!" and "Hello democracy." Many wrapped themselves in the "estelada" flag, which has become a symbol of those in favor of an independent Catalan republic, and some climbed lampposts to get a better view.

"We will be here, peacefully but present, until all of the arrested walk out free," the Assembly's president Jordi Sanchez told the cheering crowds.

SPAIN'S CATALONIA REGION SETS INDEPENDENCE VOTE FOR OCT. 1 DESPITE PROTEST FROM MADRID

The regional police force cordoned off the area, and live video streaming from the ground showed people angrily whistling and jeering at a police officer who became entangled with a protester. There were no immediate reports of other major incidents, but the atmosphere was a mixture of the festive and the tense.

"Our motto is that we are not afraid," said Malena Palau, a 21 year-old student participating in Thursday's gathering. "We want to vote because we have the right to decide, regardless of what we vote."

The protesters' response had begun on Wednesday as news of the police raids on Catalan government offices and the arrests spread through social media. Some people camped out overnight at the gates of the regional department of economy, where civil guard investigators conducted a search and arrested two officials in charge of finances and taxation.

Various vehicles belonging to the Civil Guard force were vandalized and the officers had to be escorted away in the early hours of Thursday by regional police amid some scuffles.

MORE THAN 700 MAYORS IN SPAIN COULD FACE ARREST OVER CATALAN INDEPENDENCE VOTE

Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has warned Catalan leaders of "greater harm" if they don't call off the referendum bid.

Catalonia represents a fifth of Spain's 1.1-trillion-euro ($1.32 trillion) economy and enjoys wide self-government, although key areas such as infrastructure and taxes are in the hands of central authorities.

The region has about 5.5 million eligible voters. Polls consistently show the region's inhabitants favor holding a referendum but are roughly evenly divided over independence from Spain.

Residents of San Francisco’s exclusive Presidio Terrace neighborhood hired a lawyer in hopes of winning back the private street they lost to an investor for $90,000 back in April 2015, but some say they don’t have a case.

Many of the extremely wealthy residents didn’t even know the street was up for sale and were not pleased after it sold.

Presidio Terrace is an oval-shaped street sealed off by a gate from the tony Presidio Heights neighborhood. Lined with towering palm trees and multimillion dollar mansions, the street has been home, over the years, to famous residents including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Thanks to a city auction stemming from an unpaid tax bill, Bay Area real estate investor Michael Cheng, and his wife Tina Lam, bought the street and now own the sidewalks, the street itself and other areas of "common ground" in the private development that, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, has been managed by the homeowners association since at least 1905.

BETSY DEVOS’ VACATION HOME SPARKS UPROAR ON TWITTER

It turns out the homeowners association for Presidio Terrace failed to pay a $14-a-year property tax, something that owners of all 181 private streets in San Francisco must do, the Chronicle reported.

So the city's tax office put the property up for sale at the cost of $994 in an online auction to regain unpaid back taxes, penalties and interest. The couple eventually won the street with a $90,100 bid.

Scott Emblidge, the attorney for the Presidio Homeowners Association and former assistant city attorney, said in a letter to the city that the owners failed to pay because the tax bill was mistakenly being sent to the address of an accountant who hadn't worked for the homeowners association since the 1980s, the Chronicle reported.

Emblidge said the residents didn't know their street was put on the auction block, let alone sold, until May when a title search company hired by Cheng and Lam reached out to ask if any residents had interest in buying back the property.

That was one of several options Cheng and Lam have considered for making the investment pay off.

Another option is to charge residents to park on their street — and rent out the 120 parking spaces that line the grand circular road.

"As legal owners of this property, we have a lot of options," Cheng said, adding that nothing has been decided.

The Homeowners Association will meet with the Board of Supervisors in two months to argue for the reversal of the sale. Emblidge will head up the legal battle. They also hired former city attorney spokesman Matt Dorsey and Boe Hayward, onetime chief of staff for ex-Supervisor Bevan Dufty, to work with politicians behind the scenes and the media to get the story out.

But despite their heavy-hitting team, it might not be enough to win.

“Unless they can show clearly and convincingly that proper procedures were not followed, I see no reason to rescind the sale,” said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who was recently visited by the homeowners’ team of advocates, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

“Sales like this happen every day to all kinds of people and businesses,” he said.

----SUMMARY ARTICLE---
Some truck makers want to ditch the combustion engine entirely.
Still, many truck and engine makers say they plan to press ahead with their new designs, citing fleet owners' demands for fuel savings.
Truck makers are counting on fuel savings to revive sales.
Many of the company's engine technologies are in use overseas, where higher fuel prices and stricter pollution rules push faster adoption.
But pushing the limits of engine technology can be risky.

----TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE---
The average big rig travels less than 7 miles on a gallon of diesel fuel, making it one of the least-efficient vehicles on the road. Truck manufacturers want to change that.

Continue Reading Below

Spurred by new pollution regulations and sluggish demand, truck makers including Navistar International Corp. (NAV), Daimler AG, Paccar Inc. (PCAR) and Volvo AB, along with engine manufacturer Cummins Inc. (CMI), are rethinking everything from engine design to the shape of the trailer to bump up fuel efficiency.

Even small gains can have a big environmental impact. Each year in the U.S., roughly 1.7 million tractor-trailer trucks consume about 26 billion gallons of diesel. Getting an extra mile a gallon would equal removing more than 200,000 trucks from the road. It also could save trucking companies billions of dollars.

Some truck makers want to ditch the combustion engine entirely. Cummins introduced the industry's first fully-electric heavy-duty demonstration truck in August while Tesla Inc. (TSLA) plans to announce its own prototype next month. But it may be years before they hit the road in big numbers. Meanwhile, the industry is betting on squeezing fuel savings from diesel trucks.

"The race is on," said Steve Gilligan, vice president of marketing for Navistar's North America business. "Every truck manufacturer is looking for a technology advantage versus their competition."

The average heavy-duty truck, including short-haul and work vehicles like dump trucks, gets only about 5.9 miles a gallon, a figure that has barely budged in 10 years, according to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, an industry group. Federal regulators last October finalized rules requiring makers of heavy-duty trucks to boost fuel efficiency 14% by 2021, 20% by 2024 and 25% by 2027, based on a 2010 baseline.

The Trump administration seeks to roll back some aspects of the rules. Still, many truck and engine makers say they plan to press ahead with their new designs, citing fleet owners' demands for fuel savings.

Truck manufactures have seen first hand that regulations that result in better fuel economy can aid sales, even at higher prices. When truck and engine makers included a new exhaust-treatment system to comply with a tougher federal pollution standard in 2010, the side benefit of improved mileage propelled years of elevated demand. Truckers accelerated trade-ins of their older tractors to gain better fuel economy.

Such fuel-efficient technologies can add thousands of dollars to a rig's price, which can run $120,000 to $150,000 for the truck itself, or "tractor," and $25,000 to $30,000 more for the trailer.

"The new targets represent a real challenge for our industry," said John Mies, a Volvo spokesman. "Maximizing fuel economy has to be balanced with other factors."

Still, fuel efficiency could pay for itself. Long-haul trucks drive about 110,000 miles a year. So with diesel fuel at $2.50 a gallon, a 0.5 mile a gallon improvement in fuel efficiency could save some $3,100 per truck each year.

Even with today's technology, fleet operators are finding ways to save on fuel. Several leading fleets are already averaging over 7 mpg.

Many have added devices that improve aerodynamics, such as "skirts" around the base of the tractor and trailer, and winglike "tails" on the trailer back, manufacturers say. Some have opted for smaller engines, automatic transmissions or technologies that switch to electric power for the lights, climate system and other functions when the engine is idling.

Trucking company U.S. Xpress Enterprises Inc. orders about 1,500 tractors a year, and requests aerodynamic design elements like tails and skirts as well as automatic transmissions on its trucks. Today, its fleet averages over 7 mpg, from under 6 mpg five years ago.

"Fuel is such a large cost for us that we have every incentive to try to get to the best miles per gallon we possibly can," said Chief Executive Eric Fuller. "Any kind of technology that helps us get there usually pays for itself."

Truck makers are counting on fuel savings to revive sales. Orders for new trucks this year pulled out of a nearly two-year slump. Daimler, Volvo and other manufacturers last year reduced production and some laid off workers.

Cummins is joining with transmission manufacturer Eaton Corp. to design a lighter-weight engine and transmission that uses less fuel to shift gears, accelerate and slow down. Many of the company's engine technologies are in use overseas, where higher fuel prices and stricter pollution rules push faster adoption.

But these trucks cost more, making them a harder sell in the U.S. And some older, more seasoned truck drivers don't like the system's automatic transmission because it takes away control, though it can help in recruiting younger drivers since less training is required.

Volvo says its 2018 model is its most extensive redesign in over 20 years, promising a 7.5% boost in fuel efficiency due to aerodynamic improvements and other changes. Daimler says its new Freightliner Cascadia line achieves an 8% fuel-efficiency improvement through such things as hubcap covers and door seals that cut down on wind resistance. Paccar's newest Peterbilt models include lighter engines and automatic transmissions.

But pushing the limits of engine technology can be risky. Navistar lost customers after it rushed a new 13-liter engine into the market whose exhaust treatment system failed to reach the Environmental Protection Agency's 2010 standard and contributed to engine performance problems.

Last year, after years of losing money due to engine-warranty costs and saddled with a shrunken share of the heavy-duty truck market, the company sold a 17% stake to Volkswagen AG.

The 2018-model Navistar trucks boost fuel efficiency 9%, partly by adding more efficient engines and a "predictive" cruise-control system that anticipates changes in terrain and automatically adjusts speed. In years ahead, Navistar expects to incorporate VW's powertrain technology into its trucks.

Vehicle makers have designed prototype trucks that, on paper, could get 13 miles a gallon or more by incorporating the full range of existing fuel-saving technologies and aerodynamic designs. Their cabs have rounded edges like high-speed trains and are made of lightweight material, and would come with advanced engines and low-resistance tires.

Those prototypes, designed in part with federal funding under an Energy Department program known as SuperTruck, don't yet have a price tag.

"The technologies on that vehicle are not free," said Navistar's Mr. Gilligan. "We're demonstrating capability, not sale-ability."

Cheryl Burke is replacing former choreographer Abby Lee Miller on Lifetime’s “Dance Moms” — and the dancer was shocked by what she saw on set.

“It was tough, there were a lot of tears, anger and insecurity,” the 33-year-old told US Weekly Thursday. “It was shocking to me. I couldn’t believe these beautiful girls that have zero confidence. That’s not the way to live life.”

Miller is currently incarcerated and serving 366 days for fraud. Burke hinted the young girls participating in the series may have been impacted by the loud-mouthed 51-year-old, who was often depicted as screaming and making cruel remarks on set.

“They said they’ve been traumatized by Abby and her teaching methods,” said Burke. “That’s a shame because with teenagers it’s so important to mentor them. I’m not a yeller. But I am strict. I tell it how it is, especially with the mothers because I come from the original dance mom. She was hard on me, but in the right way.”

Burke added she could easily identify with the aspiring dancers and their struggles.

“I had people body-shaming me when I gained a lot of weight and as a teenager, your body is going to change,” she said. “To get through it, you need to have great family and friends.”

Burke is hoping her role will change the way fans see the hit reality TV series, as well as the girls participating.

Waste pullouts are a secret weapon of the well-oiled kitchen machine. They do the dirty job of handling your garbage, recycling and more. In fact, among surveyed homeowners who are remodeling a kitchen and upgrading cabinets, the No. 1 storage addition is a pullout waste or recycling cabinet, according to the latest Houzz kitchen trends study. But what makes them better than a regular garbage can? Actually, a pullout bin can have quite a few advantages, both in style and function. Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

RELATED: Pick Out the Perfect Drawer Pulls

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

RELATED: Kitchen Storage to Fit All of Your Needs

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.
