There were only a few studies that directly compared them, but they suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy may be even more effective at reducing symptoms and at resolving the anxiety disorders, and that the combination of medication and C.B.T. may be better than either was alone. The drugs were associated with a variety of adverse events, though they did not find the association with suicide attempts that has led to a black box warning on S.S.R.I.s. Still, they have not ruled out those dangers: “The difference may be due to underreporting and monitoring of suicide attempts in clinical trials,” Dr. Wang said.

Dr. Stephen P.H. Whiteside, the director of the Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the Mayo Clinic, who was one of the authors of the meta analysis, said, “if your child has difficulties with anxiety, first of all, it’s treatable. There are a variety of interventions that can be helpful.”

So which of those children — the parent-clinger, the dog-fearer, the school-avoider — needs psychotherapy or psychopharmacology?

“Anxiety happens in kids,” said Dr. Christopher K. Varley, a professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “It does not always need treatment.” And it does not always look exactly like what adults think of as anxiety, he said. Kids can have physical symptoms, or become disruptive; headaches and stomachaches and tantrums can all mean that a child is anxious.

“The important questions to me are, is this a problem, is it getting in the way of functioning, is it creating stress for the child and the family, is it causing pain and suffering?” he said.

“A big thing for families is that sometimes anxiety can lead to avoidance behavior in social settings and in school,” Dr. Fernandez said. But staying away from school is only going to make the problem worse, she said. “As a parent, all you want to do is make your child feel safe and feel comfortable, and if they’re saying, I only feel safe and comfortable home with my door shut, that can only exacerbate the problem.”

The most helpful form of therapy, Dr. Whiteside said, according to the evidence, is exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves helping kids face their fears in a supportive environment. “If they’re afraid of dogs, they have to practice petting dogs; if they’re afraid of talking to people, practice talking to people.” That seems to be of greater value for children with these problems than, for example, therapies based on changing thought patterns, or distractions, or even therapy aimed at deeper insight into the fears.

The message of exposure therapy, Dr. Whiteside said, is that the situations the child is avoiding are not as dangerous as the child’s anxiety would suggest, and that the child can cope with the anxiety. “It’s an uncomfortable feeling that you can handle,” he said, and the more the child handles it, the more proficient the child will become.

But this takes skill and experience on the therapist’s part, and an investment of time and resources by the family. “We found that C.B.T. reports the most consistent outcomes compared to placebo, but it’s time-consuming and sometimes in rural areas it’s not available,” Dr. Wang said.

The question of medication may arise for children with moderate to severe anxiety, and perhaps ideally for a child who is already getting psychotherapy. But of course, not everyone has access to the experts, or to the recommended forms of therapy. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed by primary care doctors, pediatricians or family physicians, doing their best to help their patients, sometimes getting guidance from a psychiatrist by phone.

“Even though it’s a common problem and there are treatments that work, there are still profound problems in the United States with access to psychotherapists who are versed in psychotherapy techniques that have been demonstrated to help,” Dr. Varley said. “And there clearly is a paucity of child psychiatrists.”

In an editorial accompanying the recent meta-analysis, researchers hailed the large numbers of children included, but warned that many children don’t respond fully to treatment, and that children who suffer from one form of anxiety disorder are often at high risk to develop another.

“The good news is I’ve had lots of patients who’ve had much better experiences and were able to deal with those ups and downs of life, who went to therapy and learned tools to deal, or needed a little help with medication,” said Dr. Fernandez.",Treating Anxiety in Children,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/well/family/treating-anxiety-in-children.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Soon after my 50th birthday, 10 years ago, I started keeping a list of “Things I will do/things I won’t do when I get old.”



It was a highly judgmental, and super secret, accounting of all the things I thought my parents were doing wrong. My dad lied chronically about taking his meds. He refused to get a hearing aid, telling others to “up their audio” (he had been a television producer). My mom smoked behind my back (she thought) until the day she was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was all too easy to call them out, and I recognized over and over just how awful it is to become feeble, sick and increasingly absent-minded, or worse.

Over the next decade I accumulated many pages of dos and don’ts, even as I fretted about exactly when I’d be old enough to start following my own advice. Recently I heard a sociologist on the radio call people in their early 60s, “the young old.” I imagine that my “young adult” nieces might consider me “old, old” already, but I don’t feel ready yet to start taking my own advice. I’m still working on building my list, not implementing it.

The entries on that list reflect my frustration of seeing the price my parents paid for their stubbornness. Take my mother’s terrifying driving, for instance. A growing number of fender benders, and worse, didn’t faze her, and she would not listen to any talk of her fading ability behind the wheel. In desperation, I reported Mom to the D.M.V. and they called her in for a road test. She failed it, and her license was revoked. It humiliated Mom, and tormented me.

Here’s how it appears on my list:

“If my driving capability is questioned, I will not reject the comment out of hand because I am afraid of losing my independence. I hope there will be self-driving cars by then. If nothing else works, I hope someone will turn me in.”

My biggest worry as I watched my parents grow old was their increasing physical frailty. Who hasn’t heard that hip fractures from falls are a leading cause of death among the elderly? I know my father had, if only because we talked about it with him ad nauseam. I pointed out the consequences of his own mother’s pride in refusing a cane or walker: At age 84, Grandma fell while riding the New York City subway alone, and that fall led over the months that followed to her death.",Things I’ll Do Differently When I’m Old,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/well/family/thing-ill-do-differently-when-im-old.html

When it examined internet freedom in 65 countries in 2016 and 2017 (representing 87 percent of global internet users), its Freedom on the Net project found governments in nearly half of the nations deploying some form of manipulation to distort online information to stay in power and undermine the opposition.

The practice has become significantly more widespread and technically sophisticated. Bots, propaganda producers and fake news outlets exploit social media and search algorithms to integrate seamlessly with trusted content, posing a devastating new threat to democracy. The dangers undermine elections, political debate and virtually every other aspect of governing.

In Turkey, 6,000 people have been enlisted by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party to manipulate discussions and counter opponents on social media. The government of President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico relies on an estimated 75,000 automated accounts — Peñabots — to overwhelm political critics on Twitter. In Iran, the government has long created internet sites that mimic those of legitimate news organizations like the BBC; these fakes are filled with conspiracy theories and anti-Western propaganda.

Unlike direct censorship, like shutting down mobile service, online content manipulation is difficult to detect and is far more difficult to combat, given the sheer number of people and bots deployed. The fabrication of grass-roots support for government policies creates a closed loop in which the authorities essentially use social media to endorse themselves, making the views of citizens irrelevant.

Restoring trust in social media and the internet requires defensive actions against the manipulation armies. A first step is for the United States and other democracies to ensure that political advertising is at least as transparent online as it is offline, an issue now being debated in Congress. Online political ads should be required to indicate who sponsored them; social media companies should have to make this information available and indicate the source of the payment for such ads.

As we have seen in recent weeks, big tech companies also face pressure from Congress and European governments to more aggressively weed out hate speech and to take other steps to remove online sludge. There is indeed room for smarter curation of news feeds and search algorithms — with more human oversight.

But these approaches, unless handled skillfully, also risk narrowing political debate and undermining internet freedom, as witnessed in Germany, where popular social media companies are now required to take down offending information quickly or risk fines of up to 50 million euros.

The problem is likely to get more complicated. More and more data is being collected about Americans’ political views, personal habits and sensitive financial and health information, while that data is becoming harder to keep secure from hackers and hostile governments.

Those forces are part of the weaponization of the internet used so skillfully by Russian operatives and their protégés. Online manipulation also becomes easier if perpetrators are able to identify a subgroup of people most susceptible to their message and most likely to share it with others in their network, a task made easier by the data-collection practices of popular social media companies.

There is no panacea; constant vigilance and education are required to attack this problem. Young people and other web users must be taught to take seriously the demands of cybersecurity. High schools should be including media literacy as part of history and social science curriculums.

Most of all, students and others must be put on alert that there really is fake news — false information deliberately planted by malevolent actors — and that they need to be on guard against propaganda masquerading as truth.

Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico’s largely isolated economy.","But few critics predicted it would transform the Mexican diet and food ecosystem to increasingly mirror those of the United States. In 1980, 7 percent of Mexicans were obese, a figure that tripled to 20.3 percent by 2016, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Diabetes is now Mexico’s top killer, claiming 80,000 lives a year, the World Health Organization has reported.

For many Mexicans, Nafta promised to make real “the fever dreams of joining the modern economy,” said Timothy A. Wise, a trade expert at the Small Planet Institute and Tufts University. “All former rural workers would be in new jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing industries of the post-Nafta world. That just hasn’t happened.”

“The only way that Mexico became a ‘first world’ country was in terms of diet.”

The phenomenon is not limited to Mexico. Research shows free trade is among the key factors that have accelerated the spread of low-nutrient, highly processed foods from the west, “driving the obesity epidemic in China, India, and other developing countries worldwide,” according to the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.

But Jaime Zabludovsky Kuper, Mexico’s deputy chief negotiator on the pact, said Nafta didn’t cause obesity. Instead, he said, it lowered food prices and reduced malnutrition. In 2012, 1.6 percent of Mexican children suffered from severe malnutrition, a sharp drop from 6.2 percent in 1988, according to government data.

Mr. Zabludovsky said that Mexicans had long been enticed by American food, and that high tariffs used to make it expensive, not unavailable. The economy is now more stable, he said, and Mexicans are living longer — which is partly why more people are dying from noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease. “It’s a symptom of relative prosperity,” he said.

The broader pros and cons of Nafta have come under increasing scrutiny given President Trump’s threats to dismantle it. Among its chief champions are American farm and food-retailing interests whose fortunes have benefited tremendously from the open market. Mexican exports to the United States have surged, and a more stable economic structure has evolved in Mexico. The country’s unemployment rate has stayed mostly constant, but average wages have fallen to $15,311 in 2016 from $16,008 in 1994, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico’s largely isolated economy.

In January, federal wildlife officials issued a report that called climate change the biggest threat to the survival of the polar bear.

Polar bears depend on sea ice as a platform for hunting seals. As the planet warms, that ice cover melts earlier and earlier, limiting the amount of time polar bears have to hunt and build up their fat reserves before moving to land. As a result, they can end up skinny and in poor physical health by the end of long ice-free summers.

Biologists agree that as ice cover continues to decrease, there will be a significant drop in the polar bear population, which according to federal wildlife officials stands at about 26,000 globally. A 2015 assessment projected a reduction of over 30 percent in the number of polar bears by 2050.

“Polar bears are built for a feast-or-famine type of eating,” said Elisabeth Kruger, an arctic wildlife program officer with the World Wildlife Fund. “But when that period of fasting gets too long, it can put them on the brink.”

Polar bears have been labeled threatened under the Endangered Species Act act since 2008. They are among the largest members of the bear species and prey heavily on seals.

All of which makes the viral images of a fur-and-bones polar bear particularly striking. The bear Mr. Nicklen and his team documented was stuck on land, its muscles atrophied by continuing starvation, and apparently on the edge of death.

One would have to do “a lot of specific investigating” to determine the cause of suffering for a particular polar bear, Ms. Kruger said, but what is captured in Mr. Nicklen’s photo “is one of the ways polar bears die.”

Most of the feedback Mr. Nicklen has received on social media appears positive, if twined with sadness. (The viral video of the polar bear, he noted, has been slowed from normal speed.) But he has also received blowback from some who have complained he did not do enough to help.

“People assume you’re just coldhearted,” he said. “Of course we’re upset.” But feeding the polar bear would not only prolong its misery, he said, it would have been illegal. And “for me to take a gun up to that polar bear and kill it, now you’re looking at jail.”

This is not the first time a downtrodden polar bear has captured the hearts of humans. After all, they are “incredibly charismatic,” Ms. Kruger said, and “big, white, fluffy creatures.”

Last year, a polar bear named Pizza garnered the support of millions of people worldwide when animal welfare advocates began a campaign to move “the world’s saddest polar bear,” as he was known, from a mall in southern China, where the bear lived in a glass enclosure.

New Yorkers are not known for collectively possessing a stiff upper lip. Complaining about life’s indignities tends to be a default position. But there is a notable exception, and it was amply displayed on Monday after an explosion in a busy transit corridor at Times Square. At such moments New York embodies the classic British slogan of World War II vintage: Keep calm and carry on.

The city barely blinked after the morning rush-hour blast, which officials described as a failed attempt at terrorism by an immigrant from Bangladesh who had strapped a pipe bomb to his body. He ended up wounding himself seriously and inflicting minor injuries on three others. No doubt, the communal reaction would have been more frantic had the toll been higher. But the normal rhythms of the city paused only briefly. New Yorkers have become quite adept at keeping their composure.

Partly that’s because they have no other choice. They know their city is destined to be in the cross hairs of assorted madmen responding to religious and political commands or simply to the demons rattling in their heads. It has long been thus.

A century ago, New York was a favored target for self-described anarchists. In 1920, a bomb planted in a horse-drawn wagon exploded outside the J. P. Morgan bank on Wall Street, killing more than 30 people. Back then, it was America’s most devastating act of terrorism. New York in the 1970s endured a series of deadly attacks by Croatian, Puerto Rican and anti-Castro Cuban nationalists. Now the concern is terrorism perpetrated primarily by Islamist radicals, like the horror on Halloween when an Uzbek immigrant drove a pickup truck along a bike path in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 12 others.

In the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department has worked hard to keep the city safe. But it can’t head off every attack, especially one like Monday’s, committed apparently by a lone wolf possibly inspired by the Islamic State. Nor is President Trump’s ban on travelers from eight countries, six of them predominantly Muslim, any help. None of the men accused of the most recent assaults in New York and elsewhere in the United States came from those countries. The far greater threat comes from disaffected homegrown terrorists with ready access to handguns and rifles.

A recent upsurge in interest in all things royal should provide a boost to Netflix’s pricey prestige bio-drama. After a first season that covered Queen Elizabeth II’s ascension to the throne and the last days of her governing partnership with Winston Churchill, “The Crown” returns with ten more episodes, stretching from the mid-1950s to the early ’60s. Claire Foy is back as the Queen, striving to hold her empire together in an era where youthful revolution and anticolonial fervor hung heavy in the air.

Amid all the fannish squabbling over whether the recent crop of superhero movies is too serious or too silly, there’s scarcely been a better time to revisit writer-director Christopher Nolan’s widely beloved Batman movie, which drops Christian Bale’s morally conflicted caped crusader and the late Heath Ledger’s anarchic Joker into a gritty Gotham City. Looking more like a documentary than a comic book movie — and as entertaining as it is ambitious — “The Dark Knight” is a gripping crime-fighting adventure that doubles as a sophisticated exploration of lost ideals.

It’s easy to make money off a Christmas movie, but harder to produce one that becomes a new holiday classic. The 2003 Will Ferrell vehicle “Elf” accomplished the latter so well that it inspired a Broadway musical and a TV special. The original film’s still the superior product though, telling the alternately goofy and heartwarming tale of a naïve, gawky Santa Claus employee who travels to New York City to meet his real father — and quickly discovers that the cold real world could use a lot more of the North Pole’s warmth.

It was strangely satisfying to blast a plank of wood across the lab and hear it penetrate plywood with a loud crack. The only other projectile I’d ever fired came out of a rifle I shot, for the first time ever, at a farm in Kansas last year, where I was reporting on an article on the politics of climate change.

Perhaps it’s because I’m from a uniquely disaster-prone country, but I’ve always seen the specter of natural disaster as a matter not of if, but of when. (Japan’s capital, Tokyo, is one of the world’s most vulnerable to all manner of disasters, including floods, storms, storm surges, earthquakes and tsunamis.) So it was refreshing to talk to researchers who shared my impending sense of doom — and who were doing something about it.

Some of the research at the lab goes toward establishing industry standards and codes for roof assemblies and other building materials. The research also informs recommendations FM Global makes to its clients — to use a certain type of flood barrier, for example, or a sprinkler system.

Of course, insurance companies, which are society’s great aggregators of risk, have a big incentive to make sure companies do more to address natural and other disaster threats. They have also been the most outspoken on the dangers posed by climate change — though Louis Gritzo, the facility’s research manager, told me it tries to steer clear of debates over the science with clients.

“We’re not going to get into an argument over what caused it,” he said. “But we can tell them about the hazards. We can be factual about here’s the data that we have, here’s the science that we’ve used, and here’s what we believe your hazards to be.”

Though there isn’t a link to climate change, an earthquake shake table at the lab brought back memories. Those are a regular sight in Japan, training schoolchildren to duck under tables and ride out the tremor.

One thing I learned, though, was that the real event is always far more terrifying. When a magnitude 7.2 quake hit my hometown, Kobe, in 1995, the earth’s convulsions were far stronger than any recreated on a shake table. That’s something the researchers here are well aware of.

The regulations are binding and enforced by each country’s national telecom regulators.

For the European Union’s sprawling market of over 500 million citizens, the rules have mostly helped prevent bad behavior.

“There is not a long trail of abuse by telecom operators in net neutrality,” said Philippe Defraigne, a director at Cullen International, a Brussels-based consultant that covers telecoms and the digital economy.

That’s largely because unlike in the United States, Europeans have plenty of choices for internet access at home and on their mobile phones. France has four major mobile and internet operators and nine low-cost offshoots. Britain has more than 50. And there aren’t dominant giants born of megamergers, like the ones between Comcast and NBC Universal, and Verizon and AOL.

Even so, telecom operators in Europe have tried to take advantage of some of the gray areas in the rules.

When Netflix entered the European market in 2012, some national telecom companies forced it to pay “tolls” to deliver content to customers. Netflix did not name the companies but told a regional regulator in a letter that the dispute showed “the importance of strong net neutrality rules.”

The bloc’s rules also left open a major regulatory loophole for a practice called zero rating, in which a mobile network does not charge for data used on certain applications or services, giving them a leg up against competitors. The few regulatory disputes that have arisen in Europe have mostly involved big telecom companies that steer users to Facebook and other services.

Mr. Pai dismantled zero ratings protections in the United States even before he unveiled the plan to undo net neutrality rules entirely.

In Europe, the loophole created a confusing patchwork of interpretations in different countries over whether zero rating violates net neutrality. Sweden’s regulator concluded that the Telia offer didn’t treat internet traffic equally and should be halted. Want to stream music from a scrappy Spotify competitor? Telia would “throttle,” or artificially slow, that service once users reached their data caps, although they could keep listening to Spotify.

That doesn’t necessarily bother consumers.

“From a user perspective, I don’t think it’s a problem and I think most consumers don’t think it’s an issue,” said Magnus Haglunds, a Stockholm-based independent music producer who uses the Telia service. “There are those who may have to change from Apple Music to Spotify. But then they get free surfing on Spotify.”

Wasn’t net neutrality being compromised? “It’s not Cuba,” Mr. Haglunds replied. “Cuba has a problem. There they don’t have any internet at all.”

But the offer alarmed Swedish media companies, which warned that the deal gave Facebook an advantage over competitors, and Telia an edge over other telecom operators.

In February, Indian regulators shut down a separate Facebook zero rating deal with the mobile phone carrier Reliance Communications, saying carriers should not be allowed to “shape the users’ internet experience.”

A Swedish court ultimately overturned the decision on technical grounds after Telia appealed. Telia continues to offer the service in Sweden and other Nordic countries. But Sweden’s administrative court is expected to issue a broader decision on zero rating rules this year.

Critics of the rollback in the United States have cited zero ratings schemes in Europe, or versions of it, as an omen of how the web may be split.

Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, posted a screen grab on Twitter from the Portuguese mobile carrier Meo that went viral. The shot showed basic monthly subscription plans with names like Social, Messaging and Video, each appearing to favor a batch of established apps.

“Providers are starting to split the net into packages,” Mr. Khanna wrote.

In Germany, a similar case involved a Deutsche Telekom offer called StreamOn, which allows users to access unlimited videos and music from specific partners like Netflix. The country’s telecom regulator approved the deal, drawing criticism from consumer activists. StreamOn sought to address some of the concerns by expanding the offer to include around 50 partners.

“This a battle for the next century,” said Klaus Müller, the chairman of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, a lobbying group. “We can either have oligarchical markets with huge players, or a big variety of companies with lots of competition, which would be good for consumers but bad for big business.”

Many in Europe are watching the F.C.C. ruling with trepidation. Over 200 European companies signed a letter to Mr. Pai warning that ending the net neutrality rules will undermine privacy, free speech and competition on the internet.

Robert Beens, the chief executive of Startpage, a Dutch privacy-based encrypted search engine used by surveillence-wary consumers who don’t want their search data recorded, said his company could be put in jeopardy.

Half of the 2 billion searches done annually through Startpage are in the United States. If American I.S.P.s start charging companies to be in the internet’s fast lane, Mr. Beens said he would not be able to keep up with deep-pocketed competitors like Google, Bing and Yahoo.

“People want privacy, but what if we can’t pay the amounts of money that I.S.P.s are looking for?” he said. “In the U.S., people would have a slower connection to our search engine. It could really harm our business model.”

Perhaps the biggest issue for Europe — and other parts of the world — is that countries watch what the United States does.

“The U.S. set good standards for the globe, but now they could go backward,” said Maryant Fernández Pérez, a senior policy adviser at European Digital Rights, an association of civil and human rights organizations advocating an open digital environment.

But beyond the riverbeds, in an area once known for its bustling tea gardens, Dooars’s dirt roads can be perilous. They are barely proper roads, and the commute to school by foot is long and dangerous, making girls easy targets for attackers and traffickers.

“They’re like fishermen waiting for the bait,” said Smita Sharma, a photojournalist documenting survivors and their families.

The area has become a hub for domestic servitude trafficking. Girls as young as 10 are put in households through traffickers posing as placement agencies. They are almost always taken by someone they know — a relative, a neighbor, an acquaintance — and sold for $300 to $1,000. Ms. Sharma had already been working over the last three years on documenting survivors of sexual violence in India. But she kept coming across women who had been trafficked and sold into domestic servitude, an industry she says gets little attention in comparison.

“These girls are not in demand in the sex industry because they are too dark and skinny. That is why they are sold as domestic slaves,” Ms. Sharma said. “If they were more fleshy or voluptuous, they would be in high demand in the sex trade.”

Employers engage the services of placement agencies, looking for domestic help, but what they don’t know is that some of these girls arrived via a modern day slave trade. They were kidnapped, sold to placement agencies and then put in houses for domestic work. Each handler — from kidnapper to agency — receives a commission. Some people try to justify the trafficking in servants as being beneficial to the young victims. “People have this attitude that these people are poor, if I’m taking her and giving her shelter and food that’s enough,” Ms. Sharma said. “But that’s not enough, that is against human rights violations.”

Ms. Sharma, who splits her time between Delhi and Calcutta, has met at least 30 women who are survivors of the region’s trafficking. She has partnered with Shakti Vahini, an anti-trafficking organization, and local police to connect her to trafficking survivors and the families of missing girls.

“Sometimes they’ve been abused in the houses, and many of them are beaten up badly,” Ms. Sharma said. “You have to make them comfortable and make them trust you, but they do share their stories.”

People in the region make on average $1.50 a day, if employed at all, Ms. Sharma said. Tea gardens were once the backbone of the local economy, home to tea growing operations, hospitals and even schools. But once the British left in 1947, so too did the jobs, forcing people to look elsewhere for work. Many collect stones from the riverbed that are sold for construction.

While offers of domestic work can sound attractive to an impoverished teenager, the reality is horrific. One girl was kidnapped, taken on a train and raped outside a connecting railway station. She somehow escaped, eventually making her way back to her village with a police escort. The girl was taken to the police station along with her attacker. But the perpetrator’s relatives antagonized her and pressured her to withdraw her charges. The girl wasn’t even allowed to see her parents, in hopes of weakening her.

Photo

Ms. Sharma said it was so easy to set up a placement agency, that some of the families of the young women were unaware how they ended up as domestic servants. In one case, a mother of three who was a victim of domestic violence went to her mother for safety. But her mother couldn’t take her in. That’s when a man promised her a good job in the city. Instead, she was sold into servitude and placed in a house. It took a year before the woman broke down and told her employers how she had ended up in their home. The police were eventually contacted, and the woman was returned home to her husband.

While Ms. Sharma is listening to and telling the stories of survivors and their families, she’s also healing a wound of her own. When Ms. Sharma was 18, a professor molested her one day after school. But when she spoke out about it, she was told she was “over smart” and “didn’t know how to respect my elders,” she said.

That’s why she became a photojournalist. After studying in New York, she returned to India to begin her work on photographing survivors of sexual violence in India.

Today, she’s more driven than ever.

“I lost total confidence,” she said, “and I thought, ‘I have to do something with my life that’s meaningful and one day when I speak up, people are going to listen.’”

JAY-Z That's who I — that's who I am.
I don't know if he's had the level of — I mean, I had to survive by my instincts.","My conversation with Jay-Z began with O.J. When I was a kid growing up in black New Orleans in the 1960s, O.J. Simpson was a god. We imitated his moves, his swagger. We didn’t want to just play like him. We wanted to be him, gorgeous and running in the California sun. We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American, clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as “The Great One.” We were triumphant when he won it the next year. But O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote. So when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his song “The Story of O.J.,” from his most recent album, “4:44,” in which he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line “I’m not black, I’m O.J.” I was less engaged by the rapper’s marital troubles or his infamous, caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self — a black man who grew up in the ’70s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn. It seemed from his new body of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had been stirring more deeply within him — much the way it stirs in me, a Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for me. What is it about the story of O.J. Simpson that moved us both? O.J. must have locked down part of himself when he presented himself as the noncontroversial star who never talked about race, the perfect foil for his fellow football player, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, who seemed more threatening, angry. I had to wonder if the pressure of that denial caused him to explode decades later. All of this was on my mind when I met with Jay-Z for two hours in an executive office at The Times this past September. Besides O.J. and racial identity, we talked about his mother’s sexuality, and how he could possibly raise socially aware children who shuttled between mansions: After years of rapping about growing up in the ‘hood, he has produced an album that sounds like a middle-aged black man’s deeply introspective therapy session put to music.

This interview has been edited and condensed. Annotations by Wesley Morris, critic at large for The New York Times, and Reggie Ugwu, pop culture reporter for The New York Times.

DEAN BAQUETFirst, welcome.

JAY-ZThank you.

BAQUET The things I want to talk to you about: I want to talk a little bit about race. Your music some, too. I thought the song [""The Story of O.J.,"" from the album ""4:44,"" 2017] was particularly powerful. I took the message as, ""You can be rich, you can be poor, you're still black."" Who were you speaking to? Who did you want to listen to that and be moved by it?

JAY-Z It's a nuanced song, you know. It's like, I'm specifically speaking to us. And about who we are and how do you maintain the sense of self while pushing it forward and holding us to have a responsibility for our actions. Because in America, it is what it is. And there's a solution for us: If we had a power base together, it would be a much different conversation than me having a conversation by myself and trying to change America by myself. If I come with 40 million people, there's a different conversation, right? It's just how it works. I can effect change and get whomever in office because this many people, we're all on the same page. Right? So the conversation is, like, ""I'm not rich, I'm O.J."" For us to get in that space and then disconnect from the culture. That's how it starts. This is what happens. And then you know what happens? You're on your own, and you see how that turned out.

BAQUET Was it a reminder, too, that the thing O.J. forgot, maybe, was that as rich as he was, as entitled as his life was, he was reminded very forcefully when he became a subject of racial debate that he was also a black man, whether he accepted that or not?

JAY-Z That's right. Absolutely. And for us, like I'm saying, to speak to that the point is, ""Don't forget that,"" because that's really not the goal. The goal is not to be successful and famous. That's not the goal. The goal is, if you have a specific God-given ability, is to live your life out through that. One. And two, we have a responsibility to push the conversation forward until we're all equal. Till we're all equal in this place. Because until everyone's free, no one's free, and that's just a fact.

BAQUET When you're as amazingly successful as you are, your kids will live in a very different world from the world you grew up in. How do you go about making sure that they understand the world you grew up in?

JAY-Z There's a delicate balance to that, right? Because you have to educate your children on the world as it exists today and how it got to that space, but my child doesn't need the same tools that I needed growing up. I needed certain tools to survive my area that my child doesn't need. They're growing up in a different environment.1 But also they have to know their history. Have a sense of what it took to get to this place. And have compassion for others. The most important thing I think out of all this is to teach compassion and to identify with everyone's struggle and to know these people made these sacrifices for us to be where we are and to push that forward — for us. I believe that's the most important thing to show them, because they don't have to know things that I knew growing up. Like being tough.

1Reggie Ugwu: Jay-Z anticipated this dilemma on the 2011 song "" Jay-Z anticipated this dilemma on the 2011 song "" New Day "" from the album "" Watch the Throne ,"" in which he and Kanye West both address verses to their future sons. In Jay's verse, he raps: ""Took me 26 years just to find my path / My only job is cut the time in half."" (Jay-Z's son, Sir, and his twin sister, Rumi, were born last June . His eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, is 5.)

BAQUET Do you worry at all that as much as you will teach them history, and as much as you yourself are seen as an important figure among black people in America, that there's something they'll be missing? Or do you think that's silly, [that] in fact they'll have so many advantages that that's too negative of a way to approach it?

JAY-Z Exactly. Like, they'll be who they are, right? And it's just certain tools that you would hope for your child to have. You know, like, again, fairness and compassion and empathy and a loving heart. And those things translate in any environment. Those are the main base things that you want — well, for me, I would want my child to have. You know? Treat people as they are, no matter who they are, no matter where they sit in the world, not to, like, be super nice to someone at a high position or mean to someone who they've deemed to be below them. I can't buy you love, I can't show it to you. I can show you affection and I can, you know, I can express love, but I can't put it in your hand. I can't put compassion in your hand. I can't show you that. So the most beautiful things are things that are invisible. That's where the important things lie.

BAQUET For me as a black man of a certain age, when I was a kid O.J. Simpson was God. I'm 61, so I was a little kid when he was [around]. Do you expect black people and white people and young people and old people to hear different things in your music? I'm sure I heard some things in that song that you may not even have thought of 'cause I'm a different generation. What do you want a young white kid to hear in that song that maybe a young black kid would not hear?

JAY-Z That's a great question. I think when you make music, you want people to hear different things, and then you want it to start a dialogue. Because that's how we get to understanding. ""Oh, you felt that way about it."" ""This is actually what I meant, because this happened, and these things happened, that led to me saying this specific thing.""

BAQUET How did you react when that one line in that song where you referred to Jews and wealth2 [""You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it""] — some people got upset. How did you feel about that?

2Reggie Ugwu: A representative of the Anti-Defamation League A representative of the Anti-Defamation League told Rolling Stone , ""the lyric does seem to play into deep-seated anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews and money.""

JAY-Z I felt it was really hypocritical. Only because it's obvious the song is, like, ""Do you want to be rich? Do what people got rich done."" Of course, it's a general statement, right? It's obviously a general statement, like the video attached to it was a general statement. And if you didn't have a problem with the general statement I made about black people, and people eating watermelon and things like that [the animated music video for the song, which references racist cartoons, includes a caricature of a black man eating watermelon] — if that was fine, [but] that line about wealth bothered you, then that's very hypocritical, and, you know, that's something within yourself. 'Cause basically, I was saying, you know, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, is a great basketball player. He trains in the off-season. If you want to be great, train in off-season like him. That's basically the statement. You can't miss the context of the song. You have to be like 5 years old or something.

BAQUET Some people think that the election of Donald Trump has revived the debate about race in America. Some people think that, in fact, there's always been racism in America; that it hasn't changed and that the debate isn't any different. It's just people are paying attention to it. What do you think?

JAY-Z Yeah, there was a great Kanye West line in one of [his] songs: ""Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it."" [""Never Let Me Down,"" from West's 2004 album, ""The College Dropout.""] Take a step back. I think when Donald Sterling3 got kicked out of the N.B.A., I thought it was a misstep, because when you kick someone out, of course he's done wrong, right? But you also send everyone else back in hiding. People talk like that. They talk like that. Let's deal with that.

3Reggie Ugwu: In 2014, Sterling, then owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was In 2014, Sterling, then owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was banned for life from the N.B.A. after a recording emerged in which he made racist comments about black people to a female friend.

I wouldn’t just, like, leave him alone. It should have been some sort of penalties. He could have lost some draft picks. But getting rid of him just made everyone else go back into hiding, and now we can’t have the dialogue. The great thing about Donald Trump being president is now we’re forced to have the dialogue. Now we’re having the conversation on the large scale; he’s provided the platform for us to have the conversation.

BAQUET And you think that's better? That we should be having a conversation?

JAY-Z Absolutely. That's why this is happening.

BAQUET Do you think the debate over race in America is happening in a healthy way?

JAY-Z Well, an ideal way is to have a president that says, ""I'm open to dialogue and fixing this."" That's ideal. But it's still happening in a good way, because you can't have a solution until you start dealing with the problem: What you reveal, you heal.

BAQUET Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

JAY-Z Right? If I have like a tumor, and I don't know it, it doesn't mean it goes away. I have to diagnose it first. No matter how it happens. If I get hit with a football, and, like, Oh, I feel something there, and then I go to the doctor — it still happened.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z You know what I'm saying? So however it happens, we're just getting hit with a lot of footballs. To use [an] analogy that goes next to the N.F.L.

BAQUET If you were an owner, you would sign Colin Kaepernick, right?

JAY-Z Yeah. I dedicated ""The Story of O.J."" to him at the Meadows concert.4

4Wesley Morris: Ah, Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, whose protest against racism and racial inequality in America might be the most incendiary act of political umbrage since Ah, Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, whose protest against racism and racial inequality in America might be the most incendiary act of political umbrage since Kanye West declared , at a 2005 national telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina, that George W. Bush ""doesn't care about black people."" Kaepernick's decision last year to take a knee during the performance of the national anthem has since been adopted by dozens of other athletes. The president's outrage at the protests and the ensuing debate have upstaged the injustice Kaepernick knelt against. In October, after several months without being signed to a team, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the N.F.L. accusing the owners of collusion against him. So there's an apt sting in dedicating ""The Story of O.J."" to him, since he's now taking a hit for being agreeable, race-blind O.J. Simpson's opposite.

BAQUET Have you met him?

JAY-Z No. We just had dialogue over the phone, but we supposed to get together.

BAQUET Do you have any doubt that if this had not happened, he would be signed by a team?

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah. Of course.

BAQUET Do you think basketball is more politically active than football?

JAY-Z Yeah.

BAQUET Why is that?

JAY-Z I think because, first of all, it's smaller numbers. It's 12 people on a team. In football you have 53 people. So it's harder to get 53 people thinking the same thing. It's easier to have a conversation to get 12 people on the same page. For one. Two, [the N.B.A. has] a great ... they have a great commissioner5 who's really open. And, you know, supports them. And you feel that. You feel like, you know, when you have someone behind you that really believe in what's right, it motivates you to do the right thing. I think those two factors show why they're much further along.

5Wesley Morris: Adam Silver is the current, generally beloved N.B.A. commissioner. He has yet to drastically stifle expressions of political empathy by teams or individual players. (Let's see what happens should a player defy his expectation that all N.B.A. players Adam Silver is the current, generally beloved N.B.A. commissioner. He has yet to drastically stifle expressions of political empathy by teams or individual players. (Let's see what happens should a player defy his expectation that all N.B.A. players stand during the anthem .) Silver has merrily ridden for the last two years on the N.B.A. float in New York City's gay pride parade. He oversaw the expulsion of the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who could never have remained in the league — his continued presence might have torn it apart. Ridding basketball of Sterling started as many conversations about the sort of open-carry racism we're currently living with as keeping him around would have. One thing that makes Silver a great commissioner is that he understands that.

BAQUET Are there incidents even at this stage in your life — you're famous, you're rich, you own stuff — where you run into racism that's evident to you, that's easy to recognize?

JAY-Z Yeah. Yes. Yeah. But it mostly comes when you try to challenge the status quo.

If I’m being quiet and entertaining, everyone’s cool. Ah man, it’s great. You don’t feel racism. But when you try to challenge the club, it’s like, Oh, nah, we should have a seat at — to use the Solange album title — we should have a seat at this table. And then it gets into a space where it’s like, wait, you guys are mad at me about the same thing you guys are doing. It gets into a weird space.

BAQUET Are you in meetings now in your business life6 where you're the only black man in the room?

6Reggie Ugwu: Jay-Z's numerous business ventures — launched in parallel to his prolific music career — created a template for the rapper/mogul. He is the founder of the entertainment company and record label Roc Nation, owns the champagne brand Armand de Brignac and co-owns the Jay-Z's numerous business ventures — launched in parallel to his prolific music career — created a template for the rapper/mogul. He is the founder of the entertainment company and record label Roc Nation, owns the champagne brand Armand de Brignac and co-owns the streaming service Tidal , among other businesses.

JAY-Z Well, when I was doing the Nets7, I was definitely the only black guy in the room.

7Reggie Ugwu: Jay-Z acquired a Jay-Z acquired a small minority stake in the New Jersey Nets in 2003. (He sold it in 2013.) He played an influential role in bringing the team to Brooklyn, including helping design the new team logo and jerseys.

BAQUET And what was that like? Describe that.

JAY-Z It was um, it's strange, but at the same time I think that ... I think that in that room, my celebrity allowed me a voice that probably would have been awkward for someone [else] in my position being the only black person in the room to break through.

BAQUET This album [""4:44.""] sounds to me like a therapy session.

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah.

BAQUET Have you been in therapy?

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah.

In “Glory” (2017), created exclusively for T, the London-based artist Chantal Joffe found herself able to connect with the wonder and weight of parenthood that Jay-Z so clearly expresses in his 2012 song of the same name. Courtesy of Victoria Miro, London/Venice and Cheim & Read, New York.

BAQUET First off, how does Jay-Z find a therapist? Not in the Phone book, right?

JAY-Z No, through great friends of mine. You know. Friends of mine who've been through a lot and, you know, come out on the other side as, like, whole individuals.

BAQUET What was that like, being in therapy? What did you talk about that you had never acknowledged to yourself or talked about?

JAY-Z I grew so much from the experience. But I think the most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a ... you're at such an advantage. You know, you realize that if someone's racist toward you, it ain't about you. It's about their upbringing and what happened to them, and how that led them to this point. You know, most bullies bully. It just happen. Oh, you got bullied as a kid so you trying to bully me. I understand.

And once I understand that, instead of reacting to that with anger, I can provide a softer landing and maybe, “Aw, man, is you O.K.?” I was just saying there was a lot of fights in our neighborhood that started with “What you looking at? Why you looking at me? You looking at me?” And then you realize: “Oh, you think I see you. You’re in this space where you’re hurting, and you think I see you, so you don’t want me to look at you. And you don’t want me to see you.”

BAQUET You think I see your pain.

JAY-Z You don't want me to see your pain. You don't ... So you put on this shell of this tough person that's really willing to fight me and possibly kill me 'cause I looked at you. You know what I'm saying, like, so ... Knowing that and understanding that changes life completely.

BAQUET Was that a moment that came from therapy?

JAY-Z Yeah — just realizing that, oh my goodness, these young men coming from these ... they just in pain.

BAQUET Mm-hmm.

JAY-Z You have to survive. So you go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode what happen? You shut down all emotions. So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect.

BAQUET You can't connect because of the way you feel about yourself, you mean?

JAY-Z Yes. In my case, like it's, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity ...

BAQUET You've bared your soul so much. Not only in this album — you can sort of see the evolution of a person in your music. Part of me would think, Oh my god, I gotta talk about my marriage, I gotta talk about my mother, I gotta talk about my other ancestors. Part of me would think that would make me nuts. Does it make you nuts, or do you feel like the heart of your art is to tell the story of your life?

JAY-Z That's who I — that's who I am. And I've done it from the beginning of my career. Two things: one, no one knew the characters [back then]. So it wasn't as impactful. And two, it wasn't coming from a place where it was as evolved.8 And it's very difficult. It's hard to hear songs back. It's hard to perform ... songs, but, um, I feel it's the most important work that I've done and I'm very proud of it and the effect that it's having on people. Even like the studio sessions, you know, we were having four-hour conversations after playing one song. I learned so much about people that was around me, just my friends, I learned things about them that I didn't know, in a 20-year relationship, just from this one song. So I knew it would have that sort of impact beyond myself. It's my responsibility as an artist to go to these places.

BAQUET But you probably couldn't have gotten away with, O.K., you do the album, wife, that talks about our pain, I'm gonna go do an album that talks about, you know, my love of art.

JAY-Z Yeah, you just, you never know. I think it turned out for the best, but you just never know, because people like to be entertained. Again, back to our president. You would think, Man, after the composed manner in which Obama stood at that podium, the dignity he brought to that place, that this couldn't exist. But it does.

“Jay-Z with Blue Ivy” (2017), created exclusively for T by Chantal Joffe, who is well known for her tender, gestural portraits of women and children. “I couldn’t stop painting them,” the artist says of the music mogul and his eldest child. “There was something about the juxtaposition of their two heads that was so beautiful; I don’t paint men very often, and his face — it was like a Picasso, full of planes.” Courtesy of Victoria Miro, London/Venice and Cheim & Read, New York.

BAQUET Do you have any disappointments in Obama? There are people who say the expectations of him as the first black president were so great: He was supposed to get rid of racism and fix everything. Is that unfair? Did he live up to all of your expectations?

JAY-Z Yes, because all he could do was the best he can do. He's not a superhero. And it's unfair to place unfulfillable expectations on this man just because of his color. You're actually doing the opposite. It's like, what do you think is gonna happen? He's there for eight years. And he has to undo what 43 presidents have done. In eight years. That's not fair.

BAQUET What do you think of the state of — I'm not gonna say just black leadership, but leadership, period, on the things you care about in the country? Who do you, like, look at and say, ""This man or woman speaks for the things I care about?""

JAY-Z [laughs] I find it funny, but ... I like Dave Chappelle's [laughs].

BAQUET [laughs] Go ahead.

JAY-Z You know what I'm saying?

BAQUET You gonna vote for Dave Chappelle for president?

JAY-Z Yeah. 'Cause he tells it in humor so you can deal with it, but it's always a nice chunk of truth in there.

BAQUET Is there a part of you, because you have a certain amount of money, that gets a little more conservative, or has having money9 not changed your politics?

9Reggie Ugwu: I love the politeness in the phrase ""a certain amount of money."" Jay-Z's net worth is an estimated $810 million. He spent most of 2013's "" I love the politeness in the phrase ""a certain amount of money."" Jay-Z's net worth is an estimated $810 million. He spent most of 2013's "" Magna Carta Holy Grail "" both admiring his wealth and wielding it. Being a rich black rapper had put him on the defensive when his strongest creative mode involves the moral costs and social perks of his being self-made. One of the most poignant aspects of the new album is the way he's trying to reconcile what affluence means for him, his family and his race.

JAY-Z No. No, because I believe in people. I want what's best for people. I love people. You know, so I don't have that sort of thing, like, I want to vote Republican just to save more money.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z That's not the endgame. It's not about who got more money and who got more houses. Yes, you know, you've earned it, buy what you want.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z You know? But don't forget what's important. Without people, being rich would be very boring.

BAQUET Right [laughs].

JAY-Z [laughs] No one to share with, no one to have ... You know what I mean? You'd just be a rich person, one person on the planet — just, like, well then what do you do?

BAQUET When I heard this latest album, and then I thought about the earlier albums, one theme was sort of reaching the promised land. You know, you've acquired influence, and not just money, but your life is good. And then when you listen to the newest album, you're thinking: He must have been in a lot of pain when life was good.

JAY-Z Absolutely.

BAQUET Is that true?

JAY-Z Yeah. I did this song called ""Song Cry.""10

10Reggie Ugwu: The song, from Jay-Z’s Grammy-nominated 2001 album “ The song, from Jay-Z’s Grammy-nominated 2001 album “ The Blueprint ,” describes the dissolution of three early relationships and the rapper’s inability to reconcile his emotions and grieve fully, or openly. “Pride won’t let me show it / Pretend to be heroic.”

BAQUET Mm-hmm.

JAY-Z And the idea of the hook — ""never seen it comin' down my eyes, but I gotta make the song cry."" It tells you right there what I was, I was hiding.

The strongest thing a man can do is cry. To expose your feelings, to be vulnerable in front of the world. That’s real strength. You know, you feel like you gotta be this guarded person. That’s not real. It’s fake.

BAQUET Does that mean you were unhappy during that period and didn't have a handle on it, or what?

JAY-Z Well, you compartmentalize, right? So you can be, you can be inside your body and be happy, but at the core of it, something else is going on.

BAQUET As a parent, I thought one of the most painful scenes in the album was when you are talking about having almost lost your marriage, and what it would have been like to watch another man play football with your kid. Given that you have talked so much about your life in your music, are there things that you put a wall around? You've talked about the pain of growing up where you grew up, how you grew up, your father leaving early, the pain of your marriage, being in therapy: Are there things [about which] you say, ""I'm not going there""?

JAY-Z Yeah. And it mostly involves other people 'cause when other people are involved, you may be ready to expose these things, [but] it's also other people truth as well.

A perfect example is my mom. I didn't have permission to do that song first.11 It's just like we had a beautiful conversation.

11Wesley Morris: I'm a sucker for mommy music. The third track on ""4:44"" — ""Smile"" — features Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, and contains this couplet about her: ""Momma had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian."" His rapping here is buttery and exuberant: ""I just wanna see you smile through all the hate / Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake."" So his approach to Gloria manages to exult her and, for anybody annoyed by his ""eat the cake, Anna Mae"" line on Beyoncé's 2013 track "" I'm a sucker for mommy music. The third track on ""4:44"" — ""Smile"" — features Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, and contains this couplet about her: ""Momma had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian."" His rapping here is buttery and exuberant: ""I just wanna see you smile through all the hate / Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake."" So his approach to Gloria manages to exult her and, for anybody annoyed by his ""eat the cake, Anna Mae"" line on Beyoncé's 2013 track "" Drunk in Love ,"" arguably to exonerate him from having cast himself as Ike Turner to Beyoncé's Tina. Anyway, ""Smile"" ends with an inspirational poem that Gloria wrote and recites and that puts the concept of shadows to moving metaphorical use: ""The world is changing and they say it's time to be free / But you live with the fear of just being me / Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be / No harm for them, no harm for me / But life is short, and it's time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed / Smile.""

BAQUET When did you realize your mother was gay?

JAY-Z Uh, really early on when, when I was ...

BAQUET Like as a little kid?

JAY-Z Not, no, not — let's call it teenage years.

BAQUET So you realized that and talked to her about it?

JAY-Z We never spoke about it. We — it just exist. It was there. Everyone knew.

BAQUET Gotcha.

JAY-Z But we never spoke about it. Until, like, recently, now we start having these beautiful conversations, and just really getting to know each other. We were always good friends but now we're really great friends. You know. And we were just talking as friends. And then she was sharing that she was in love. She can be herself [now]. She doesn't have to hide for her kids or feel like she's embarrassing her kids. It was a much different time then. [Now] she can just live her full life, her whole life, and be her.

BAQUET Will this get harder over time? Like, you know, as a young man, your music was the way a lot of young rappers are — it's like, you know, [your music was about] the violent life. If that's chapter one of the autobiography, chapter two of the autobiography — I'm oversimplifying — is like, ""Now I'm really rich. I have a lot of stuff. Let me tell you how cool that is."" And then chapter three of the autobiography is, ""Oh my god, I've run myself into the ground."" So what's chapter four?

JAY-Z No, chapter three is: Oh my goodness, oh, the most beautiful things are not these objects. The most beautiful things are inside. The most beautiful things are the friendships I have. I have really golden friendships. The compassion and the person I've become — that's what this chapter is. You know? And the conversation with my mom. Those are the real enriching experiences.

BAQUET But will you have the same adventures in your life? Will you have the same stuff to write about? Or maybe you don't know.

JAY-Z I think that rap in particular is a young man's sport, that I'll move out of that white-hot space. Rap is about the gift of discovery. The white-hot space is when it's fresh and new, and it's like, this is the hottest song ever. I mean I pushed the window, like —

BAQUET You still — you think you're still in that space?

JAY-Z I stretched it. Oh, I stood in that window a really long time. But still, no, I don't think people are looking to me as like, The Thing.

BAQUET Is that hard to deal with, or did you feel like, I'm O.K. with that, because I've moved on?

JAY-Z No.

BAQUET You don't want to be.

JAY-Z 'Cause I, at the end of the day we gonna find out it's not about the white-hot space, but it's about finding the truth. That white-hot space — people think it's the biggest thing, but it's really small. It's almost like a trend.

Would you rather be a trend, or you rather be Ralph Lauren? You know what I mean; like, you rather be a trend, or you rather be forever?

I’m the person that looked at the Mona Lisa and be like, Man, that’s gonna be cool in 40 years. I play forever. And so my whole thing is to identify with the truth. Not to be the youngest, hottest, new, trendy thing.

BAQUET One of the things you rap about also is the pain you caused the people you sold drugs to.12 Have you ever had conversations with people like that you caused pain to as a young man and talked about it?

12Reggie Ugwu: A motif of Jay-Z's discography is the mutually assured destruction of drug users and drug dealers alike. From "" A motif of Jay-Z's discography is the mutually assured destruction of drug users and drug dealers alike. From "" Can I Live "" on 1996's "" Reasonable Doubt "": ""We hustle out of a sense of hopelessness ... We become addicted / Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'.""

JAY-Z No, I haven't. No.

BAQUET What would you say to them? Or is that impossible to do at this point?

JAY-Z Nothing's impossible. I guess that conversation would definitely take ownership for my part in, um, you know, the part I played in occupying that space. Because knowing what I know now, you know, you can't sacrifice others for your life. There's a karmic debt that has to be paid. Had I had the level of consciousness then that I have now, things would have turned out differently. And just knowing that ... I definitely want everyone to know that.

BAQUET Do black artists have a different obligation than white artists? Do you feel you have a different kind of obligation to the people who listen to you than if you were a white musician?

JAY-Z Yeah, 'cause I have an obligation, going back to the story of O.J., to further conversation of an entire race of people. And to . . . Not me — all of us. But specifically me, since you're asking the question, it's to open up dialogue. [...] It's O.K. to think. It's O.K. to be smart. You know, there was a time when people was like, ""you talkin' white."" It's like, what does that even mean? I know words? Intelligence is not a tribute to color. And I'm sure you've heard it growing up many times.

BAQUET Of course.

JAY-Z ""You speaking white."" Like, what?

BAQUET Yeah. Yeah.

JAY-Z I'm speaking like I know words. And it's O.K., it's fine. You know, so I have an obligation to further the conversation and always, you know, our stature in America. Our emotional maturity. And so on and so forth. It's humbling; at the same time it's like, you know, it's what you've been charged with in life. And I believe since the beginning of time the poets have been charged with that. Like it was the poets that's explaining the emotions and making these songs that people like, ""Oh, that's what I feel.""

BAQUET Are there black artists, and I won't ask you to name them unless you want to, who you think don't live up to that obligation to start a conversation about race? Do you think there are people you wish did more?

JAY-Z Well, I mean, and for one, O.J., right? 'Cause that's the one that we can all identify. There are those who don't uphold their mantle, and we know how that story plays out.

BAQUET What would you say to him if you could talk to him?

JAY-Z I don't know. I would probably say, ""Man, I'm sorry that so much happened to you, man."" You know, people act out in this way based on their life experiences and, you know, I'm sure he's been through a lot of trauma in his life. I think that'll start the conversation.

BAQUET Did you watch the documentary about him?

JAY-Z I watched every one.

BAQUET I did too.

JAY-Z Yeah, there was like eight of them on at the same time.

BAQUET You could read the story of O.J. two ways. You could say it's a reminder of people that they're black. I could read that as a negative message or a positive message. The positive message being: You're black and you should be more proud of it. The negative message is: Who are you kidding? You can't escape this by joining a private country club and playing golf.

JAY-Z Right.

BAQUET Which message feels like the right [one]?

JAY-Z They both, they both dual messages at the same time. It's like, be proud of who you are and realize that we're gonna get further together. Don't check out. You can't just turn your back on the place you come from. You come from a community. Your job is to uplift it now.

BAQUET So now I gotta ask my one gossipy question. Talk about Kanye West and your relationship with him, which you alluded to a little bit in the album.13 When's the last time you talked to him?

13Wesley Morris: It's an allusion to a saga. Together, Jay-Z and Kanye West made the 2011 album ""Watch the Throne,"" which reached an apogee of rap collaboration. The story goes that last year, Jay-Z, through his partnership with Live Nation, gave West $20 million as part of his contract to cover expenses for his Saint Pablo tour. Then, from the stage of that tour in Sacramento, West embarked on a tirade that included shots at, among others, Beyoncé, Mark Zuckerberg and, yes, Jay-Z: ""I've been sent here to give y'all my truth even at the risk of my own life, even at the risk of my own success, my own career. ... Jay-Z — call me, brah. You still ain't called me. ... Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send 'em at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man."" He eventually ended the concert after four songs and, two days later, It's an allusion to a saga. Together, Jay-Z and Kanye West made the 2011 album ""Watch the Throne,"" which reached an apogee of rap collaboration. The story goes that last year, Jay-Z, through his partnership with Live Nation, gave West $20 million as part of his contract to cover expenses for his Saint Pablo tour. Then, from the stage of that tour in Sacramento, West embarked on a tirade that included shots at, among others, Beyoncé, Mark Zuckerberg and, yes, Jay-Z: ""I've been sent here to give y'all my truth even at the risk of my own life, even at the risk of my own success, my own career. ... Jay-Z — call me, brah. You still ain't called me. ... Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send 'em at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man."" He eventually ended the concert after four songs and, two days later, checked himself into a hospital for an eight-day stay. So, in response, Jay-Z opens ""4:44"" with "" Kill Jay-Z ,"" nearly three minutes of second-person self-laceration. ""You ain't a saint / This ain't KumbaYe,"" Jay-Z raps. ""But you got hurt because you did cool by Ye / You gave him $20 without blinking / He gave you 20 minutes on stage / [What] was he thinkin'?"" I've been interpreting this as Jay-Z realizing the usefulness of the old business credo advising against mixing business with friendship and blaming himself for ignoring it.

JAY-Z I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he's my brother. I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated relationship with us.

BAQUET Why is it complicated?

JAY-Z 'Cause, you know — Kanye came into this business on my label. So I've always been like his big brother. And we're both entertainers. It's always been like a little underlying competition with your big brother. And we both love and respect each other's art, too. So it's like, we both — everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You know what I'm saying? And then there's like a lot of other factors that play in it. But it's gonna, we gonna always be good.

BAQUET But there's tension now, right?

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that happens. In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I'm saying? There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ""These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel."" I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. You know what I'm saying? These are — I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.

BAQUET Is he as evolved as you?

JAY-Z He's highly evolved. No, he's ... I think he started out in a more compassionate position than me. You know what I'm saying. I don't know if he's had the level of — I mean, I had to survive by my instincts. I'm here because I grew up a different way. And I got out of that.

You know, my first album came out when I was 26. So I was already a different artist. You know, a lot of people's album come out they're 17, 18. So their subject matter is that of a 17- or 18-year-old. Unless you're Nas, and you like, well-read14... — like, he was way more advanced with the album that he wrote. So I just grew up a different way. But [West is] a very compassionate person. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others. So I can identify with it. It's just that there's certain things that happened that's not really acceptable to me.

14Reggie Ugwu: Recorded when he was still a teenager, Nas's landmark 1994 debut album, ""Illmatic,"" was praised for its vivid, incisive lyrics about coming of age among urban blight. A Queens native and autodidact, he dropped out of school after the eighth grade.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z And we just need to speak about it. But there's genuine love there.

BAQUET I'm trying to picture the scene when you and your wife both talked about making these very confessional, open albums. Was it difficult to say: ""I'm gonna talk about the problems in our marriage. I'm gonna talk about how we almost lost things."" And for her to say: ""I'm gonna talk about my pain and anger at you."" What were those conversations like?

JAY-Z Again, it didn't — it didn't happen in that way. It happened — we were using our art almost like a therapy session. And we started making music together.

And then the music she was making at that time was further along. So her album came out as opposed to the joint album that we were working on. Um, we still have a lot of that music. And this is what it became. There was never a point where it was like, “I’m making this album.” I was right there the entire time.

BAQUET And what was her reaction to your work and what was your reaction to hers? They must have caused pain for each of you, right?

JAY-Z Of course. And both very, very uncomfortable, but [...] the best place in the, you know, hurricane is like in the middle of it.

BAQUET Yeah.

JAY-Z We were sitting in the eye of that hurricane. Uh, maybe not use hurricane because so many people are being affected right now. [This interview took place nine days after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, on the heels of two other devastating hurricanes, Irma and Harvey, that struck the U.S. mainland.]

BAQUET Yeah.

JAY-Z But the best place is right in the middle of the pain.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z And that's where we were sitting. And it was uncomfortable. And we had a lot of conversations. You know. [I was] really proud of the music she made, and she was really proud of the art I released. And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a healthy respect for one another's craft. I think she's amazing.

You know, most people walk away, and like divorce rate is like 50 percent or something ’cause most people can’t see themselves. The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone’s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself.

BAQUET Yeah.

JAY-Z So, you know, most people don't want to do that. You don't want to look inside yourself.

And no longer were the psychological ripples from such an attack — the eyeing of fellow subway riders, the suspicion that anyone could turn a train car into a death trap — confined to regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Europe, where citizens are returning home in large numbers from terrorism hotbeds like Iraq and Syria.

With the Islamic State shedding territory overseas and fighters frustrated at the prospect of reaching the battlefield abroad, once-unthinkable tactics have made an appearance in New York, too.

“It’s scarier, because you don’t even know,” Fabian Fanfair, a United Parcel Service supervisor from Brooklyn, said on Monday. “Somebody having that on him, you don’t know who it could be. I could be just sitting on the train taking a nap like I usually do, and something like that could just happen.”

Suicide bombings are exceedingly difficult for the police to stop once they have been set into motion, and the attack left counterterrorism experts reckoning with how guerrilla tactics recently adopted by the Islamic State as it faces losses abroad could be countered.

“Old tactics, they never really come off the table,” said David C. Kelly, a former assistant commissioner for counterterrorism in the New York Police Department. “It’s probably one of the toughest attack methods to detect and prevent.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Kelly said, police officials started working up a list of contingencies, and a scenario like Monday’s attack was near the top of the list. Investigators held tabletop exercises to formulate, among other things, how investigators would sweep the subway system afterward for additional explosives.

But Lisa O. Monaco, a former Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser with the Obama administration, said that the counterterrorism architecture created after the Sept. 11 attacks was intended to protect against well-organized groups like Al Qaeda, not a kind of lone-wolf attacker like Mr. Ullah.

“If they’re determined to die in the process of the attack, you are much less likely to detect planning of follow on travel or attempts to escape,” said Ms. Monaco, who is now a distinguished senior fellow at the New York University Law School.

In 2009, the government foiled a planned suicide attack. Najibullah Zazi and two friends were accused of planning to strap explosives to themselves, split up and board packed trains from the Grand Central and Times Square stations at rush hour. Mr. Zazi realized that he was under government surveillance and later pleaded guilty to what officials described as a Qaeda plot.

The police broke up another suspected suicide attack in 1997 when officers found the makings of pipe bombs in a Brooklyn apartment.

Other plots, though crude, leave telltale signs that something is amiss, like the car bomb in Times Square in 2010 that prompted an evacuation after a sidewalk vendor noticed smoke coming out of vents in the car.

The truck attack in Lower Manhattan on Halloween was also reminiscent of a tactic more prevalent overseas.

Officials have puzzled over why more attackers have not tried to commit suicide bombings in the United States. Mr. Kelly, now an associate managing director at K2 Intelligence, which offers investigative and consulting services, said officials wondered if domestic terrorists were trying to compensate for their smaller numbers by preserving themselves for future attacks.

Jean-Charles Brisard, chairman of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, a research organization in Paris, said the United States, unlike Europe, also had fewer citizens returning from terrorism hot spots abroad.

“The United States was not as impacted by the jihadi phenomenon,” he said.

But he said Islamic State strategy has changed as it loses its geographic foothold in Iraq and Syria. As part of its effort to stay relevant, it has increasingly directed its supporters to carry out attacks in New York City.

He pointed to accounts on the encrypted chat service Telegram, known for disseminating jihadi propaganda, which in recent weeks has published apocalyptic images of the New York City skyline in flames. One, which depicts a camouflaged fighter holding a black ISIS flag, included the caption “Very soon we’ll be the one who will fight you, and you’ll fight us no more.”

With the United States choking off people’s efforts to get weapons training overseas, and also making it difficult for foreign fighters to enter the country, Islamic State supporters in the New York area and around the world are turning to tutorials on encrypted communications channels.

“Even someone who has never dealt with chemistry or bomb making could be able to make a sophisticated device,” Mr. Brisard said.

In the past such attacks have prompted many countries, including the United States and more recently France, to expand government surveillance and impose certain restrictions in the name of security. After subway and bus blasts tore through London in 2005, for example, the police in New York started inspecting some bags coming into the subway system as a deterrent.

But countering suicide attacks can be a challenge even in countries with weak civil rights protections and expansive law enforcement powers.

Russia, where suicide bombings are not uncommon, particularly on public transportation, has responded — mostly in vain — with a grab bag of heavy-handed tactics. After a suicide bomber killed 16 people in an attack on the St. Petersburg Metro in April, two suspected accomplices who had their citizenship revoked said the police had beaten and waterboarded them, according to Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit.

Such attacks typically result in the increased use of racial profiling by law enforcement on public transportation, said Tanya Lokshina, the Russia program director for Human Rights Watch in Moscow. “We can only hope the U.S. authorities do not react in a similar manner,” she said.

After the attack on Monday, some New Yorkers remained sanguine. They said the goal of a suicide bombing was no different from that of the Chelsea bombing last year or the truck attack on Halloween: to scare people. They said they would keep going about their routines.

“We’re not surprised because we’ve had everything else,” said Stella Pulo, a Manhattan resident. “A bit of complacency has set in that this is now the norm.

We say, ‘Be safe.’”",Port Authority Subway Bomber Imports a Tactic From Overseas,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/port-authority-subway-bomber-imports-a-tactic-from-overseas.html

Sexual Harassment Training Doesn’t Work. But Some Things Do. Traditional methods can backfire, but ideas like teaching bystanders to intervene and promoting more women have proved effective. Image Credit Lorraine Sorlet

Many people are familiar with typical corporate sexual harassment training: clicking through a PowerPoint, checking a box that you read the employee handbook or attending a mandatory seminar at which someone lectures about harassment while attendees glance at their phones.

At best, research has found, that type of training succeeds in teaching people basic information, like the definition of harassment and how to report violations. At worst, it can make them uncomfortable, prompting defensive jo kes, or reinforce gender stereotypes, potentially making harassment worse. Either way, it usually fails to address the root problem: preventing sexual harassment from happening in the first place.

That’s because much of the training exists for a different reason altogether. Two 1998 Supreme Court cases determined that for a company to avoid liability in a sexual harassment case, it had to show that it had trained employees on its anti-harassment policies.

But while training protects companies from lawsuits, it can also backfire by reinforcing gender stereotypes, at least in the short term, according to research by Justine Tinkler, a sociologist at the University of Georgia. That’s because it tends to portray men as powerful and sexually insatiable and women as vulnerable. Her research has shown this effect no matter how minimal the training. “It puts women in a difficult position in terms of feeling confident and empowered in the workplace,” she said.

Other research found that training that described people in a legal context, as harassers or victims, led those being trained to reject it as a waste of time because they didn’t think the labels applied to them, known as an “identity threat reaction,” said Shannon Rawski, a professor of business at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh. Training was least effective with people who equated masculinity with power. “In other words, the men who were probably more likely to be harassers were the ones who were least likely to benefit,” said Eden King, a psychologist at Rice University.

Training is essential but not enough, researchers say. To actually prevent harassment, companies need to create a culture in which women are treated as equals and employees treat one another with respect.

“Organizations often implement training programs in order to reduce their likelihood of being named in harassment suits or to check a box for E.E.O.C. purposes,” Ms. King said, referring to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “If we’re actually trying to change or reduce the likelihood of sexual harassment, that’s a different outcome altogether. That’s not a knowledge problem, that’s a behavior problem.”

Here are evidence-based ideas for how to create a workplace culture that rejects harassment. Researchers say they apply not just to men attacking women but to other types of harassment, too.

Empower the Bystander

This equips everyone in the workplace to stop harassment, instead of offering people two roles no one wants: harasser or victim, Ms. Rawski said. Bystander training is still rare in corporate America but has been effectively used on college campuses, in the military and by nonprofits.

One study found that soldiers who received the training were significantly more likely than those who did not to report having taken action when they saw assault or harassment. Another found that it changed college students’ attitudes regarding sexual violence and individuals’ ability to stop it, a change measurable both immediately after the training and a year later.

Trainers suggest choices for what to do as a bystander. Most don’t advise confronting the harasser in the moment, because it can escalate and put the bystander in jeopardy. If comfortable doing so, they suggest, a bystander can say something like, “That joke wasn’t funny.”

Another option is to disrupt the situation, such as by loudly dropping a book or asking the victim to come to the conference room. (Charles Sonder, referred to as Snackman in a widely shared video, defused a fight on the subway by standing between the combatants, eating chips.)

Observers can talk to the harasser later, by asking questions but not lobbing accusations: “Were you aware of how you came off in that conversation?” Researchers also suggest talking openly about inappropriate behavior, like asking colleagues: “Did you notice that? Am I the only one who sees it this way?”

One crucial element, researchers say, is for bystanders to talk to targets of harassment. They often feel isolated, and observers might not know if they thought the interaction was consensual or amusing. Colleagues could say: “I noticed that happened. Are you O.K. with that?” If not, they could offer to accompany the victim to the human resources department.

“So many victims blame themselves, so a bystander saying, ‘This isn’t your fault, you didn’t do anything wrong,’ is really, really important,” said Sharyn Potter, a sociologist at the University of New Hampshire who runs a research group there for sexual violence prevention.

Bystanders are unlikely to be present when the most egregious offenses happen, but harassers often test how far they can go by starting with inappropriate comments or touches, said Robert Eckstein, the lead trainer at the research group. A good workplace culture stops them before the offenses get worse.

“Bystander intervention is not about putting on your cape and saving the day,” he said. “It’s about having a conversation with a friend about the way they talk about women.”

Encourage Civility

One problem with traditional training, researchers say, is that it teaches people what not to do — but is silent on what they should do. Civility training aims to fill that gap.

Fran Sepler, who designed new training programs for the E.E.O.C., starts by asking participants to brainstorm a list of respectful behaviors. These often sound trivial, she said, but aren’t common enough, like praising work, refraining from interrupting and avoiding multitasking during conversations. A big one is spotlighting contributions by people who are marginalized. A person could say: “She just raised that same idea. Would she like to expand on it?”

Image Credit Lorraine Sorlet

Ms. Sepler gives people scripts for how to give and receive constructive feedback about rude behavior, so it can be dealt with in the moment. She teaches supervisors how to listen to complaints without being dismissive.

Train Seriously and Often

The most effective training, researchers say, is at least four hours, in person, interactive and tailored for the particular workplace — a restaurant’s training would differ from a law firm’s. It’s best if done by the employees’ supervisor or an external expert (not an H.R. official with no direct oversight).

It also seems to help if white men are involved in the training. A recent paper found that women and minorities are penalized in performance reviews for supporting diversity, while white men are taken more seriously when they do it. Another found a backlash against training when it was done by a woman but not a man.

Training shouldn’t be infrequent, and the topic should come up in conversations about other things, whether strategy or customer service, said KC Wagner, a harassment prevention trainer at Cornell’s ILR School.

“We’re talking about literally generations of people getting away with abusing power,” Mr. Eckstein said. “Thinking you can change that in a one-hour session is absurd. You’re not going to just order some bagels and hope it goes away.”

Promote More Women

Research has continually shown that companies with more women in management have less sexual harassment. It’s partly because harassment flourishes when men are in power and women aren’t, and men feel pressure to accept other men’s sexualized behavior.

It also helps to reduce gender inequality in other ways, research shows, like paying and promoting men and women equally, and including both sexes on teams.

Encourage Reporting

Most women don’t report harassment. Some don’t want to take the risk alone; fear retaliation; don’t know whom to report it to; or don’t think anything will be done. They may not want to end someone’s career — they just want to stop the behavior.

Image Credit Lorraine Sorlet

The E.E.O.C. has suggested a counterintuitive idea: Reward managers if harassment complaints increase, at least initially, in their departments — that means employees have faith in the system. It also recommended giving dozens of people in the organization responsibility for receiving reports, to increase the odds that victims can talk to someone they’re comfortable with.

Ian Ayres, a Yale professor of law and management, has written about using so-called information escrows for harassment reporting. Victims submit a time-stamped complaint against an abuser, and can request that it is reported only if another employee files a complaint against the same person.

Researchers also suggested proportional consequences: Harassers shouldn’t be automatically fired; it should depend on the offense.

“If the penalty is someone’s always going to get fired, lots of targets won’t come forward,” Ms. Rawski said. “But research suggests if you let the small things slide, it opens the door for more severe behaviors to enter the workplace .”

New Yorkers are not known for collectively possessing a stiff upper lip. Complaining about life’s indignities tends to be a default position. But there is a notable exception, and it was amply displayed on Monday after an explosion in a busy transit corridor at Times Square. At such moments New York embodies the classic British slogan of World War II vintage: Keep calm and carry on.

The city barely blinked after the morning rush-hour blast, which officials described as a failed attempt at terrorism by an immigrant from Bangladesh who had strapped a pipe bomb to his body. He ended up wounding himself seriously and inflicting minor injuries on three others. No doubt, the communal reaction would have been more frantic had the toll been higher. But the normal rhythms of the city paused only briefly. New Yorkers have become quite adept at keeping their composure.

Partly that’s because they have no other choice. They know their city is destined to be in the cross hairs of assorted madmen responding to religious and political commands or simply to the demons rattling in their heads. It has long been thus.

A century ago, New York was a favored target for self-described anarchists. In 1920, a bomb planted in a horse-drawn wagon exploded outside the J. P. Morgan bank on Wall Street, killing more than 30 people. Back then, it was America’s most devastating act of terrorism. New York in the 1970s endured a series of deadly attacks by Croatian, Puerto Rican and anti-Castro Cuban nationalists. Now the concern is terrorism perpetrated primarily by Islamist radicals, like the horror on Halloween when an Uzbek immigrant drove a pickup truck along a bike path in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 12 others.

In the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department has worked hard to keep the city safe. But it can’t head off every attack, especially one like Monday’s, committed apparently by a lone wolf possibly inspired by the Islamic State. Nor is President Trump’s ban on travelers from eight countries, six of them predominantly Muslim, any help. None of the men accused of the most recent assaults in New York and elsewhere in the United States came from those countries. The far greater threat comes from disaffected homegrown terrorists with ready access to handguns and rifles.

TH: O.K., so the tablecloth will be fine, but what if someone spills wine on what he or she is wearing?

JK: The Wine Away will work, but if you don’t have any on hand, flushing the stained part of the clothing with cold running water will at least help to push out a lot of the stain. If you can add some suds to the party, massaging a small amount of dish or hand soap into the stain while flushing it with the water will be even better. If you can’t get to a sink, or just don’t want to walk around with a wet shirt, Shout Wipes are excellent and super easy to stash in a wallet or purse.

TH: Now moving to eating from drinking: What should I do about all of the inevitable grease and gravy stains I’m going to cover myself in?

JK: There are basically two ways you can go with greasy, oily stains: Dab a liquid degreasing product, such as Pine Sol, Lestoil or CitraSolv, on launderable items, or cornstarch for things that can’t go in the wash. (The degreasers can also be used on pots, pans and kitchen surfaces that have gotten splatter-y.) Cornstarch works on grease in much the same way that salt works on red wine: It will absorb it up out of textiles like tablecloths or cashmere sweaters. Lay whatever has gotten greasy on a flat surface, pile the cornstarch on the stain, and let it sit, undisturbed, for 12 to 24 hours before brushing away.

TH: So tomorrow is the first night of Hanukkah. Any specific spill and stain advice for those celebrating?

JK: That grease stain advice will be crucial for those on latke-frying duty. Also, Hanukkah gelt is super delicious, but it also gets melt-y very quickly, which means lots of little chocolate-y fingerprints tend to get on clothes and upholstered furniture. So here’s a quick tip: Shout laundry pretreatment spray is excellent on chocolate stains. Spray the Shout onto the stained fabric and work it in using a damp light-colored rag or sponge — the chocolate will come right out.

TH: What other tips or tricks for the holiday party season can you give us?

JK: If I had to tell people to carry just one thing with them to handle stains on the fly, it would be hand sanitizer. Weird but true. It has a high concentration of alcohol in it, which is a very good stain remover and will work on everything from pen to food spills to blood. Not that you’d need to get blood stains out of anything during the holidays, of course.

TH: Stain-cleanup lightning round: Wax?

JK: Hairdryer to melt, then wipe it up with paper towels.

TH: Lipstick?

JK: Rubbing alcohol, or that hand sanitizer trick I mentioned.

TH: Coffee?

JK: Flush with water and massage a tiny amount of dish soap into the stain, or use a Shout Wipe.

TH: And last: Blood?

JK: Let them bleed out.

TH: O.M.G. Jolie no!

JK: O.K. fine, hydrogen peroxide.

TH: Thank you so much for chatting with me! Any parting words of advice for living clean in 2018, physically or spiritually?

JK: Most people think of cleaning as something they have to do because someone else says so, or shames them into it. If you can flip the script on yourself and think about taking care of your things and your home as a gift you give to yourself, it will make cleaning feel less gruesome and sloggy. And make your bed every day!

For even more, listen to Jolie’s podcast Ask a Clean Person, where she and I recently talked about tackling the holiday’s toughest messes.

With the war in Afghanistan now in its 17th year, President Trump’s strategy aims to drive the Taliban to a negotiated settlement. It seeks not only to squeeze the group’s opium revenues, but also to increase Afghan army offensives backed by American air power and to hold elections to enhance the Afghan government’s legitimacy.

“The Taliban have three choices: reconcile, face irrelevance or die,” General Nicholson said.

Afghanistan specialists say they have heard such boasts before, and the war is still being fought. They also voiced doubts about the hit-them-in-the-pocketbook plan.

“It’s useful to impact the Taliban financially, but it may just drive production into neighboring Pakistan or Iran,” said David W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general who led the war effort in Afghanistan for almost two years.

Other critics said the sharp increase in airstrikes will backfire, inevitably causing more civilian casualties and the accompanying political blowback, despite the military’s best efforts to mitigate that risk.

“If you increase the number of strikes without allocating the time, personnel and resources to preventing, investigating and acknowledging each one, you get more civilian casualties,” said Daniel R. Mahanty, United States program director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an advocacy group. “It’s basic math.”

Targeting specialists at the military’s air command center in Qatar say they assembled the list of drug facilities that directly finance Taliban insurgents battling the government by examining hundreds of hours of aerial surveillance and poring over intelligence reports. Airstrikes have been carried out at night when fewer people are near the targets.

“It was a very deliberate process,” said Capt. Ryan Pretty, an Army artillery officer who is deputy chief of the team overseeing the bombing campaign’s effects.

Watching and eavesdropping on the scurrying around by drug lab operators whose depots were not hit in the first wave offered important insights for planners drawing up the next set of strikes, helping them map out local Taliban networks.

“These strikes and the aftermath taught us a lot about the complexity of the Taliban’s narcotics operations,” said Navy Lt. William Conway, a former prosecutor in Chicago who is now a lead intelligence officer for Afghanistan at the command center in Qatar.

Central to both the antidrug and troop-protection operations are the B-52’s. They are the latest chapter in the storied bomber’s history over the past six decades, from its carpet-bombing missions in the Vietnam and 1991 Persian Gulf wars, to its strategic role as part of the country’s nuclear deterrent. In January, B-52’s will deploy from Louisiana to Guam for duty in the Pacific, including near North Korea.

Of the roughly 750 B-52’s originally built, the Air Force is still flying about 75 of the sweptwing, eight-engine H-model planes. The aircraft I flew on, nicknamed Night Train, was built in 1961, making it nearly twice as old as any of its five crew members from the 69th Bomb Squadron out of Minot Air Base, N.D.

Our mission began before 5 a.m. at the squadron headquarters at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where the crew received a series of intelligence, safety and mission briefings. Following bomber tradition, the crew then sprayed on cologne (a very pungent “Extreme Liberty” for this mission).

In the pre-dawn darkness, a bus ferried the crew to its jet, its engines running, bombs hanging off its massive wings. Crew members clambered up a metal ladder into the fuselage. The two weapons officers — Soar, 30, from Pittsburgh, and Will, 28, from Arcadia, Calif. — sat in front of glowing screens in the cramped, windowless offensive operations compartment.

Up another metal ladder was the cockpit and a separate cramped, windowless space for the electronic warfare officer — Poppa, 28, from San Diego. The mission commander, Rage, 29, from Minden, Neb., and his co-pilot, Bravo, 26, from Hillsborough, N.J., ducked down an aisle and shoehorned themselves into their seats in the cockpit, while strapped into oxygen masks, flight suits, flight vests and ejection seats with parachutes. I sat in an instructor pilot seat behind Rage.

The crew members asked to be identified only by their call signs or first names for security reasons. It is a young crew, with only one member, Soar, having previously deployed overseas. One of a dozen crews in the squadron, this was their 23rd mission to Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria since arriving in September.

At 5:41 a.m., with the reddish dawn seeping across the horizon, the B-52 lumbered down the runway and roared off on the 3 and a half-hour flight to southern Nangahar Province in eastern Afghanistan, where Taliban and Islamic State fighters are battling with Afghan army troops for control.

Once there, with jaw-dropping views of 16,000-foot, snow-capped peaks out the tiny cockpit windows, the crew received instructions from Special Operations forces working with Afghan troops on the ground to use their high-powered camera sensors to spy on several buildings in a village compound, and look for any “nefarious” activity.

In this case, the B-52 was acting as an airborne cavalry, ready to rush to the aid of friendly forces with a formidable arsenal that included about two dozen 2,000-pound and 500-pound laser-guided bombs — more than 10 tons of destruction in all.

Inside the B-52, affectionately known as a Buff (as in “Big, Ugly, Fat,” followed by an expletive), the noise was deafening. Crew members wore headphones and talked over microphones. Thirteen hours is a long time in a very confined space, and the crew has tricks to stay alert, including energy drinks and lots of caffeine. An eclectic mix of heavy metal, rock, country and rap music blared through their headphones.

For six hours, the B-52 flew tightly banked routes to give Soar the best view of his potential targets. Black-and-white images flickered across his screen: A man chopping wood. A woman doing laundry. Suddenly, he spotted something suspicious: a man pulling a long cylindrical object out from under a tarp. Was it just a long piece of wood or pipe, or was it a surface-to-air missile?

Taking no chances, Rage and Bravo veered the plane out of missile range, and called for an armed Reaper drone nearby to take a closer look. After nearly an hour and some delays, the B-52 needed to turn back to base without resolving the minor mystery.

No bombs were dropped that day, as has been the case on about a quarter of the crew’s so-called overwatch missions to protect Afghan troops. “But the good guys got home safely,” said Rage.","Hunting Taliban and Islamic State Fighters, From 20,000 Feet",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/asia/taliban-isis-afghanistan-drugs-b52s.html

By Monday afternoon, both the Instagram account and a GoFundMe campaign that it had linked to had been deleted. A GoFundMe spokesman, Bobby Whithorne, said the campaign had been removed before any money was collected because “the identity of the campaign organizer did not match anyone associated with the family.”

Another GoFundMe campaign, started by a person named Joseph Lam, raised more than $58,000 in two days, but Mr. Lam acknowledged that he had no connection to the family; he wrote in the campaign’s description that he simply “came across” Ms. Jones’s video on Facebook and “felt compelled to help.” On Monday, he suspended the campaign.

Asked whether GoFundMe had verified that the funds already collected would go to Keaton, Mr. Whithorne said the company was working with Mr. Lam to ensure that.

“When a stranger starts a campaign and does not have a direct connection to the individual they’re raising money for, funds are collected by our payment processors, held, and then only released only to the person named as the beneficiary,” he wrote in an email. “All funds are on hold until we’ve received additional information from the beneficiary of the campaign.”

Public attention to bullying tends to come in waves, surging around cases like Keaton’s before falling off again. In some well-publicized cases in recent years, bullying has been so vicious that victims have killed themselves.

Multiple studies, including a 2008 review by researchers at Yale and another published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2014, have found a connection between bullying and suicide.

The China Mobile document said that a manager of the company inspected five sites on Dec. 2 at the request of the Changbai County government.

The areas designated for the refugee camps were on state-owned land, and temporary housing had already been constructed at several sites, according to a local businessman who requested anonymity for fear of angering the local government.

Three county villages were named in the document as locations for the camps. The cities of Tumen and Hunchun will also house refugees, according to the businessman.

Tumen and Hunchun have for 20 years received defectors, who have managed to escape from North Korea into China. Many of those defectors travel on to Southeast Asia and eventually to South Korea.

Jilin Province is about 60 miles from Punggye-ri, the main North Korean nuclear test site. Fears of a nuclear war, or disaster, just miles away have set residents of the province on edge.

Last week, the Jilin Daily, a provincial newspaper, advised residents on how to react in case of a nuclear explosion or radioactive fallout.

The advice included washing off radioactive dust from exposed body parts and shoes, and taking iodine tablets. The article noted that when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, more than 70,000 people were killed. Modern weapons are many times more powerful.

China has refrained from imposing overly punitive sanctions on North Korea for fear of causing a collapse that would result in refugees flooding the economically vulnerable northeast. So far, China has resisted calls to cut off oil to North Korea, a move that would result in severe deprivation resulting in many people crossing the border.

Although China does not appear to have changed its basic position on maintaining stability, the increasingly hostile talk in Washington appears to be spurring contingency preparations.

Zheng Zeguang, the vice minister of foreign affairs, rushed to Washington last week to discuss what Chinese officials call the “black hole of confrontation” between the United States and North Korea.

As a result of the rising tensions, one of China’s most prominent experts on North Korea, called building the camps “absolutely reasonable.”

“It is highly possible that there is a conflict between North Korea and the United States now,” said Zhang Liangui, a professor of international strategic research at the Communist Party’s Central Party School. “What China does here is to be prepared for any kind of situation happening on the Korean Peninsula.”

In another sign of increased tensions, South Korea said on Monday that it would join the United States and Japan for a drill to practice tracking missiles launched from North Korean submarines.

Last month, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that flew higher and longer than its previous tests. The North said that the missile could deliver nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental United States.","Fearing the Worst, China Plans Refugee Camps on North Korean Border",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/asia/china-north-korea-border.html

Keeping track of dolphins is a slippery, patchy process. First, you must procure time on a ship or aircraft, which is expensive. After that, what you see depends on uncontrollable factors like weather, ocean conditions and whether the creatures happen to be hanging out at the sea’s surface.

As an alternative, researchers have tried deploying underwater sensors to eavesdrop on the clicks dolphins use for echolocation, which can give clues about the aquatic mammals’ numbers, distributions and behaviors. Sifting through all these data, however, becomes a new headache.

A machine learning program — similar to the one that recommends new Facebook friends to you — may be able to help. In a study published Thursday in PLOS Computational Biology, scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California introduced an algorithm that was able to analyze 52 million dolphin clicks and identify seven distinct groups of sound. These click types, the authors speculate, may correspond to different kinds of dolphins.

Like many good science stories, this one was the result of grad student misery. Soon after Kait Frasier started her Ph.D. in the Whale Acoustic Lab at Scripps, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill happened. Wanting to monitor how dolphins were doing after the spill, she and colleagues placed acoustic sensors around the Gulf of Mexico. It was Dr. Frasier’s job to go through the mountains of data and identify dolphin clicks.

“I tried for many years to really wrap my head around patterns in the dolphin signals,” said Dr. Frasier, who is now an assistant project scientist at Scripps. “I could get somewhere, but it took a long time and was kind of subjective.”

The New Health Care People Don’t Take Their Pills. Only One Thing Seems to Help. High-tech approaches and “reminder” packaging don’t work well. Reducing prices does.

For all that Americans spend on prescription drugs — $425 billion last year — you’d think we’d actually take our medicine.

But one of the frustrating truths about American health care is that half or more of prescribed medication is never taken.

It’s called medication nonadherence, and it’s a well-documented and longstanding problem, particularly for patients with chronic conditions. The drugs they’re prescribed are intended to prevent costly complications, reduce hospitalization, even keep them alive. But even when the stakes are high, many patients don’t take their meds.

This seems like a problem we ought to be able to solve. It motivates high tech approaches, like digital pills that can automatically communicate to doctors that they’ve been taken.

Maybe people forget to take their meds — about 60 percent of people say as much — so we just need to remind them. Maybe people don’t understand the value of what they’re prescribed, so we just need to educate them. Maybe drug regimens are too complex, so we just need to simplify dosing.

All these methods have been tried. It’s not so clear any of them work very well.

Only one approach has repeatedly been shown to be effective: reducing the cost of medications.

First, let’s look at the research on the other methods. So-called reminder packaging — pill packaging or containers that organize drugs by single dose or day of the week — is a relatively simple idea intended to help people remember to take their prescribed dose.

A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that it was helpful in doing so, but only modestly. Surveying 12 randomized controlled trials, the authors concluded that reminder packaging increased the number of pills taken by patients by 11 percentage points. But they also found that most of the studies had significant methodological flaws, casting doubt on the findings. Other systematic reviews of reminder packaging studies also found problems with the research, like small sample sizes and short follow-up periods.

Perhaps reminder packaging is too passive, and patients need something like an alarm to alert them when they’ve missed a dose. Electronic pill monitors can do that. Some just remind patients to take their medication. More sophisticated ones alert doctors when they don’t. In 2014, a team of researchers from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School published a systematic review of such devices in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Here, too, the results are disappointing. Most studies of such devices do not detect improvement in adherence.

A recent randomized trial not included in these systematic reviews tested three dose reminder approaches for people with a chronic health condition or depression: a pill bottle with toggles for each day of the week that can be changed after each daily dose; a pill bottle cap with a digital timer displaying the time elapsed since the medication was last taken; and a pill organizer with a compartment for every day of the week. Over 50,000 subjects were assigned randomly to one of these approaches or to none, as a control.

None of the devices performed better than the control in getting patients to take their medications. One possible explanation is that forgetfulness may not be why patients don’t take their medications as prescribed. Drug costs, a wish to avoid side effects, and a desire to be less reliant on drugs are some of the other reasons patients don’t take them.

“It is also possible that for reminder devices to be effective, they need to be coupled with other adherence-improvement strategies,” said Niteesh Choudhry, lead author of the study and a physician with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

That’s why augmenting electronic monitoring with other information or assistance delivered to patients may be more successful, if more expensive. For example, one study found that the adherence of hypertensive patients increased when digital display containers were combined with a blood pressure cuff and a card for recording blood pressure. This suggests that when patients receive feedback that signals how well they are controlling their condition, they may be more willing to take their medication.

Still, it isn’t hard to find studies that show that even with considerable support, getting patients to take medications can be challenging. A Cochrane review examined randomized controlled trials of interventions — across many dimensions — to increase medication adherence. Reminder packaging and alarms were just some of the methods assessed, with approaches including patient and family education about the value of medication, and mail or telephone follow-up.

Of the 182 randomized trials reviewed, four stood out as the most methodologically sound. Among those, two increased adherence but two did not. Over all, the authors concluded that there was a lack of convincing evidence that even complex and costly interventions significantly increased patients’ compliance with drug regimens.

“A cure for nonadherence is nowhere to be seen,” they wrote. A more recent study not included in the Cochrane review found that not even providing patients with financial incentives and social support, along with pill bottles that signal when a dose should be taken, was enough to boost adherence among heart attack survivors.

So why is price so important?

When drugs cost them less, patients are more likely to fill prescriptions. Even if people have already purchased drugs, they may skip doses — or split the pills — because of concerns that they won’t be able to afford future refills. Free drugs don’t get everyone to take them, but many more do so than if they have to pay for them.

For those with certain chronic conditions, extra help in affording medications can reduce adverse events and hospitalizations — a big increase in quality of life, as well as a potential benefit to the wider health care system and the economy.

Lowering prescription drug costs has been a longstanding pursuit for many politicians, and Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act helped (although most Americans still say costs are too high). President Trump said drug companies “have been getting away with murder,” but lower drug costs have not yet been a top priority of this White House.

For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html

The Marlins warned Stanton that if he stayed, the team would be torn down around him.
“I had no feeling about trading him to the Yankees,” Jeter said.
“We wanted to get the best deal.
This was the best deal out of the three for us.","Stanton, 28, has spent all of his eight-year career so far with the Marlins, with a losing record every season and eight managers over all. When he signed his 13-year, $325 million contract, in 2014, he insisted on a full no-trade clause and the ability to opt out after the sixth season. Stanton predicted he would be traded before then, and he was.

“With the history of everything, yeah, of course,” he said. “It was in my mind and I knew I had to be prepared.”

The vision of Jeter and the principal owner, Bruce Sherman — who paid $1.2 billion for the franchise and is already seeking investors — did not persuade Stanton to trust the new Marlins leadership.

“I thought our lineup was legit and we needed help with our pitchers, and we needed to add rather than subtract,” Stanton said. “The way they wanted to go was to subtract, so I let that be known that I didn’t want to be part of another rebuild.”

Stanton told the Marlins he would accept deals to the four teams in the 2017 league championship series: the Yankees, the Houston Astros, the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Like a baseball version of Kevin Durant, Stanton preferred to join a winner, not be the piece to turn a team around.

Even so, the Marlins arranged trades with the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals, recent champions that have faded. He met with both — mainly “to learn what another organization is like,” he said — but had no intention of letting Jeter dictate his future. The Marlins warned Stanton that if he stayed, the team would be torn down around him. He called their bluff.

“You can’t say that and expect me to jump at what’s there, if that’s not the right situation for me,” Stanton said. “So it doesn’t matter what the dynamic was. You’re not going to force me to do anything.”

Jeter is not at the winter meetings even though, as a new executive, he presumably could have learned more about the business side of the industry. He said he stayed away because attending the winter meetings is the job of Michael Hill, the Marlins’ president of baseball operations.

In a conference call with reporters, Jeter stressed that he had no regrets about the process and that there was no miscommunication with Stanton. He said he told Stanton, “We can build with you or without you,” and promised to present him with the best offers the Marlins had for him, even from teams he did not prefer.

Jeter emphasized that he had initially expected to build around Stanton, because he could not assume that a player with a no-trade clause would ever be willing to leave. He also stressed that the Marlins had not reached the playoffs since 2003, leaving him no choice but to tear down the roster and replenish a barren farm system.

“What has been in place hasn’t been working, and we need to fix that,” Jeter said. “We can’t just continue to dig a bigger hole.”

In exchange for Stanton and $30 million, the Marlins acquired second baseman Starlin Castro and two prospects in the low minors: shortstop Jose Devers and pitcher Jorge Guzman, who was ranked as the Yankees’ ninth-best prospect by milb.com. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said he dealt only with Hill, and Jeter dismissed the idea that trading his franchise player to his old team might have felt strange for him.

“I had no feeling about trading him to the Yankees,” Jeter said. “We wanted to get the best deal. Contrary to what people believe, we were not stuck with this deal. This was the best deal out of the three for us. My feeling was to try to make the Miami Marlins organization better, and that was the No. 1 priority.”

Dealing from their low minors appealed to the Yankees, whose ascendance last season has restored their image as free-spending favorites. Even so, the principal owner, Hal Steinbrenner, said the Yankees’ payroll would not exceed the $197 million luxury-tax threshold.

“That’s the plan, even with him added,” Steinbrenner said. “We’re comfortably under the threshold with some more money to spend, whenever we deem we want to spend it.”

As the Yankees ponder other moves, including a possible trade for the Pittsburgh right-hander Gerrit Cole, Manager Aaron Boone named part of his coaching staff: Josh Bard as the bench coach, Phil Nevin as the third base coach and Reggie Willits as the first base coach, to join the returning pitching coach, Larry Rothschild. They could have worse decisions than when to alternate Stanton and Judge between the right field and designated hitter spots, with some left field mixed in.

“I do feel like it’s a really good problem that we have,” Boone said. “The one thing that makes it workable, too, is both Giancarlo and Aaron, the two guys that obviously play the same position, are great people, and I think are open to doing what we need to do to make this the best we can.”

When the Stanton deal came into focus late last week, Cashman called Judge and explained how the playing time might work. Judge — who has used Stanton as a role model as a baseball player with a football player’s body — did not even know who the Yankees would give up. He was sold.

“Hey, I’m pumped,” Judge said, according to Cashman. “This is exciting. If could you pull that off, that would be amazing.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle by Kevin Christian has a note on it that says that the print version has a visual element that was not able to be reproduced for the online and app versions.

The puzzle is solvable either way, but the visuals make things easier and, this being a Monday puzzle, that’s what we’re here for, right? The addition of the visuals definitely make this a Monday. Without them, you can still get the theme, but it might not grow on you, so to speak, until you get to the bottom of the puzzle.

If you would like to see the visuals, I’ve put them here.

Today’s Theme

What do the six actors in the films in Mr. Christian’s theme have in common? MULLETs! They all wore their hair in the MULLET hairstyle during the filming of the movies in the clues. (Hi, kids! Ask your folks about their “Business in the front, party in the back” hair. Demand to see photos.)

Mr. Christian, who is a very nice man, is kind enough to remind us of this embarrassing period in our lives, when so many men — and some women — wore their hair this way that is was briefly declared the state haircut of New Jersey [That’s not even remotely true. — Ed.]

That’s our theme today: Hair regret.

Tricky Clues

Honestly, I was so distracted by the MULLET flashbacks that I didn’t notice if there were any difficult clues. All I can say is, make sure you know your root beers. It comes up twice today.

Constructor Notes

The mullet is the greatest hairstyle ever invented. It is the greatest hairstyle ever invented because it makes a man look like a lion. What man wouldn’t want to look like a lion? Lions are awesome. They’re the kings of the jungle. That’s why mullets are awesome. I used to have a mullet. I’m 53 years old. That means I was born in 1964. That means I was between the ages of 16 and 26 during the 80s. Of course I rocked a mullet. In fact, I have a photo of myself from 1987 where I have a mullet and a giant ZZ Top beard. Top that. I shaved it when I returned from 4-1/2 months in Europe and had to get a real job. I remember when my mullet disappeared. It was not of my own choosing. I would go to get my hair cut, and I would say, “I want it short on the sides and long in the back.” How hard is that to understand? Not very hard. However, I noticed as the years went by, the hairstylists ignored me. They didn’t leave it long in the back. It kept getting shorter and shorter in the back. I was so sad. Perhaps the hairstylists were trying to save me from myself. On a crossword note … I have a version of this grid that has JOE DIRT and CHAPPIE across the middle instead of RAMBO. That’s one more theme answer and nine more theme letters. I went with the RAMBO version instead because it has cleaner fill. Plus, I didn’t want to lose RAMBO. Who doesn’t love Sylvester Stallone in a mullet? We all love Sylvester Stallone in a mullet. All other mullets pale in comparison.

New Yorkers are not known for collectively possessing a stiff upper lip. Complaining about life’s indignities tends to be a default position. But there is a notable exception, and it was amply displayed on Monday after an explosion in a busy transit corridor at Times Square. At such moments New York embodies the classic British slogan of World War II vintage: Keep calm and carry on.

The city barely blinked after the morning rush-hour blast, which officials described as a failed attempt at terrorism by an immigrant from Bangladesh who had strapped a pipe bomb to his body. He ended up wounding himself seriously and inflicting minor injuries on three others. No doubt, the communal reaction would have been more frantic had the toll been higher. But the normal rhythms of the city paused only briefly. New Yorkers have become quite adept at keeping their composure.

Partly that’s because they have no other choice. They know their city is destined to be in the cross hairs of assorted madmen responding to religious and political commands or simply to the demons rattling in their heads. It has long been thus.

A century ago, New York was a favored target for self-described anarchists. In 1920, a bomb planted in a horse-drawn wagon exploded outside the J. P. Morgan bank on Wall Street, killing more than 30 people. Back then, it was America’s most devastating act of terrorism. New York in the 1970s endured a series of deadly attacks by Croatian, Puerto Rican and anti-Castro Cuban nationalists. Now the concern is terrorism perpetrated primarily by Islamist radicals, like the horror on Halloween when an Uzbek immigrant drove a pickup truck along a bike path in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 12 others.

In the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department has worked hard to keep the city safe. But it can’t head off every attack, especially one like Monday’s, committed apparently by a lone wolf possibly inspired by the Islamic State. Nor is President Trump’s ban on travelers from eight countries, six of them predominantly Muslim, any help. None of the men accused of the most recent assaults in New York and elsewhere in the United States came from those countries. The far greater threat comes from disaffected homegrown terrorists with ready access to handguns and rifles.

David Adler, the founder of BizBash, which tracks trends in the event-planning industry, said exuberant merriment or worse has always been a risk at corporate holiday events. But this year, with bosses, underlings and co-workers under increased scrutiny, everyone will be on their best behavior. Still, some companies are reminding employees that an office party is governed by the decorum at work.

“This is not the year for telling your boss off,” Mr. Adler said. “You aren’t going to see people letting their hair down.”

In Los Angeles, where morale has been worsened by a spate of sexual harassment charges against big-name actors and executives, the holiday vibe is markedly low-key. Paramount Pictures’ former chairman Brad Grey, who died in May, used to hold an A-list holiday shindig to celebrate the studio’s filmmakers. One year he invited Harrison Ford, Lorne Michaels and Jack Nicholson, who gathered for cocktails and canapés in the columned loggia on his Bel Air estate, overlooking an azure pool set in an acre of rolling lawn.

Regulars included Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Few Paramount executives were invited. Neighbors and nonfamous friends didn’t come either.

Jim Gianopulos, the former Twentieth Century Fox veteran hired to replace Mr. Grey, is taking a more inclusive approach this year. He too is holding a holiday party at his home for Paramount’s filmmakers and creative colleagues. But he also invited studio executives, as well as some reporters and personal friends. “It’s a casual, low-key event,” said Chris Petrikin, a Paramount studio executive who worked with Mr. Gianopulos at Fox.

This is not to be confused, of course, with the annual Christmas party on the Paramount lot. There, a tree is lit and fake snow drifts across the lot. Mr. Grey spared no extravagance when he ran the studio. One year, the party featured a carnival theme and an indoor Ferris wheel. This year, Mr. Petrikin said, it did not.

Time Inc., once known for Christmas hoopla where convivial young editors supped on buckets of oysters and glasses brimming with champagne, has moved its party to dreary January for the second year in a row. Mr. Adler, of BizBash, said corporations are hard-pressed to cancel holiday parties outright. “It sends the wrong message about the company,” he said. “It says the company does not care about its people.”

But there are ways to edit that message. For more than a decade, HBO rented a grand ballroom at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square for a lavish holiday luncheon for its 2,500 employees. Waiters passed trays of sushi. Platters of pasta and roast chicken were laid out, alongside bountiful glasses of wine and beer. More recently, though, HBO found the event as poorly received as the first season of “Hello Ladies.” About half of its employees stayed home. Many of those who showed up didn’t stick around.

Executives surmised (perhaps wisely) the party’s meager attendance wasn’t enough to justify the $300,000 price tag. So, two years ago, HBO offered its employees an afternoon off with their co-workers to volunteer at a charity instead. Last December, staffers in New York packed 101,316 children’s meals, while others visited an art center or a pediatric hospital in Hackensack, N.J. Millennials, in particular, clamored for more. This holiday season, 95 percent of HBO employees participated in the volunteering drive.

“We read the news,” said Dennis Williams, an HBO executive who oversees the program. “People are extremely eager to be involved in social causes.”

Millennials, he said, seek to connect through experiences, whether it be in a socially conscious context, like volunteering, or a collaborative activity. “They expect the company to provide them with those kinds of experiences,” Mr. Williams said.

A less philanthropic but still debauchery-free experience can be had at Escape the Room, an interactive game site where as many as 10 people are shut in a room and have one hour to solve a puzzle. Holiday bookings are up this year, said Wyndham Manning, the manager of the company’s location in Midtown Manhattan. And many are new corporate clients, albeit smaller groups, given the size and intensity of the games.

“People view this as an alternative to traditional parties,” said Mr. Manning. Investment professionals from both KKR & Co. and JPMorgan Chase recently booked all five rooms for a single hourlong session, he said. Citibank, too, booked two sessions of three games for an evening.

Such intimate gatherings give companies what they lack otherwise during the holiday party season: control in a particularly fraught year. “We’ve always had a zero-tolerance policy” for sexual harassment, said Elizabeth Maddick, the human resources manager at PicsArt, a San Francisco company that makes an app for image editing and drawing. “We wouldn’t do anything different, except to remind people that office policy is the same for an office party.”

That said, PicsArt has decided not to hold its holiday party at the Tonga Room at the Fairmont Hotel, as it did last year. Then, the hotel partitioned off a section of the bar for PicsArt’s 40 guests. Employees came and left at will, while strangers wandered into the party looking for food and drinks. So, this year, Ms. Maddick decided to hire a yacht for a three-hour dinner cruise on the San Francisco Bay.

There will be music and cocktails. “I think it’s important to get away from the office and get to know one another,” Ms. Maddick said. Best of all, she said, she can keep tabs on everyone.

“I thought, ‘My God, how are you going to raise a child in this neighborhood with the way people are feeling about this thing?’” said Mr. Sandberg, the owner of a prosperous manufacturing company. “It just wouldn’t have been great for her.”

The Sandbergs returned the child. A few months later, they adopted a newborn white girl and named her Amy.

Even as the Sandbergs moved on, the impact of what they did lingered. Ms. Sandberg, who died of cancer in 1997, kept journal entries saying she thought about the girl every April, the month she was born. The Sandbergs eventually separated and divorced. The family almost never talked about what had happened.

But the white daughter they kept, Amy, who is now married and goes by the last name Roost, began thinking about the family secret again in 2012, after Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, was killed by a neighborhood watchman in Florida, setting off a national conversation about racial disparities in America. Ms. Roost wondered if the girl her parents had sent back had ended up on the short end of the country’s racial divide.

Ms. Roost, now 55, had graduated from George Washington University with a degree in political science, and worked as a press aide on Capitol Hill, as a university administrator, and as a grant writer for nonprofit organizations. She became a freelance journalist, and, using her reporting skills, set out to find the woman her parents had given up. Ms. Roost documented this search for a story that will air on WNYC’s Snap Judgment podcast.

Ms. Roost dug through Illinois adoption and birth records and searched the internet, eventually finding the woman: Angelle Kimberly Smith. It was 2015, and Ms. Roost called Ms. Smith, nervous about what she might say.

The conversation did not go as Ms. Roost had imagined.

“She was really, really cool about it,” Ms. Roost said.

That’s because after the Sandbergs had given her up, Ms. Smith had landed with a loving couple, Harry and Ruth Smith, who were black. Her father ran a stationery store. He also was heavily involved in an underground lottery, with tentacles that extended into the city’s political and organized crime worlds, she said. Her mother was a homemaker. Her upbringing, Ms. Smith said, was comfortable and loving in a solid, black middle-class neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side. She attended a private grammar school.

But tragedy struck when Harry Smith died of a heart attack when his daughter was just 8.

Ms. Smith and her mother endured. Her mother ran the stationery store, she said, and neighbors treated them like family.

“I was raised by people that really loved me and really wanted me,” said Ms. Smith, now 55.

As she entered adulthood, Ms. Smith moved to Los Angeles, lured by the prospect of a glamorous life. Instead, she found trouble.

In spite of her stable home life, Ms. Smith said she was sucked into freewheeling circles in which drugs were common. She became addicted to cocaine, she said, and became homeless and was incarcerated for burglary. She had four children, two of them while living on the streets, and lost custody of all of them.

Ms. Smith eventually pulled her life back together. She earned an associate degree, started working on bachelor’s and master’s degrees online and worked as a counselor. By 2007, all of her children were back in her life. She wanted to learn more about who she was, so she searched for her biological parents, listed as Neal Gordon and Juanita Green on her birth certificate, but never found them.

But life had taken so many twists and turns that by the time she heard from Ms. Roost, she felt she could handle anything. She greeted the news that she had been given up by a white family by telling Ms. Roost that she held no hard feelings, and would not have wanted to be raised by white parents in a white neighborhood.","The Adopted Black Baby, and the White One Who Replaced Her",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/the-adopted-black-baby-and-the-white-one-who-replaced-her.html

But the result may not be what Mr. Trump is envisioning — a Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm would most likely cost thousands of jobs, doing the very opposite of what the president said would happen.

If Qualcomm were to raise its offer for NXP, it could make itself less attractive for Broadcom.","Yet it was only theater.

Within 24 hours — for those paying attention — Broadcom’s real motivation emerged: The company was planning to mount a $100 billion bid for the rival chip maker Qualcomm in what would amount to the largest hostile takeover of technology company in history.

The reason for Broadcom’s sudden move back to the United States was clear: Given President Trump’s aversion to foreign companies, there was no way that Broadcom would ever receive regulatory approval for a takeover of one of the crown jewels of Silicon Valley if it were based anywhere but here. After all, Qualcomm’s chips are inside virtually every major American device, starting with Apple’s iPhone.

So Broadcom played to Mr. Trump’s soft spot — bringing companies back home. But the result may not be what Mr. Trump is envisioning — a Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm would most likely cost thousands of jobs, doing the very opposite of what the president said would happen.

Some of those workers who stood behind Mr. Trump in the Oval Office could very well end up on the chopping block.

If there is any question about Broadcom’s job killing ambitions, look no further than its own news release, which said “the combination of our two companies and associated synergies will be accretive to Broadcom’s earnings.”

Notice the word “synergies”? That word, a throwback to the 1990s merger days, has returned, but no one has forgotten what it is a euphemism for: cost-saving layoffs. Analysts have estimated that the savings from such synergy in Broadcom’s case would most likely be about $1.5 billion.

Qualcomm has about 33,000 employees worldwide; about 10,000 of which are based in San Diego. Broadcom has nearly 16,000 employees worldwide, nearly half of them in the United States.

When Broadcom merged with in Avago in 2014, it said it expected $750 million in “synergies.” At the time, Broadcom had 10,650 employees and Avago 8,200, for a total of 18,850 workers. Yet by 2016, after the two companies had integrated (and accounting for a divestiture that included 430 employees), the total head count was 15,700. In other words, 2,700 people lost their jobs.

By that math, considering Broadcom said it could achieve twice those savings in a deal with Qualcomm, some 5,400 people could lose their jobs — a good portion of the entire domestic head count at Broadcom.

Broadcom has made a business model of acquiring other companies, and their technology, and laying off employees. Some analysts describe the company as a “roll-up” — a company that keeps rolling-up more companies.

Qualcomm has been one of technology’s great innovators, helping to establish many of the mobile telephone standards like LTE and the coming 5G. It has one of the largest research and development budgets in the world, spending $5 billion last year alone. Over the past decade, it has spent nearly $40 billion.

Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion “in research and engineering.” Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.

And while the sound bite about Broadcom’s bringing its $20 billion in revenues back to the United States sounds great, it isn’t so clear it will happen immediately — or ever. About half of the company’s revenues come from its Chinese partners. It is impossible to think the company won’t have to continue to invest there given that’s where much of the growth in the world is taking place.

So far, Qualcomm has rejected Broadcom’s overtures, calling the bid an opportunistic effort to buy the company on the cheap. Qualcomm’s stock has been under pressure because it has been engaged in a patent lawsuit with Apple, which has argued that Qualcomm is trying to gouge it for using its chips in its phones and has threatened to use Intel chips instead. Broadcom, in turn, has hinted that if it were to succeed in its bid for Qualcomm, it would reach a settlement with Apple.

The deal, which is already complicated, was made more so on Monday when Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, argued that a planned deal by Qualcomm for NXP — which had been moving ahead despite the Broadcom bid — undervalues NXP, creating new questions about the fate of that transaction. If Qualcomm were to raise its offer for NXP, it could make itself less attractive for Broadcom.

Even if Broadcom doesn’t end up merging with Qualcomm, it is unimaginable that it won’t try to acquire other American companies, which may make its decision to redomicile ultimately make more sense.

If Broadcom was not intending to repatriate to the United States, you can only imagine the early morning tweetstorms we would have read from Mr. Trump denouncing the hostile bid.

“It all comes down to not feeling like a criminal, being seen as a criminal,” said Douglas Dracup, 31, whose Hitman Coffee Shop on South La Brea Avenue is one of these spaces. Parties, he said, have “set the stage for the industry to flourish.”

Below, a recent tour of Los Angeles’s flourishing pot scene.

High Tea

In a gated office building off Sunset Boulevard, tucked between a parking lot and two motels, about 25 people gathered one recent Saturday for “White Rabbit High Tea.” Jessica Cole Eriksen, 34, began hosting tea parties in April 2016 after working as a nanny in Ireland where brew was a daily ritual. “I’m rolling joints so, everyone, let’s get rolling,” said Ms. Eriksen, who brought a box filled with masks and hats for people to wear. “I’m so happy you are here on this lovely afternoon.”

Some were friends or guests who read about the tea party, which cost $65, online. “I saw it on Instagram last month, and I thought I would come,” said Bridgett Davis, in between puffs under her leopard-print hat. “In December I’m going to pull out my mink. It’s a different kind of crowd, not teenagers or millennials.”

Holden Jagger, a former executive pastry chef at the Soho House who started a cannabis cooking and cultivation business last year, prepared the meal. The table was set with place cards, gold lace paper napkins and strategically arranged ashtrays. There was no pot in the roasted corn and buttermilk scones. But there were plenty of joints, vape pens and edibles on the table. A server wearing a crimson dress and rabbit ears poured peach green tea.

Tara Dawn Roseman, an eyebrow aesthetician, examined a bottle of lotion infused with medical marijuana.

“My dad loves this stuff,” said Roxanne Dennant, whose company, Fruit Slabs, makes cannabis-infused fruit leather. “He rubs it on his hands.”

“My hands are always hurting,” Ms. Roseman said.

“Then use some!” Ms. Dennant said. “They are on the table to be used.”

There were a lot of products to try: cannabis-infused cellulite cream, lip balm, chocolate cookies and small bottles of artisanal buds from Northern California. Ms. Roseman brought some pot from home, which she dumped on a plate so she could roll a joint. Platters of finger sandwiches were passed.

“Do you find yourself with friends that want to talk about something else?” said Ms. Dennant. “We can’t. We are passionate.”

Ms. Eriksen refrained from smoking because she was pregnant. She watched as guests eyed the buds on the table. “You get a gift bag so you don’t need to pocket anything,” she said.

As caramel popcorn and apple pie cookies were passed, the table grew silent. A man put a zebra mask over his face and scrolled through his cellphone. “I was just staring off into the sky and thinking, ‘I am sufficiently stoned,’” Ms. Dennant said.

Ms. Davis said, “You feel like not talking so much anymore.”

Mr. Jagger joined the table. “I had a mom give me a cookie once,” he said, recalling his early 20s. “I just couldn’t talk for a while. My arms were moving, but my mouth wasn’t working. She put a whole plant into butter and it was pretty strong.”

When he was a younger man, Mr. Jagger said, he prided himself in baking potent cookies. Nowadays, cooks are better at tempering the high. “The idea that we can manage it,” he said, “takes the fun out of it.”

Budtender to the Stars

Maya Cooper was dressed in raspberry tights, gold chains and a blue kufi, a tableau that looked vaguely like vintage MC Hammer. It was the day before Halloween, and Snoop Dogg was hosting his wife’s birthday party, a 1980s-themed bash in an industrial building near the airport. “It’s my job to know everybody,” said Ms. Cooper, holding court in a hazy, smoke-filled lounge packed with couches and a bar crowded with jars of marijuana bud, rolling papers and smoking accessories.

Ms. Cooper, 31, is the associate director of marketing for Merry Jane, a digital media company started in 2015 by Snoop Dogg to promote marijuana culture. She is better known, though, as a “budtender” to the stars. An Ohio native who once worked for Rolling Stone, she said she taught Gwyneth Paltrow how to use a vape pen. She has hosted bud bars at parties for Diplo and Calvin Harris, the music producers. Ms. Cooper has even spun cannabis-infused sugar into cotton candy for Miley Cyrus at a birthday party for Ms. Cyrus’s boyfriend, Liam Hemsworth.

These days marijuana is marketed like coffee beans. Humboldt’s Finest, a collective from Northern California, was that night’s sponsor. Among the strains scrawled on a menu were Sunset Sherbet (“luscious melty treat”), Cookies (“an uplifting, potent high”) and OG Kush (“for total body melt”). A guest sidled up to the bar and asked for six joints and some buds for a bong. On the dance floor, where Snoop Dogg was twirling with his wife, trays of pre-rolled joints were passed by female servers.

Last January Ms. Cooper teamed up with a dispensary to host a bar at the 30th birthday party for Cade Hudson, a talent agent who works for Creative Artists Agency. The party was held on the roof of an apartment complex in Beverly Hills, and about 200 people showed up. The singer Nick Jonas asked for a joint, Ms. Cooper said. Others kept their distance. “Sometimes celebrities will pass by,” she said. “They aren’t interested in coming to the station. So we bring the gift bag to them.”

Ms. Cooper said sponsors don’t get paid to give away product, which makes a bar a costly proposition. The average price of a joint is about $3.50; small batch or craft cannabis costs twice that. “It’s hard to regulate celebrities,” she said. “They are used to having whatever they want.” The music crowd is notoriously grabby. So much so, she toyed with the idea of making people who give parties pay. Ms. Cooper said they ran out of pre-rolled joints halfway through the night at a Def Jam event during Grammy week.

“People kept coming back to the bar,” she said. “They try to pretend like they are someone else. They kept stuffing their pockets. Someone even came over to the table, but this time with his hat off. I said, ‘I still recognize you.’”

Bake Sale

Photo

When Jessica Assaf talks about marijuana, she always uses the word “she.” “It is the female plant that creates this precious flower,” she said one evening at a party in Venice. The booming cannabis market is filled with female entrepreneurs. “We are a community,” said Ms. Assaf, a former beauty and marketing executive. “And we show up for each other.”

Indeed. About 100 people crowded a fenced-in yard at the home of Abby Gould, an acquaintance of Ms. Assaf’s who works for a firm that invests in the cannabis industry. Lit candles were placed on wooden railings. A singer playing acoustic guitar serenaded guests gathered on the front lawn under a string of lights. No one was sipping chardonnay. The crowd was there for a “Bake Sale” sponsored by Cannabis Feminist, the company Ms. Assaf founded a year ago to sell marijuana wellness products at home.

It was like a Tupperware party for the smoke set. Guests bought tickets for $5, which were exchanged for edibles, creams or smoke. (Gifts of cannabis are allowed, Ms. Assaf said; direct sales are not.) There were oils by Foria to enhance sexual pleasure, a powder from Mondo that could be sprinkled in food to soothe an anxious mind and Hmbldt vape pens to calm, sleep or arouse. One woman bought $105 worth of pink tickets for cannabis-infused capsules with turmeric to reduce chronic inflammation.

Ms. Assaf is adept at creating community among her peers, organizing weekly get-togethers. “It is an important part of reaching the audience,” said Derek McCarty, the chief marketing officer for Hmbldt. “People turn to their best friends for advice.” Cannabis Feminist teamed with Snoop Dogg’s Merry Jane to create a series, “Queens of the Stoned Age,” a chat show with Ms. Assaf and guests who explore their relationship with cannabis. They hired an all-female crew and Ms. Assaf committed to including more ethnically diverse smokers in coming episodes.

Despite the transactional nature of the Bake Sale, there was still, as one might imagine, a relaxed vibe.

Hannah Mason, a founder of Lit Yoga, set up a low-slung table and pillows under a tree. She had nothing to sell; she was there to support her female mates. Ms. Mason served green tea and passed joints to passers-by who joined her, something she and her students share before every yoga class. One student, Ryan Der, a maker of custom iron doors, was there. “It’s cool to connect with humans,” he said, packing a rolling paper. “Most of the time everyone is on their phones.”","Hey, ‘Budtender’: Los Angeles’s Power Brokers of Pot Crank Up the Kook",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/style/marijuana-clubs-los-angeles.html

“That’s not writing, that’s typing,” Truman Capote said about Jack Kerouac, who wrote “On the Road” on a 120-foot scroll of paper and rarely revised.

The poet A. R. (Archie) Ammons (1926-2001) also wrote a book on a scroll. His “Tape for the Turn of the Year” (1965) was composed on a skinny roll of adding-machine tape, which he threaded through his typewriter, a “ribbon of speech.”

It was an endearing performance, and very Ammons. He twice won the National Book Award — in 1973 for “Collected Poems,” and in 1993 for “Garbage” — for his work, which tended to make you feel you were sitting beside him as he typed.

Here now is “The Complete Poems of A. R. Ammons” in two slab-like volumes. It’s a rocking double-wide mobile home of electric American verse. The cube-like density of these books is imposing until you open the screen door.

Ammons had a friendly, open, searching style, one that sometimes veered toward the metaphysical (“abstraction is the bogey-boo of those incapable of it,” he wrote) but tended to find its grounding in the crunch of wit or a small, superb insight.

He provided commentary as he went along, sometimes blowing raspberries at his own performance. In “Tape for the Turn of the Year,” there were moments when he debated stomping on his coil of paper.

When he left the house he unspooled the whole thing, he wrote, and brought it along, in case of fire. (Did Kerouac lug his scroll around like a football?) “I’m so tired / you can’t imagine,” he tells his readers, nearing the end. He thanks us for coming along.

Image A. R. Ammons Credit Dede Hatch

On the most bedrock level, Ammons was a nature poet. Daily he was out amid the moss and grackles and the zucchini vines and the roadkill. He didn’t issue “cry of the loon” writing, however, to borrow an old New Yorker magazine put-down of overwrought nature prose.

If he saw a jay out before sunrise, it was probably “wheeling & dealing.” His poems are dense with weather reports, emotional and literal. His book “Garbage” meditates on what we’ve done to our blue-green planet as well as to our minds.

If I tend not to regard Ammons as a nature poet, it’s because I prefer him when he is talking about other things. Moping about his career, for example, he wrote in 1967:

what I need I mean is a champion or even a host of champions,

a phalanx of enthusiasts, driving a spearhead

or one or two of those big amphibian trucks

through the peopled ocean of my neglect:

I mean I don’t want to sound fancy but

what I could use at the moment is

a little destruction perpetrated in my favor.

He had a way, when the dew grew too thick on the leaves of his verse, of breaking into rude song:

Baby, you been stomping round on my toes so long

They’re breaking out in black and blue hyacinths,

Well-knit forget-me-nots

Geraniums are flopping out over the tops of my shoes

tendril leaves coming out along the edges of my shoelaces.

Ammons wrote often about sex, too, its own form of dancing:

swing!

your partner,

promenade (and when

you can

get laid

get laid)

Ammons sat down at his desk every day and wrote whether he had anything to say or not. Because of this, he wrote more guff than most important American poets. There is a not always pleasant sense of him working things out in real time.

He knew he could strain a reader’s patience. Please turn in your hymnals, he wrote, to page “Archie carrying on again.” He once referred to his career as “50 years of yapping.”

Ammons carries you along because as he vamps, like a musician, there’s a sense of drama, of his mind expanding and contracting. He will hit his groove and deliver a string of intensities. Then he will pull back because the beauty is too much; he’ll wait for the next moment to strike.

Is it O.K. to love a poet because he writes well about napping?

half an hour is great: an hour exactly twice as good, and all day

practically incalculable: but judge not me as you must not others:

some of the drowsy-looking people you see have had so much food, sex,

and sleep that the only sign of life on them is a tiny smile of dumb bliss.

His charm was so great you only slowly realize how much loneliness and anger and depression swam behind his verse. He wrote: “Some mornings, I don’t know whether / to discharge a gun or an obligation.”

Ammons hoped that the point in his poetry would be “delivered below / the level of argument, straight into the fat / of feeling.” He got there more than most poets of his time.

Ammons could be high-minded but he had few pretentious bones in his body. He told us what he wanted and, like Babe Ruth pointing at the bleachers, he delivered:

I want to do well: I want people to say,

did you hear that, that sounded good.

Pittsburgh — Of all the questions that the ascendancy of Donald Trump has raised — on the value of political experience in governing, on the fitness of business executives as government executives or the profile of the Republicans as defenders of the rich and the Democrats as the sentinels of the poor — none is as perplexing as perhaps the central question of the age:

Does the truth still matter?

It emerged again recently when reports surfaced that the president, who had previously acknowledged his presence on the “Access Hollywood” videotape, has suggested that he did not make the comments on the tape. He also resumed questioning whether Barack Obama was born in the United States — despite having said he accepted it as true last year. In a speech, Mr. Trump, contradicting almost every analysis of the tax bill, said the measure would hurt wealthy people, including himself.

For nearly a half-century in journalism, from hometown cub reporter to national political correspondent to metro daily executive editor, I’ve navigated with the aid of a newspaperman’s North Star: the conviction that there is such a thing as objective truth that can be discovered and delivered through dispassionate hard work and passionate good faith, and that the product of that effort, if thoroughly documented, would be accepted as the truth.

Mr. Trump has turned that accepted truth on its head, sowing doubts about the veracity of news reporting by promoting the notion that the mainstream media spews “fake news.” Employing an evocative, sinister phrase dating to the French Revolution and embraced by Lenin and his Soviet successors, he has declared that great portions of the press are the “enemy of the people.”

Much of the Trump rhetoric on the press, to be sure, is less statecraft than stagecraft, designed to dismiss negative stories — as if the media had been never critical of past presidents instead of the equal-opportunity pugilists who bedeviled Bill Clinton (in the Monica Lewinsky episode) and George W. Bush (in the aftermath of the Iraq war).

The suspect in the explosion, Akayed Ullah, 27, was wearing an “improvised low-tech explosive device,” said James P. O’Neill, the New York City police commissioner. Mr. Ullah had the device attached to his body with velcro and zip ties, and he was walking east in the passageway when it detonated, the police said.

Clearly Mr. Roberts has grown since last year’s “Gêmeos,” a hectic and hollow creation for Ailey II.","John Coltrane and David Byrne aren’t casual choices for a choreographer looking for dance music — at least they shouldn’t be. Yet last week, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater proved that there’s a place for both. Twyla Tharp’s “The Golden Section,” set to music by Mr. Byrne and returning to the repertory this season, still shimmers. True, the dancers need more time to live in the groove of her tricky coordinations — the movement needs to look as though it’s melting off the body — but nothing checks that box faster than performance time.

The surprise came in the somber radiance of Jamar Roberts’s new work, “Members Don’t Get Weary,” which had its premiere on Friday at New York City Center. Clearly Mr. Roberts has grown since last year’s “Gêmeos,” a hectic and hollow creation for Ailey II. Perhaps, for him, a dance like “Members” is what happens when choreographic intention is more important than steps. It has that ease.

A veteran of the Ailey company, Mr. Roberts may be known for his strength and commanding presence as a dancer, but he has a softer side too, and both came through in “Members,” set to two recordings by John Coltrane, “Dear Lord” and “Olé.” The program included a Ralph Ellison quote about the blues being “an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one’s aching consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it.” Those words reverberate throughout “Members.”

The work began with Coltrane’s ballad “Dear Lord,” in which the cast — dressed in Mr. Roberts’s blue and lavender costumes that deftly blurred the line between chic urban wear and work uniforms — was stationed on the stage in two groups.

It made for a striking opening scene, helped by Brandon Stirling Baker’s lighting and scenic design: Five dancers, bending forward and reaching up with imploring arms, clustered close in a corner of the stage, while five others stood along the back of it.

The new tax law would not take effect until 2018.","In the scorched landscapes of California, a little-noted provision of the Republican tax overhaul has property owners worried about being burned twice: Once by the wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes, and then again by being denied a tax write-off for their losses. But there is much confusion about the legislation’s actual effects. Here are answers to some of the vexing questions.

How does current tax law treat losses in a wildfire?

As things stand now, taxpayers who suffer what are called casualty losses that exceed 10 percent of their adjusted gross income can deduct the excess amount, to the extent that it is not covered by insurance. The Internal Revenue Service says casualty losses can include those from “natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes,” as well as “losses from fires, accidents, thefts or vandalism.”

The deduction helps soften the blow for people who are uninsured or underinsured, and many homeowners’ policies do not cover the full value of their property, according to Michael Simkovic, a professor of law and accounting at the University of Southern California. Taxpayers nationwide deducted $1.6 billion in 2015 for losses from natural disasters, the I.R.S. calculates, and much of that was in California: the state’s Department of Finance reports that in 2015, nearly 100,000 federal returns filed in California claimed casualty loss deductions totaling about $700 million.

What would change under the Republican tax plans?

Both versions of the tax legislation now moving through Congress would take away the deduction for personal losses in wildfires. The House bill would eliminate the casualty loss deduction entirely; the Senate version would retain it only for losses in “federally declared disasters,” and wildfires have hardly ever been so declared.

Does that mean victims of this year’s wildfires would be out of luck?

No. The new tax law would not take effect until 2018. People whose homes were destroyed in 2017 would still be covered by the old law. They would, however, have to tally their uninsured losses and claim them on their 2017 return — the one they must file by April 15, 2018, unless they get an extension.

When it examined internet freedom in 65 countries in 2016 and 2017 (representing 87 percent of global internet users), its Freedom on the Net project found governments in nearly half of the nations deploying some form of manipulation to distort online information to stay in power and undermine the opposition.

The practice has become significantly more widespread and technically sophisticated. Bots, propaganda producers and fake news outlets exploit social media and search algorithms to integrate seamlessly with trusted content, posing a devastating new threat to democracy. The dangers undermine elections, political debate and virtually every other aspect of governing.

In Turkey, 6,000 people have been enlisted by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party to manipulate discussions and counter opponents on social media. The government of President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico relies on an estimated 75,000 automated accounts — Peñabots — to overwhelm political critics on Twitter. In Iran, the government has long created internet sites that mimic those of legitimate news organizations like the BBC; these fakes are filled with conspiracy theories and anti-Western propaganda.

The fabrication of grass-roots support for government policies creates a closed loop in which the authorities essentially use social media to endorse themselves, making the views of citizens irrelevant.

Restoring trust in social media and the internet requires defensive actions against the manipulation armies. A first step is for the United States and other democracies to ensure that political advertising is at least as transparent online as it is offline, an issue now being debated in Congress. Online political ads should be required to indicate who sponsored them; social media companies should have to make this information available and indicate the source of the payment for such ads.

As we have seen in recent weeks, big tech companies also face pressure from Congress and European governments to more aggressively weed out hate speech and to take other steps to remove online sludge. There is indeed room for smarter curation of news feeds and search algorithms — with more human oversight.

But these approaches, unless handled skillfully, also risk narrowing political debate and undermining internet freedom, as witnessed in Germany, where popular social media companies are now required to take down offending information quickly or risk fines of up to 50 million euros.

The problem is likely to get more complicated. More and more data is being collected about Americans’ political views, personal habits and sensitive financial and health information, while that data is becoming harder to keep secure from hackers and hostile governments.

Those forces are part of the weaponization of the internet used so skillfully by Russian operatives and their protégés. Online manipulation also becomes easier if perpetrators are able to identify a subgroup of people most susceptible to their message and most likely to share it with others in their network, a task made easier by the data-collection practices of popular social media companies.

There is no panacea; constant vigilance and education are required to attack this problem. Young people and other web users must be taught to take seriously the demands of cybersecurity. High schools should be including media literacy as part of history and social science curriculums.

Most of all, students and others must be put on alert that there really is fake news — false information deliberately planted by malevolent actors — and that they need to be on guard against propaganda masquerading as truth.

Desert Water So Magical I Would Bottle It

Located next to the Mexican border are the Chinati Hot Springs, which are filled with minerals meant to cure back pain and irritated skin. Texans go to soak in the outdoor pools of water, surrounded by aloe plants, the dry desert dirt and the big blue sky. What everyone tells you once you’re there is that the tap water has lithium in it. Drink it, and you feel drowsy, a little lighter than usual. As the lore goes, Donald Judd, who had settled in the nearby town of Marfa, wanted to bottle the water and sell it at Dean & Deluca in SoHo, but never really made it happen. Today, both visitors and locals go to the springs for a soak, often bottling some extra water to save for themselves. — THESSALY LA FORCE

Lavender-Infused Ice Cream, From Down Under

Lavender is in full bloom during Australian summer months — December through February, — which is also the ideal time to indulge in an ice cream cone. And the Bridestowe estate, a lavender farm in Tasmania, brings both things together, deliciously. Bridestowe’s ice cream is made locally with pure Tasmanian dairy and flavored with lavender oil that is grown, harvested and bottled right on the farm. (Despite the fact that lavender originated in France, Bridestowe is the largest plantation in the world for the plant — which, thanks to its purity, is both culinary- and perfume-grade.) Visitors can stroll through 260 acres of the blooming plant and then stop by the cafe for a sweet treat, for about 5 Australian dollars, on their way out. — CATHLEEN O’NEIL

The Greek Cheese I Dream About

There are few dishes that stick in your mind long after you’ve consumed them. One of mine is the giant scoop of homemade goat cheese that’s served at the Pantelis tavern on the mostly-deserted island of Marathi, a short boat ride from Patmos in Greece. Made fresh from the milk of local goats, the mild, velvety cheese is drizzled with oregano and olive oil atop a simple cucumber, tomato and olive salad. Marathi has no cars, no roads and very few inhabitants, which makes it an intensely magical place to drop anchor for the afternoon and have one of those lovely, late, lazy beach lunches the Greeks do best. — ALEXA BRAZILIAN

A Custom Surfboard — But to Buy It, You Have to Pass Muster

Any avid surfer will know of the legend Skip Frye, who has been an influential figure in the surfing community since the 1960s — and who is renowned for his prized handmade surfboards. Throughout the decades, these boards have become highly desirable for their signature shapes and unsurpassed quality. But getting your hands on one is not so easy: Skip, who is over 70, is highly selective when choosing whom he makes boards for in his hometown San Diego, and only works with a limited number of customers a year who are serious about surfing. That’s right — although the boards look beautiful and would be perfect above a mantel, Skip wants his surfboards in the water, and not hung on a wall. — ALEX TUDELA

Lots of people stealthily steal ashtrays from hotels as souvenirs — an idea I’ve always thought was romantic. Unfortunately, I’m a terrible thief.

Mykonos’s Most Special Pareos

Tucked beneath the stairs on a side street in Mykonos sits El Pareo, a tiny store specializing in pareos (sarongs) from Bali.

Antique Receptacles, Given New Life

The artist Liselotte Watkins hijacks antique vessels she finds at markets or stores around Italy — and, as she puts it, “gives them a face and life.” The results are beautiful, whimsical, even Matisse-like — and I’ve been coveting one for a long time. (Just imagine how good it would look on a crowded bookshelf, or overflowing with flowers.) For her 2016 show at CFHill gallery in Stockholm, she saw the pots as “an army of women.” Watkins says of the inspiration behind the collection of pots: “It was all about the matriarchy but also about the beauty of the collective. It was the women I see everyday. The dry-cleaning lady, the cafe lady, the mothers at my kids’ school, the lady in the apartment downstairs. They are all there.” — ISABEL WILKINSON

Handwoven Towels That Transport Me to Kenya

I traveled to Ol Malo — a wonderfully remote ranch and game reserve in the northernmost reaches of Kenya’s Laikipia plateau — a few years ago. Every summer since, I am reminded of my time there when I lie on a perfectly oversize beach towel I bought at the lodge’s little gift shop, which sells artisanal items lovingly made by the local Samburu tribe.

Secret Mezcal, Straight From the Source

The smoky spirit is now available around the world, but if you want the best stuff — or, at least, mezcals that aren’t adulterated by giant liquor importers or wreaking havoc on Mexico’s agave crop — then you must visit Oaxaca, the spiritual home of mezcal, where most varieties are made in small batches, often secretively, using a traditional method that involves burying agave hearts in the ground to roast. Before your trip, email the Maestros del Mezcal, an advocacy organization that helps local producers bottle their liquor rather than sell it to a third-party, and eventually build their own brands; Maestros del Mezcal isn’t a tour company, but if you ask, they’ll take you to a few of the palenques (mezcal distilleries) in their cooperative to meet the owners, witness the process and purchase a likely unlabeled 750ml bottle for around $100. Making it last the journey home is on you. — KURT SOLLER

艾伦比进入耶路撒冷后，英国统治耶路撒冷30年。在建立犹太人家园的犹太复国主义愿景吸引下，大量犹太定居者在此期间涌入耶路撒冷。与此同时，当地的阿拉伯民众也接受了奥斯曼帝国灭亡的现实。从1517年开始，耶路撒冷一直处于奥斯曼帝国的统治下。

从那以后，以色列士兵在哭墙祈祷的画面便深深印在以色列的国家意识中——在约旦统治期间，以色列人被拒绝前往那里。

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.
The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers.
One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

“Our outcomes are nowhere near where we want them to be as far as on-time graduation and achieving competencies,” said William G. Clark, president of the Urban League of Rochester, which is part of the coalition that released the report. “And our homeless and formerly homeless students are only at half of that.”

The Education Trust found that there are schools where homeless students did better than statewide averages — there were 169 schools where this was the case in math and 164 in reading. A vast majority of those schools were in New York City, and about a third of them were charter schools.

“When we see these very successful schools that have reached homeless students, it really is a bright spot,” said Anna Shaw-Amoah, principal policy analyst at the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness. “It’s a point we need to be making, that these low proficiency scores we’re seeing over all really can rise up. It doesn’t need to be that way.”

Abja Midha, the deputy director of the Education Trust-New York, visited a few of the schools where homeless students performed well. She said that while each approach was tailored to that school’s particular community, they all used targeted academic help and intensive engagement with the families, and tried to address the social and emotional needs of their homeless students.

The study was written with an eye toward a federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was signed by President Obama in 2015. Under that law, states are required to report on the academic outcomes, like state test scores and high school graduation rates, for students in temporary housing. The coalition that released the study, which advocates on how best to implement the new education law in New York, includes civil rights, education and business organizations from around the state.

“Our coalition believes that the reason E.S.S.A. is so important is that it provides an opportunity to shine a light on how well schools are doing for every group of students,"" said Mr. Rosenblum of the Education Trust. “As we think about what groups of students are particularly vulnerable, it’s clear that the education system needs to do a better job of serving students in temporary housing and formerly homeless students.”","No Longer Homeless, but Still Struggling in School",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/homeless-students-school-new-york.html

In one instance, a woman said she was compelled to straddle Mr. Batali to get past him as he sat blocking an exit.

Mr. Batali had also recently been reprimanded because of a complaint made in October by an employee at one of the more than 20 restaurants in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, a company spokesman said on Monday.

The spokesman said that Mr. Batali had been required to undergo sexual harassment training above what is already required of employees. He then volunteered to keep away from the restaurant where the employee worked, and he has done so, said the spokesman, who declined to be identified by name.

The spokesman would not name the restaurant where the woman worked, and it was not immediately clear whether the employee was among the women interviewed in the Eater report.

After the Eater report was released on Monday, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group said in a statement that it had taken further measures that extended to all his restaurants.

“Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and he has already done so,” it said. It also said that the company had provided employees with access to an outside investigations firm if they want to make claims against corporate officers or owners.

The recent allegations against Mr. Batali led ABC to ask Mr. Batali, who has been on “The Chew” since 2011, to step away “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” the network said in a statement on Monday.

“ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment,” the statement said. “While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”

The allegations against Mr. Batali were among the latest to be made against prominent men in several industries following a New York Times report in October about women accusing the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment.

The revelations about Mr. Batali have shaken up the food industry, where he is also a best-selling author of cookbooks. He has long appeared as a television personality in cooking competitions, including “Iron Chef America” and “Top Chef.”

Last year, he was enlisted by Michelle Obama to put together the last state dinner of the Obama presidency.

The allegations concerning Mr. Batali drew quick response from the food industry, including suggestions that such behavior was widespread.

Tiffani Faison, an American chef who was a finalist on the first season of Bravo’s reality show “Top Chef,” suggested that there was a culture of silence in professional kitchens.

“I cannot believe we are in a true watershed moment when NOT ONE MAN has gotten ahead of allegations,” she wrote on Twitter. “They all know what they did and are just hoping their number doesn’t come up. That is the opposite of integrity.”

Like many of Mr. Batali’s colleagues, Traci Des Jardins, the San Francisco chef and restaurateur who has known Mr. Batali since the late 1980s, was conflicted about the reports.

She and others expressed sympathy for the thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the Batali brand, as they did when allegations surfaced against John Besh, the high-profile New Orleans restaurateur, in October. In that city, people have vowed not to go to Mr. Besh’s restaurants, and calls for boycotts of Mr. Batali’s restaurants arose, although some expressed caution about such a boycott, saying it would hurt workers who had nothing to do with his behavior.

The chef and television personality Tom Coliccho, who has been one of the few male chefs speaking publicly about sexual harassment in the restaurant business since news about Mr. Weinstein and others came out, said he was not surprised to hear about Mr. Batali.

“Am I supposed to report rumor and innuendo and suspicion?” he asked. “It’s not my story to tell. This is about the women and it damages the ‘me, too’ movement if we don’t let them speak for themselves.”

Mr. Batali is among a small group of chefs who helped diners deftly navigate a transition from decades of Eurocentric dining to one more distinctly American, and became a celebrity doing it.

Although Italian-American chefs had long been cooking regional specialties, Mr. Batali is largely credited with educating an entire nation on the delights of tripe, beef cheek ravioli and spicy squid through his restaurants and his first television show, “Molto Mario,” which ran from 1996 to 2004.

He was raised outside of Seattle, where his family still lives and operates Salumi, a widely praised cured meat shop in Pioneer Square. After graduating from Rutgers University and training in kitchens in Italy, he moved to New York in 1992. From there he built an international empire with his partner Joe Bastianich that, in addition to more than 20 restaurants, includes the Eataly Italian market franchise and a television career that ranged from scrappy shows when Food Network was in its infancy to a regular spot on “The Chew.”

At his first restaurant, the tiny Po in Greenwich Village, he made his name with fresh pastas and other dishes that, while not quite authentically Italian, were brightly flavored and deeply appealing. Po opened in 1993, when most American food lovers were just beginning to understand the world of Italian food in between the two poles of red-sauce “Southern” and cream-rich “Northern.”

In 1998, he opened Babbo Ristorante in New York’s West Village. It was an immediate hit, receiving three stars from Ruth Reichl, then the New York Times food critic. His white-tablecloth place in the meatpacking district, Del Posto, was the first Italian restaurant to earn four stars from The New York Times, bestowed by Sam Sifton.",Mario Batali Steps Away From Restaurants Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/dining/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

That is why they are sold as domestic slaves,” Ms. Sharma said.
“Sometimes they’ve been abused in the houses, and many of them are beaten up badly,” Ms. Sharma said.
While offers of domestic work can sound attractive to an impoverished teenager, the reality is horrific.
After studying in New York, she returned to India to begin her work on photographing survivors of sexual violence in India.","The lush floodplains of Dooars, India, appear to go on forever. Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, the green is so vibrant it is all consuming.

But beyond the riverbeds, in an area once known for its bustling tea gardens, Dooars’s dirt roads can be perilous. They are barely proper roads, and the commute to school by foot is long and dangerous, making girls easy targets for attackers and traffickers.

“They’re like fishermen waiting for the bait,” said Smita Sharma, a photojournalist documenting survivors and their families.

The area has become a hub for domestic servitude trafficking. Girls as young as 10 are put in households through traffickers posing as placement agencies. They are almost always taken by someone they know — a relative, a neighbor, an acquaintance — and sold for $300 to $1,000. Ms. Sharma had already been working over the last three years on documenting survivors of sexual violence in India. But she kept coming across women who had been trafficked and sold into domestic servitude, an industry she says gets little attention in comparison.

“These girls are not in demand in the sex industry because they are too dark and skinny. That is why they are sold as domestic slaves,” Ms. Sharma said. “If they were more fleshy or voluptuous, they would be in high demand in the sex trade.”

Employers engage the services of placement agencies, looking for domestic help, but what they don’t know is that some of these girls arrived via a modern day slave trade. They were kidnapped, sold to placement agencies and then put in houses for domestic work. Each handler — from kidnapper to agency — receives a commission. Some people try to justify the trafficking in servants as being beneficial to the young victims. “People have this attitude that these people are poor, if I’m taking her and giving her shelter and food that’s enough,” Ms. Sharma said. “But that’s not enough, that is against human rights violations.”

Ms. Sharma, who splits her time between Delhi and Calcutta, has met at least 30 women who are survivors of the region’s trafficking. She has partnered with Shakti Vahini, an anti-trafficking organization, and local police to connect her to trafficking survivors and the families of missing girls.

“Sometimes they’ve been abused in the houses, and many of them are beaten up badly,” Ms. Sharma said. “You have to make them comfortable and make them trust you, but they do share their stories.”

People in the region make on average $1.50 a day, if employed at all, Ms. Sharma said. Tea gardens were once the backbone of the local economy, home to tea growing operations, hospitals and even schools. But once the British left in 1947, so too did the jobs, forcing people to look elsewhere for work. Many collect stones from the riverbed that are sold for construction.

While offers of domestic work can sound attractive to an impoverished teenager, the reality is horrific. One girl was kidnapped, taken on a train and raped outside a connecting railway station. She somehow escaped, eventually making her way back to her village with a police escort. The girl was taken to the police station along with her attacker. But the perpetrator’s relatives antagonized her and pressured her to withdraw her charges. The girl wasn’t even allowed to see her parents, in hopes of weakening her.

Ms. Sharma said it was so easy to set up a placement agency, that some of the families of the young women were unaware how they ended up as domestic servants. In one case, a mother of three who was a victim of domestic violence went to her mother for safety. But her mother couldn’t take her in. That’s when a man promised her a good job in the city. Instead, she was sold into servitude and placed in a house. It took a year before the woman broke down and told her employers how she had ended up in their home. The police were eventually contacted, and the woman was returned home to her husband.

While Ms. Sharma is listening to and telling the stories of survivors and their families, she’s also healing a wound of her own. When Ms. Sharma was 18, a professor molested her one day after school. But when she spoke out about it, she was told she was “over smart” and “didn’t know how to respect my elders,” she said.

That’s why she became a photojournalist. After studying in New York, she returned to India to begin her work on photographing survivors of sexual violence in India.

Today, she’s more driven than ever.

“I lost total confidence,” she said, “and I thought, ‘I have to do something with my life that’s meaningful and one day when I speak up, people are going to listen.’”

Diabetes is now Mexico’s top killer, claiming 80,000 lives a year, the World Health Organization has reported.
For many Mexicans, Nafta promised to make real “the fever dreams of joining the modern economy,” said Timothy A.
But Jaime Zabludovsky Kuper, Mexico’s deputy chief negotiator on the pact, said Nafta didn’t cause obesity.
Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico’s largely isolated economy.","But few critics predicted it would transform the Mexican diet and food ecosystem to increasingly mirror those of the United States. In 1980, 7 percent of Mexicans were obese, a figure that tripled to 20.3 percent by 2016, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Diabetes is now Mexico’s top killer, claiming 80,000 lives a year, the World Health Organization has reported.

For many Mexicans, Nafta promised to make real “the fever dreams of joining the modern economy,” said Timothy A. Wise, a trade expert at the Small Planet Institute and Tufts University. “All former rural workers would be in new jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing industries of the post-Nafta world. That just hasn’t happened.”

“The only way that Mexico became a ‘first world’ country was in terms of diet.”

The phenomenon is not limited to Mexico. Research shows free trade is among the key factors that have accelerated the spread of low-nutrient, highly processed foods from the west, “driving the obesity epidemic in China, India, and other developing countries worldwide,” according to the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.

But Jaime Zabludovsky Kuper, Mexico’s deputy chief negotiator on the pact, said Nafta didn’t cause obesity. Instead, he said, it lowered food prices and reduced malnutrition. In 2012, 1.6 percent of Mexican children suffered from severe malnutrition, a sharp drop from 6.2 percent in 1988, according to government data.

Mr. Zabludovsky said that Mexicans had long been enticed by American food, and that high tariffs used to make it expensive, not unavailable. The economy is now more stable, he said, and Mexicans are living longer — which is partly why more people are dying from noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease. “It’s a symptom of relative prosperity,” he said.

The broader pros and cons of Nafta have come under increasing scrutiny given President Trump’s threats to dismantle it. Among its chief champions are American farm and food-retailing interests whose fortunes have benefited tremendously from the open market. Mexican exports to the United States have surged, and a more stable economic structure has evolved in Mexico. The country’s unemployment rate has stayed mostly constant, but average wages have fallen to $15,311 in 2016 from $16,008 in 1994, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico’s largely isolated economy.

In addition to dramatically lowering cross-border tariffs, Nafta let billions of dollars in direct foreign investment into Mexico, fueled the growth of American fast food restaurants and convenience stores, and opened the floodgates to cheap corn, meat, high-fructose corn syrup and processed foods.","A Nasty, Nafta-Related Surprise: Mexico’s Soaring Obesity",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/health/obesity-mexico-nafta.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Mr. Sprankles’s house, which sits on a one-acre lot, was spared, a fact that he attributes to his wife spending around five hours every week cutting overgrowth and collecting fallen leaves.

“Last week we had three barrels full,” he said.

In San Diego, Joanne Salzman applauded the program, noting that her home was also safe.

“We could have lost all of this,” she said.” Because when it takes one house, it takes another. I think it definitely helped.”

John Buchanan, an engineer paramedic with the district, said he saw examples last week of homes that firefighters were able to save because residents had cleared brush. “The fire came right up to around 40 homes and we were able to protect all of them,” he said.

Over all, 151 homes in his district were destroyed by the Lilac Fire in San Diego County, compared with around 250 during the last major wildfire in 2007, Mr. Buchanan said. The Lilac Fire was 80 percent contained on Monday.

Mr. Buchanan described seeing the fire leap over a four-lane highway driven by intense winds. “It looked like a million fireflies flying over to ignite the tinder dry brush,” Mr. Buchanan said.

However, Richard Halsey, the director of the California Chaparral Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection of shrub land, said the fires of the past two months had proved what he argued has become the increasing futility of brush-removal programs that might have been effective.

“It’s not working,” he said. “These fires in October and this month clearly demonstrate we’re doing something wrong. We are not understanding that in this changing climate, with these fierce winds, nothing is going to work unless we address the flammability of these structures.”

Mr. Halsey said it would make far more sense to invest in home fire prevention systems — sprinkling systems that coat the outside of a house with a mist of water, and fire-resistant roofs — and to stop encouraging developments on land that are prone to wildfires.

But Chief Terrazas said it would be a mistake to abandon the brush-cutting policies. He said that while they might not have been as much help over these past two weeks, fires in California take very different forms.

But the congressman’s status changed sharply last week, when the House Ethics Committee announced that it was forming an investigative subcommittee to examine Ms. Greene’s allegations. Ms. Greene, who won the $84,000 settlement, is said to be cooperating. Mr. Farenthold has promised to repay the Treasury and insists his conduct has been proper.

Got a confidential news tip about sexual harassment? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

“I’ve done nothing wrong,” he said in a brief interview last week. “I’m happy to visit with anybody who has a concern and explain the facts to the extent that I am allowed to under the settlement agreement.”

Details of Ms. Greene’s allegations have been known for several years, ever since she filed suit against Mr. Farenthold in 2014; she said, among other things, that Mr. Farenthold told another aide he was having “sexual fantasies” about her and that she was fired after she complained.

But she was not the only Farenthold aide to find fault with the office environment; in 2016, two additional aides complained — prompting the congressman to hire an independent law firm to investigate, a spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold, Stacey Daniels, confirmed in a statement.

One aide reported that Mr. Farenthold’s chief of staff, Bob Haueter, treated the female employees “differently.” The second aide — identified by The Houston Chronicle as Elizabeth Peace, a former press secretary to Mr. Farenthold — reported to Mr. Haueter that the first employee “did herself engage in inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace,” the statement said.

The review found no evidence of “gender bias” or “inappropriate sexualized comments,” Ms. Daniels said, adding that all staff members, including Mr. Farenthold, later “took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure full compliance with office policy and the law.”

In an interview, Ms. Peace said “the behavior never changed,” which was partly why she decided to quit in March. “There were a lot of inappropriate things that happened in that office that I don’t think would have happened if the congressman hadn’t already set the tone,” she said.

Ms. Peace and another former aide to Mr. Farenthold, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harming that aide’s reputation, described an atmosphere in his Washington office that was freewheeling, yet also filled with anxiety.

The congressman, they said, was volatile. When he was angry, they added, Mr. Farenthold would berate them, sometimes sweeping his arm across his desk, knocking its contents to the floor, and threatening to fire people. Ms. Daniels, who has worked for Mr. Farenthold since March, said she had never witnessed such behavior, adding, “All the staff get along here very well.”

The refrigerator in the “bullpen” — the open area where aides worked — was filled with beer, and sometimes happy hour would begin at 4:30 p.m., which his aides called “beer-thirty.” Ms. Peace said women would discuss which male lobbyists had texted them pictures of their genitals, and both men and women would talk about strip clubs and whether certain Fox News anchors had breast implants.

“There were numerous lewd comments that were made either about female reporters’ breast size, or other reporters’ breast size as well as female lobbyists and their appearance that would go on,” the other former aide said. “On any given week you were prone to either ridicule, rude comments, acts of aggression or rage.”

In the office, the congressman was known to like redheads. In her complaint, Ms. Greene said Mr. Farenthold “regularly drank to excess, and because of his tendency to flirt, the staffers who accompanied him to Capitol Hill functions would joke that they had to be on ‘redhead patrol’ to keep him out of trouble.”

In their response, lawyers for Mr. Farenthold acknowledged that “some staff occasionally joked that Rep. Farenthold finds redheads attractive.” But they said he denied the rest of that allegation, including “the implication that this was a source for, or cause of, concern for any staffer.”

Experts in civil rights and employment law say that the culture of any office or organization is set from the top and that sexual harassment may be more prevalent in workplaces in which there is anger and infighting among employees.

“If you are trying to create a workplace where sexual harassment and other sorts of unlawful harassment don’t happen, you really need to be thinking about workplace culture more broadly and about civility and respect,” said Emily Martin, the general counsel for the National Women’s Law Center here.

Kristin Nicholson, who spent 20 years as a House aide and now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, said that every office on Capitol Hill reflected the personality of the lawmaker and the chief of staff.

“Anecdotally we all know that there are offices out there that are really toxic or unpleasant to work in, whether it’s sexual staff or the way that stuff is treated,” Ms. Nicholson said. “I don’t think that’s the norm, but it’s certainly not unusual for staffers to be subjected to inappropriate comments or sexist remarks.”

Mr. Farenthold, who turns 56 on Tuesday, has had a whiff of notoriety about him ever since he first ran for office in 2010. At the time, he was best known as a host of a conservative radio show. But during his campaign, photographs surfaced of him at a costume party, wearing duck-print pajamas and standing next to a scantily clad woman.

He won the election, ousting Representative Solomon P. Ortiz, then an incumbent Democrat who had served for more than two decades, by less than one percentage point. The Republican-controlled legislature then redrew the district lines, making the district much more conservative. He is now serving his fourth term.

In 2014, the same year in which Ms. Greene sued him, Mr. Farenthold announced that he would be giving up an internet domain name — one that describes a sexually explicit act — that he had held since 1999, when he was in the business of buying such names on speculation and selling them.",Tawdry Tales Depict a Texas Congressman’s Frat House on the Hill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/blake-farenthold-sexual-harassment.html

As usual, Mr. Putin left himself plenty of wiggle room by saying that “a significant part” of the troops would come home.
Mr. Erdogan said at the news conference that after discussing Syria with Mr. Putin on Monday, the next step was to hold a second meeting in Sochi, Russia.","At each stop, there was some accomplishment or friendship to trumpet.

In a brief visit to a Russian air base in Syria, where he was greeted by President Bashar al-Assad, Mr. Putin again said that Russia’s military had achieved its mission and would head home, a pledge he first made in March 2016 and has broken repeatedly in the past.

In Egypt, Mr. Putin and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi discussed several issues that reflected Moscow’s expanding role. They confirmed at a news conference that Russia had agreed to resume direct tourist flights to Egypt, suspended after the bombing of a Russian airliner in the Sinai Peninsula in 2015, which could restore billions of dollars in revenue. And they appeared to confirm the signing of a contract for Russia to build a $30 billion nuclear plant, Egypt’s first. Late last month, the two countries were reported to be exploring an agreement for the Russian air force to use Egyptian military bases.

The trip to Turkey was the last scheduled for the day, with the agenda focused on political talks to end the war in Syria and the sale of an advanced Russian S-400 air missile defense system to Turkey. Russia has in the past refused such a sale, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said at a joint news conference on Monday that the two countries would this week “come together to conclude necessary work for S-400.”

The session was the eighth time Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan have met this year, and lately they have been getting together every two weeks.

Russia has taken full advantage of the American reluctance to engage in various Middle East conflicts, especially Syria, to reconstruct relations with various capitals like Cairo, which expelled the Soviets in the early 1970s after years of close military cooperation.

Although Mr. Putin is assured of victory in the 2018 presidential election in March, he is seeking a record turnout and a record level of support, according to reports in the Russian news media.

To do that, he needs both to generate excitement in a lackluster campaign and to at least appear focused on domestic issues, according to various analysts, even if he personally seems far more animated when discussing foreign policy than fixing roads. Hence, he wants to significantly reduce the Russian role in Syria before campaigning begins in earnest in February.

“People are not that much concerned about Syria, it is a faraway land that people do not know much about,” said Konstantin von Eggert, a political analyst and talk show host on independent television. If Russians think about it at all, he and other analysts said, they typically wonder why the Kremlin is spending money in a region long peopled by savages bent on killing one another.

In Syria, Mr. Putin repeated that Russian forces had defeated the threat from Islamic militants that they had come to confront two years ago, although many believe that the real purpose was to shore up Mr. Assad, at the time Russia’s last ally in the region.

“In two years, the Russian armed forces, together with the Syrian Army have defeated the most combat-capable group of international terrorists,” Mr. Putin said in a speech at the Hmeimim air base in Syria. “In connection with this, I have made a decision: A significant part of the Russian military contingent in the Syrian Arab Republic is returning home, to Russia.”

As usual, Mr. Putin left himself plenty of wiggle room by saying that “a significant part” of the troops would come home. He also noted that Russia established a permanent presence, with the Hmeimim base and an expanded naval station at Tartus, Syria.

Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, was even more equivocal, saying that there was no specific timetable for the withdrawal. “It is clear that it is not a matter of a day,” he said.

Some analysts said that Mr. Putin’s visit and announcement of the withdrawal could be seen in part as an effort to pressure Mr. Assad, who up to now has shown remarkable willingness to defy Russia’s stated goal of a substantive political process despite his deep reliance on Russian power.

Russia has not only propped up Mr. Assad’s beleaguered army, but has also helped push international peace talks away from an earlier consensus that Mr. Assad step down before any transition could be negotiated.

But Moscow does not want to indefinitely support a weakened Syrian state with questionable legitimacy. Russia has lost hundreds of military personnel in the fighting, and is spending heavily on the war effort and on propping up the government. And Mr. Putin is eager to declare victory, not only militarily but to cement his leadership of an international diplomatic effort that he sees as crowning Russia’s return to the world stage as an equal to the United States.

Syrian opposition negotiators taking part in the United Nations-led talks in Geneva broadly welcomed Mr. Putin’s troop withdrawal order. “It will help us, it’s good, we are very positive,” said Hind Kabawat, a member of the opposition negotiating team.

They expressed the hope that Russia was now ready to use whatever leverage it had with Mr. Assad to press for compromises that would inject momentum into the Geneva talks. Other analysts noted that if nothing of substance happened in Geneva, or on the Syrian battlefield, then Mr. Putin’s announcement of a troop withdrawal would have had more to do with Russia’s domestic politics than with Syria.

In Turkey, Mr. Putin was expected to seek Ankara’s support in containing Islamist militias in the northern Syrian provinces of Idlib and Aleppo, and would be pressing Mr. Erdogan to recognize Mr. Assad as the legitimate leader of Syria, said Hakan Aksay, a Russia analyst and columnist for the independent Turkish news site, T24.

Mr. Erdogan said at the news conference that after discussing Syria with Mr. Putin on Monday, the next step was to hold a second meeting in Sochi, Russia. He called the close relationship between Russia and Turkey “meaningful for the stability in the region.”

Turkey still calls for the removal of Mr. Assad but, like most in the opposition, no longer insists on his removal as a precondition of peace talks.

Turkey also adamantly opposes having Syrian Kurds at the negotiating table, Mahir Unal, a spokesman for Mr. Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party, told a recent meeting of international journalists. The Syrian Kurdish groups are supported by the United States, but Turkey says they are allied with the outlawed separatist movement, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, and Ankara is increasingly concerned that weapons could be transferred to insurgents in Turkey.",Whirlwind Putin Tour Highlights Moscow’s New Reach in Mideast,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/europe/putin-syria-russia.html

But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Even as more Americans have health insurance since the Affordable Care Act was passed, insurers are increasingly asking consumers to pay a larger share of their costs.
After reporters sent details of Mrs. Furman’s case CVS, Mr. Furman said they received a call from the SilverScript president.
Mr. DeAngelis, the CVS spokesman, blamed the pharmacy for charging the couple more than what their share should have been using their insurance.","In an era when drug prices have ignited public outrage and insurers are requiring consumers to shoulder more of the costs, people are shocked to discover they can sometimes get better deals than their own insurers. Behind the seemingly simple act of buying a bottle of pills, a host of players — drug companies, pharmacies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers — are taking a cut of the profits, even as consumers are left to fend for themselves, critics say.

Although there are no nationwide figures to track how often consumers could have gotten a better deal on their own, one industry expert estimated that up to 10 percent of drug transactions involve such situations. If true nationwide, that figure could total as many 400 million prescriptions a year. The system has become so complex that “there’s no chance that a consumer can figure it out without help,” said the expert, Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, whose company is paid by employers to help them lower workers’ drug costs.

Pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that deal with drug benefits on behalf of insurers, often do negotiate better prices for consumers, particularly for brand-name medications, Mr. Rea said, but that’s not necessarily true for some generic drugs. Insurers’ clients are frequently employers overseeing large numbers of workers, and the companies are focused on overall costs. So when insurers seek deals for generic drugs, they do so in batches, reaching agreements for groups of different drugs rather than getting the lowest price on every drug.

As a result of these complicated layers of negotiation — which are not made public — different insurers end up paying different prices for individual drugs. Further compounding confusion for consumers, some insurers require a set co-payment for each prescription — say, $15 or $20 — even when the insurer reimburses the pharmacy at a much cheaper rate.

Several companies have emerged to capitalize on consumer anger over the confusing variations in price. The players include not only Blink Health and its better-known competitor GoodRx, but also veteran businesses like the benefit manager Express Scripts, which recently helped to start a subsidiary aimed at cash-paying consumers. Amazon, the online behemoth, is also said to be considering whether to join the fray.

Last Sunday, CVS Health announced plans to merge with health insurer Aetna, a move that would create a corporate behemoth that many have said would have little incentive to serve the needs of regular people. Some consumers say their experience with CVS already demonstrates how easy it is to fall through the cracks. In one case, a customer whose plan was managed by CVS Caremark, the drug benefit manager, would have had to pay more for a drug through her plan at a CVS than what she ended up paying at the same store, with a coupon from GoodRx.

Representatives for insurers and pharmacy benefit managers say cases like Mr. Swanljung’s are “outliers.” “There are three to four billion generic scripts written a year, and in the vast majority of cases, they are going to get a better deal by using insurance,” said Mark Merritt, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents benefit managers.

A spokesman for UnitedHealthcare, Mr. Swanljung’s insurer, noted that while Mr. Swanljung got a lower price for generic Crestor through Blink Health, he also takes four other prescriptions, for which he got a better deal by using his insurance. (Mr. Swanljung gave UnitedHealthcare permission to discuss his situation.) Having insurance is clearly valuable, said the spokesman, Matt Burns. In addition, the co-payment for generic Crestor, also called rosuvastatin, in Mr. Swanljung’s plan is set to decrease significantly in January, in large part because the price of the drug has dropped this year.

Consumers also may face penalties if they don’t use their insurance and pay cash to save money. In many cases, insurers won’t let them apply those purchases to a deductible or out-of-pocket spending maximum.

Still, many find that leaving their prescription card at home is worth it. Some have found a better deal even at pharmacies that are owned by their drug plan, like CVS.

Susan Thomson, 55, a university lecturer who lives in Summit, N.J., is covered by a high-deductible plan through her former employer. Her drug benefits are managed by CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health. For at least a decade, she’s been using a prescription lotion called sulfacetamide sodium to treat rosacea, a skin condition.

Last year, each time she filled her prescription at a CVS, she paid $75.07. Checking the CVS Caremark website this year, she learned that the cost had gone up to $99.03 (or $81.51 if she used CVS’s mail order service).

Investigating further, she found that GoodRx offered the same prescription at the same drugstore for $75.57, without her insurance. The prices were even lower at other pharmacies.

“It just doesn’t seem right,” she said. “I just feel that the pharmaceutical industry and health care industry are pulling these numbers out of thin air.”

Michael DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, did not dispute the details of Ms. Thomson’s experience, but said it was rare and attributed the price disparity to her high-deductible plan. Because consumers are responsible for their costs in those plans until they hit their deductible, Mr. DeAngelis said it would take them longer to reach it and they might end up spending more in the long run.

Prices can also vary widely from month to month when consumers pay cash, he said.

Drug-discount cards have been around for decades, and retailers like Walmart have also offered cheap generic drug programs, but both were mainly used by people without insurance.

That is changing. Even as more Americans have health insurance since the Affordable Care Act was passed, insurers are increasingly asking consumers to pay a larger share of their costs. In 2016, about five million people in Medicare hit a stage in which they had to pick up a greater share of their expenses.

Reporters at ProPublica and The New York Times examined whether they could get better prices on 100 of the most prescribed drugs, identified by GoodRx, without using their insurance. ProPublica’s prescription claims are managed by OptumRx, a large pharmacy benefit manager owned by UnitedHealth Group; The Times’s medication coverage for reporters is managed by Express Scripts.

Both reporters found lower prices on GoodRx for at least 40 drugs on the list (many were drugs that can be purchased for $4 at Walmart, without any coupon).

Blink Health also sometimes beat the insurance out-of-pocket costs, but less often than GoodRx. Blink Health recently suffered a series of setbacks when two of the largest drugstore chains, CVS and Walgreens, stopped accepting its discounts, along with a grocery chain, Publix. In November, Blink Health sued its pharmacy benefit manager, which negotiates its prices, claiming that the company, MedImpact, had violated their agreement. MedImpact has not yet formally responded to the allegations in federal court in New York.

GoodRx, a private company founded in 2010, displays the deals it has with nine pharmacy benefit managers, each offering different prices for different drugs.

“We said, let’s see if we can gather all these prices and see if we can exploit the variation in these contracts,” said Doug Hirsch, GoodRx’s co-founder and co-chief executive, “to see if we can provide better value.”

Dr. Brad Wainer, a family-practice doctor in Berwyn, Ill., said that he frequently shows patients their options on GoodRx to see if they can get a better price. “Most of them don’t believe me until they go and they find it out for themselves,” he said.

Consumers may also pay more if they are covered by plans that require them to pay a set co-payment, no matter the cash price. In some of those cases, the insurers require the pharmacies to send them the difference between what they collect from the consumer and what the insurers have agreed to reimburse the pharmacies.

After a New Orleans television station, WVUE, reported last year on this practice, known as a clawback, lawyers across the country filed lawsuits accusing the insurers — including Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare — of overcharging consumers. The companies are contesting the suits.

Several independent pharmacists said there might be safety issues if consumers buy drugs at different pharmacies. If those prescriptions are filled without an insurance card, pharmacy systems may not catch dangerous drug interactions. “That, to me, is a recipe for disaster,” said Craig Seither, who owns Fort Thomas Drug Center in Fort Thomas, Ky.

Mary Furman, a retired medical social worker in Charlotte, N.C., takes the drug celecoxib, the generic version of Celebrex, to treat her rheumatoid arthritis. When she went to fill a 90-day prescription in April, her pharmacy told her that her share would be $96.89 if she used her Medicare drug plan, offered by SilverScript, run by CVS Health.

Then the pharmacy offered her a deal — only $72.25 if she paid cash, a price the worker said was the same the pharmacy would offer to any customer. “I was flabbergasted,” said Mrs. Furman, who is 72.

Mrs. Furman took the deal, and afterward, her husband, Nelson, called SilverScript to report what happened. The representative told Mr. Furman he was “not surprised.”

The couple then reported the experience to a company hired by Medicare to investigate fraud, but a representative encouraged her to contact the health plan again.

After reporters sent details of Mrs. Furman’s case CVS, Mr. Furman said they received a call from the SilverScript president. Mr. DeAngelis, the CVS spokesman, blamed the pharmacy for charging the couple more than what their share should have been using their insurance. (Medicare rules require that consumers always get the lower price of their set co-payment and a pharmacy’s cash price.)

Now the Furmans are looking at drug coverage for next year, and once again, they see huge variation in prices for that drug and others.

“The prices are all over the map,” Mr. Furman said.

Instead, it looks far beyond the tax legislation and assumes more robust economic growth than many economists consider likely, largely from economic policies that have yet to be proposed or enacted.

“I don’t believe in magic,” said David H. Brockway, staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration. “It’s just a political statement.”

The Treasury analysis assumes gross domestic product to grow at a rate of 2.9 percent over the next 10 years, rather than the 2.2 percent rate that many other groups have projected. That faster growth would raise $1.8 trillion over that period, paying for the $1.5 trillion tax cut and raising an additional $300 billion, the Treasury report said.

Most economic models have shown the tax bills will reduce government revenues over a 10-year period, even with economic growth. The Joint Committee on Taxation’s analysis of the plan, which does account for a modest increase in economic growth, projected that the tax plan would mean about $1 trillion in lost revenues.

On a conference call to discuss the report, a senior Treasury official said that about half of the difference between Treasury’s estimates for higher growth was based on the proposed corporate tax cut, which would reduce the tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent. The rest of the difference is attributed to reducing taxes for “pass-through” businesses, whose profits flow through to their owners and are taxed at individual rates, and the administration’s plans for infrastructure, deregulation and changes to the welfare system that were outlined in the White House budget proposal this year.

“It’s not a dynamic score of the bill, because it includes regulatory reform, infrastructure and welfare reform,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who was chairman of former President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. “It looks to me like it’s a restatement of their budget.”

The impact of the Republican tax cuts on economic growth and the debt has been a subject of fierce debate among economists, with many arguing that the administration is relying on overly rosy assumptions.

“We acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,” the Treasury Department wrote in the report outlining its analysis of the plan.

Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said the Treasury analysis was “absolutely defensible.” He said that they started with the assumption that Mr. Trump’s economic policies would boost growth by about one percent per year over the decade and worked backward to demonstrate the effects of the tax cuts would not add to the deficit.

“If you just assume you would get that kind of growth, then you say how much revenue you get from that,” Mr. Hassett said on CNBC. “It’s all really just math.”

The Trump administration’s growth estimates have been at odds with those of government scorekeepers for much of this year. Last summer, the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the White House’s 2018 budget and found its estimate for 3 percent growth to be far-fetched. It said that the average gross domestic product growth over 10 years was currently 1.8 percent, and that under Mr. Trump’s plan it would be 1.9 percent — far lower than the rate assumed by the administration.

Several groups that have analyzed the Senate plan using sophisticated economic modeling have found it would not generate anywhere close to the revenues needed to pay for itself.

The Joint Committee on Taxation, the economic scorekeeper of Congress, projected in late November that the Senate bill would increase the size of the economy by 0.8 percent over 10 years, beyond what it would otherwise have achieved — which is well short of the growth path implied by the Treasury one-pager. The committee’s so-called dynamic analysis projected that the Senate plan would add $1 trillion to federal deficits over that time, after accounting for increased growth. That analysis was for the Senate Finance Committee’s version of the bill, not the amended version later approved by the chamber.

On Monday, the independent Tax Policy Center and the Penn Wharton Budget Model each released a dynamic analysis of the bill as passed by the Senate. Both found the bill would add slightly to economic growth over a decade, but not by nearly enough to offset lost tax revenues. The Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would add $1.3 trillion to deficits, after accounting for growth. The Penn model pegged that loss at between $1.5 trillion and $1.8 trillion.

Kent Smetters, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said that Treasury’s view of what the tax cuts would do for economic growth was “aspirational in nature” and not driven by analysis of an actual plan.

The Treasury officials pointed to an assessment from the Council of Economic Advisers and a letter written by leading conservative economists that concluded that the tax cut plan would spur greater economic growth than some outside groups have projected.

Republican lawmakers have seized upon those analyses to assert that the tax cuts will not add to the $20 trillion national debt, yet some of the economists who signed the letter have said otherwise.

Robert Barro, a Harvard professor who signed the letter to the Treasury, said the corporate tax cuts would lead to less revenue in the short run before faster economic growth made up for some of the losses.

“Might be roughly a wash in Year 10, in which case cumulated fiscal deficit over 10 years would rise,” Mr. Barro said, nodding to the fact that the debt would increase over that 10-year period.

Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that he was frustrated that lawmakers were characterizing the letter as affirming that the tax cuts would be fully self-financing.

The Treasury analysis comes as Congress is putting the finishing touches on a tax bill that the House and Senate are hoping to vote on next week. The House and Senate are trying to reconcile their two bills, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade.

A senior Senate aide said Republicans on Capitol Hill were blindsided by the Treasury report and had no warning that it was coming during such as sensitive time in the legislative process.

Treasury had promised to release its analysis before Congress voted on earlier versions of the legislation. The delay in producing any analysis prompted calls from Democrats to look into political interference in the department. Mr. Mnuchin is also under fire for shutting out the career tax staff as Republicans march forward with their overhaul. The Treasury inspector general said last week that an inquiry into the matter was a priority.

Democrats doubled-down on their criticism of the Treasury Department on Monday, calling its analysis “fake math.”

“It’s clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.",Treasury Defends Tax Plan Cost With One-Page Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/treasury-tax.html

Fighting climate change, Mr. Foglia said, is a daunting task that can seem impossibly broad in its scope.","While the consequences of climate change — fierce storms, fragmenting glaciers, blazing fires — can be dramatic, the scientific research supporting its existence is anything but. It’s precise, rigorous and routine work, and though it takes place every day all over the world, it largely goes unnoticed.

Over the past decade, Lucas Foglia’s photographic exploration of the relationship between people and nature has given him a glimpse of the effects of a changing climate from Texas to Sweden. But his interest in climate science started in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on his family’s farm on Long Island, N.Y. For Mr. Foglia, the urge to better understand the forces that contributed to that destruction meant seeking out the unsung individuals who track those forces every day.

“Given how much climate change is in the news,” he said, “surprisingly little attention is paid to the scientists measuring the air.”

They finally get their moment in the spotlight in his book, “Human Nature,” which was published by Nazraeli Press. Over the last two years, Mr. Foglia photographed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate scientists in Colorado and Hawaii. He also spent time in Alaska with the Juneau Icefield Research Program, whose scientists maintain the longest-running study of any glacier in the Western Hemisphere. Scientists from other research groups also appear in his photos.

While climate science is complex, NOAA’s public affairs officer, Theo Stein, said, its methodical, daily execution can appear humdrum.

“It involves people taking measurements with instruments in the same place regularly over a long period of time to build a record,” Mr. Stein said.

Mr. Foglia’s photos don’t shy away from that mundane routine. Many of his images depict regular-looking people operating regular-looking machines. Sometimes, in fact, it’s the same machine over and over. The man shown measuring the air on Colorado’s Niwot Ridge, for instance, is using the same portable sampling unit that another man is pictured using at Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii. And they’re just two of the dozens of scientists around the world who use that machine to get similar samples, which are then analyzed for greenhouse gases.

“One person’s experience in one place doesn’t make a global fact,” Mr. Foglia said. “It’s the coordinated global effort that creates our understanding.”

Among the everyday, Mr. Foglia captured some unusual sights. He noticed an otherworldly crown of thorns plant blooming in a nondescript NOAA office. He caught a scientist appearing to levitate as she descended by rope on a melting glacier. And he found the playfulness in the launch of a balloon-borne scientific instrument from a Colorado field.

“I had imagined that climate science would look incredibly advanced, the way science is often pictured on TV,” he said. “When I got there, I realized it was advanced, but the appearance of it was two men with a balloon.”

Mr. Foglia’s photos constitute a straightforward documentary record. But they also serve as a call to action. By drawing attention to climate science in the United States in particular, he said, he hopes viewers notice that “the science here is most at risk.” In March, the Trump administration proposed cutting NOAA’s budget 17 percent, including a 26 percent cut to research.

Fighting climate change, Mr. Foglia said, is a daunting task that can seem impossibly broad in its scope. But having programs and people to rally behind, he said, can lend that effort focus and optimism.

“I think these scientists are examples of people engaged in programs that deserve support,” Mr. Foglia said.

Lucas Foglia’s work is on exhibit at Fredericks & Freiser Gallery in New York City through January 13.

3. Alabama voters go to the polls tomorrow in what has become a national nail-biter: the special election for the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Roy Moore, the arch-conservative Republican dogged by accusations that he made sexual advances on underage girls, is holding a rally with Stephen Bannon tonight. Doug Jones, his Democratic challenger, is getting a big assist from Democratic and liberal groups across the country.

5. When the Islamic State seized territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014, it had the time and space to manufacture weapons on an industrial scale. We obtained extensive documents that show how the group built up its output levels “unlike anything we’ve ever seen” from a nonstate force.

At times the weapons were exceptionally cruel — booby-traps that blew up homes, heaters packed with explosives. Above, an area of Mosul recently recaptured from the group.

“They’re spreading this knowledge all over the world,” said an explosives expert. “It’s going to the Philippines, it’s in Africa.” He added, “This stuff’s going to continue to grow.”

6. After reports that North Korea is developing the ability to launch submarine-based missiles, the U.S., Japan and South Korea are conducting drills to track such weapons.

Fears of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula are mounting. In China, a leaked document circulating online shows that a county along the border with North Korea is constructing refugee camps that could hold thousands of people.

He’s one of the country’s most high-profile chefs and restaurant owners, and also a best-selling cookbook author. The accusations were first reported by Eater, the food website.

Separately, The New Yorker fired its Washington correspondent, Ryan Lizza, after it said he had engaged in “improper sexual conduct.” He denied the charge.

Scott)分享了他们今年最喜欢的影片。玛诺拉·达尔吉斯在3月，制片人兼导演布莱特·拉特纳(Brett Ratner)说，烂番茄(Rotten Tomatoes)网站“是当今电影文化中最恶劣的东西”，直指该网站“毁了我们这个行当”。对行业有影响力的人攻击影评的情况不常见，但有时候，最后胜出的是绝望。这也许解释了为什么今年8月，哈维·韦恩斯坦(Harvey Weinstein)在Deadline上写了一篇专栏文章，推销他那部延期已久、不久后将一败涂地的电影《狂热郁金香》(Tulip Fever)，承认“写这篇文章可能无异于引火烧身”。10月初，韦恩斯坦被多名女子指控性骚扰和侵犯；11月，拉特纳受到多项严重的性骚扰和行为不端指控，并且，这两名权力掮客显然一直生活在一个截然不同的世界，那里关心的很多问题、规则和道德，和我们的世界迥然不同。真的，几乎是一个平行宇宙。对他们的指控，以及对娱乐行业内外其他有影响里的人的控诉，是2017年的文化故事。在未来一段时间里，它们仍将是故事。或许这就是为什么我会尤其感激今年的电影佳作。尽管出现了各种有冲击力的突发事件，制片人们仍在拍电影，其中一些人还在与根深蒂固的偏见斗争。过去几个月以来的曝光事件——以及那些慢慢被淡忘的受害者的故事——更是有力证明了这些偏见之深。在各种事件和偏见之中，还能有那么多出色的电影，感觉像是一个奇迹。今年的所有种种都像是一种慰藉。以下是我最喜欢的十大电影，均为院线影片或即将上映。1.《敦刻尔克》（Dunkirk，克里斯托弗·诺兰[Christopher Nolan]执导）。大多数的战争片都在讨论输赢，《敦刻尔克》讨论的是生存。用绝佳的手法和技巧，在二战的一场营救任务中，诺兰带你上天、入地、下海。而在营救任务结束后，影片却残忍地明确指出，战争仍在继续。2.《纽约公共图书馆》（Ex Libris: The New York Public Library，弗雷德里克·怀斯曼[Frederick Wiseman]执导）。在这部洋洋洒洒、令人着迷而绝妙的纪录片中，怀斯曼深入探索了纽约公共图书馆——走在宏伟而朴素的大厅里，看到一张张开明而渴求的面孔——为这个作为民主化身的文化和社会机构描绘了一幅肖像。3.《脸庞，村庄》（Faces Places，阿涅丝·瓦尔达[Agnès Varda]和JR执导）。在这部带有鲜明个人色彩的绚丽作品中，瓦尔达与视觉艺术家JR一起游历了法国，走进了过去。他们去认识新的朋友，也在寻找着回忆。人们常说瓦尔达是当今世上最伟大的女导演之一，这话没错。但她也是最伟大的导演之一。Cohen Media Group JR和阿涅丝·瓦尔达在《脸庞，村庄》中。4.《佛罗里达计划》（The Florida Project，肖恩·贝克[Sean Baker]执导）。肖恩·贝克导演了一部令人心碎的作品，有关那些常常被电影忽视的人：一位色情片女演员，以及她在《小明星》(Starlet)中结识的一个被人遗忘的老年女性朋友，和两个在《橘色》(Tangerine)认识的变性女郎。在《佛罗里达计划》中，他讲述了一个极其美国的故事：迪士尼乐园边上的孩子和成人，用迷幻的色彩和一团团唾液挣扎着建起了一部21世纪的《愤怒的葡萄》。5.《逃出绝命镇》（Get Out，乔丹·皮尔[Jordan Peele]执导）。这部电影出产了大量米姆，也是对社会的批判、对我们这个时代的比喻——《逃出绝命镇》讲的全是这些。这也是一个极其出彩的导演首秀片。乔丹·皮尔做得基本都不错，我们也应该记住，这部电影的难忘之处不光在于他说了什么，而是在于极佳的时机把握，疏离的空间感以及让人难以忘却、反复出现的空洞画面。6.《伯德小姐》(Lady Bird，格蕾塔·葛韦格[Greta Gerwig]执导)。自从詹姆斯·迪恩在《无因的反叛》中歇斯底里地喊出自己被四分五裂之后，痛苦的年轻人形象便成为了电影的老一套。格蕾塔·葛韦格拍的这部电影细腻而刺激，这位青春期女孩也非常有戏剧性：我们的女主角跳了车。因此，她不只是活着，在这个主张女艺术家的自我创造并不是牺牲而是一种存在的电影中，她成了一个活生生的人。7.《玉子》（OKJA，奉俊昊[Bong Joon-ho]执导）。奉俊昊用精确的视觉把握和饱和的图画，在这部有时搞笑、有时用情至深的可爱电影中讲述了一个女孩和她的小猪的故事。由于被Netflix收购，这部电影未能得到它赢得的院线公映机会，这家公司似乎一心想要把产品塞进自己的渠道。这或许就是未来，但令人生气的是——正如这部电影中的反面角色——他们不能看到账面以外的东西。8.《魅影缝匠》(Phantom Thread，保罗·托马斯·安德森[Paul Thomas Anderson]执导)。两个生命——两种倔强——在绝美的电影中交织成了一体，还时常有出人意料的笑料。影片讲述了一位有名的时装设计师（由出色的丹尼尔·戴-刘易斯饰演[Daniel Day-Lewis]）和一位他意想之外的年轻缪斯（薇姬·克里普斯[Vicky Krieps]饰）之间的关系。这是一个讲述爱和工作的故事，也是一段大荧幕恋情的形成。Focus Features 丹尼尔·戴-刘易斯在《魅影缝匠》中。9.《宁静的热情》（A Quiet Passion，特伦斯·戴维斯[Terence Davies]执导）。在这部讲述艾米丽·迪金森(Emily Dickinson)的细腻传记片中，特伦斯·戴维斯把画面变作感情。用精致和镜头的切换移动，将你带入艾米丽的日常生活，走近了她深爱的人和他们曾一起住过的房间。他向你展示出了迪金森感受到的、再从笔尖流淌而出的美好、雅致与明暗。10.《神奇女侠》（Wonder Woman，帕蒂·詹金斯[Patty Jenkins]导演）我喜欢我清单上的所有电影，但在今年的所有电影中，《神奇女侠》让我最深刻地感触到这一点：我们观看一部电影时，会回想起全部的往事——童年的遐想，青春期的渴望和成人的疑惑。尽管神奇女侠并不完美，但我一直很喜欢她，包括她在旧电视剧中的形象。我喜欢这部电影中的她，是因为我成人的所有疑惑都比不上这部电影。我喜欢的其他电影是：《比海更深》(After the Storm)；《大病》(The Big Sick)；《尤物：海蒂·拉玛传》(Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story)；《请以你的名字呼唤我》(Call Me by Your Name)；《谁与争锋》(The Challenge)；《道森市：冰封时光》(Dawson City: Frozen Time);《路易十四的死亡纪事》(The Death of Louis XIV)；《逃离》(Escapes)；《嗨翻姐妹行》(Girls Trip)；《好时光》(Good Time)；《奥利·马基一生中最快乐的一天》(The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki)；《我不是你的黑鬼》(I Am Not Your Negro)；《金和安迪：伟大超越——金·凯瑞和安迪·考夫曼以及根据合同规定必须特别提及的托尼·克里夫顿》(Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton”)；《伊斯坦布尔的猫》(Kedi)；《迷失Z城》(The Lost City of Z)；《母亲！》(Mother!

Scott)分享了他们今年最喜欢的影片。

我喜欢的其他电影是：《比海更深》(After the Storm)；《大病》(The Big Sick)；《尤物：海蒂·拉玛传》(Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story)；《请以你的名字呼唤我》(Call Me by Your Name)；《谁与争锋》(The Challenge)；《道森市：冰封时光》(Dawson City: Frozen Time);《路易十四的死亡纪事》(The Death of Louis XIV)；《逃离》(Escapes)；《嗨翻姐妹行》(Girls Trip)；《好时光》(Good Time)；《奥利·马基一生中最快乐的一天》(The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki)；《我不是你的黑鬼》(I Am Not Your Negro)；《金和安迪：伟大超越——金·凯瑞和安迪·考夫曼以及根据合同规定必须特别提及的托尼·克里夫顿》(Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton”)；《伊斯坦布尔的猫》(Kedi)；《迷失Z城》(The Lost City of Z)；《母亲！》(Mother!)；《泥土之界》(Mudbound)；《我的法国电影之旅》(My Journey Through French Cinema)；《诺曼》(Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer)；《鸟类学家》(The Ornithologist)；《帕蒂蛋糕$》(Patti Cake$)；《私人采购员》(Personal Shopper)；《华盛顿邮报》(The Post)；《马斯顿教授与神奇女侠》(Professor Marston and the Wonder Women)；《探索》(Quest)；《歌声不绝》(Song to Song)；《汤斯勒公园》(Tonsler Park)；《双峰：回归》(Twin Peaks: The Return)；《离开的女人》(The Woman Who Left)；《寂静中的惊奇》(Wonderstruck)。

2017年有很多事情让人感觉很糟：你有足够的理由感觉受冒犯、生气、麻木或者觉得恶心。如果这句话让你心情不好，那么我很遗憾（这一年也出现了很多值得怀疑的道歉）。不过，我并不为这份电影清单而遗憾——它列出了前10名以及之后的11名——这些电影让我产生了其他更美好的感觉。不总是愉快的感觉，但它们让我觉得受启发、被打动，感到惊讶和满足。在艰难的时刻，我们对艺术往往要么要求太多，要么期待太少，以为它能治愈或拯救我们，而当它没有实现这些目标时，我们又会贬低它。但艺术的实际功能要简单得多：它让我们保持人性。这就是这些电影今年带给我的。

1.《佛罗里达计划》(The Florida Project)

这部肖恩·贝克的新作是一部独立、关注社会、具有美感的本土冒险电影，它是本年度最欢快、也最令人心碎的影片。它沉浸在佛罗里达中部华丽的物质主义之中，布鲁克琳·普林斯(Brooklynn Prince)欢乐的天性为它注入了活力，威廉·达福(Willem Dafoe)的高超演技为它奠定了基石，令影片给人一种永恒的感觉。普林斯饰演的穆妮(Moonee)则在美国的淘气鬼殿堂里赢得了一席之地，堪与埃洛伊丝(Eloise)和汤姆·索亚(Tom Sawyer)平起平坐。

2.《伯德小姐》(Lady Bird)

在高中排演莎士比亚的作品时，克里斯汀·麦克弗森(Christine McPherson)被选中饰演“暴风雨”。“这个角色的名字和剧名一样！”她和她当时也是未来最好的朋友说。影片是格蕾塔·葛韦格的自传体成长故事，而这句话是片中诸多奇怪、有趣，而又极为机智的台词之一。西尔莎·罗南(Saoirse Ronan)饰演“伯德小姐”（克里斯汀喜欢别人这样叫她），她是一个特别真实可信的美国17岁女孩，影片塑造了她的狂乱世界，其中所有人都得到了尖锐、同情的刻画。片中对友谊、家庭生活和青少年性爱持温和、赞许的态度，但是绝不多愁善感。

3.《逃出绝命镇》(Get Out)

乔丹·皮尔担任编剧并执导的这部作品是2017年绝对不容错过的电影，它打破了电影制作的共识，也打破了票房纪录。该片的一个天才之处在于，它粉碎了美国种族愈合的神话，然后将它的碎片重新组合成一种痛苦而又美丽的东西。它的目的可能是对奥巴马时代进行辛辣的讽刺，但最终可能会被证明是特朗普时代反叛电影的首次爆发。

4.《我不是你的黑鬼》(I Am Not Your Negro)

拉乌尔·佩克(Raoul Peck)的这部纪录片使用詹姆斯·鲍德温(James Baldwin)的语言，不仅描绘了那个时代的这位作家，也展现了他的思想，那些思想超越了他的作品，延伸到我们现在这个充满困境的时代。鲍德温以无与伦比的活力、幽默和洞察力讲述美国的种族主义，他认为，白人危险而阴暗的力量扭曲了这个国家的理想，威胁到了人性。这部电影令人痛苦，那是因为真相就是令人痛苦的。

Sedat Pakay 詹姆斯·鲍德温在拉乌尔·佩克执导的纪录片《我不是你的黑鬼》中。

5.《脸庞，村庄》(Faces Places)

但真相也是可以令人愉快的。然而这并不意味着阿涅丝·瓦尔达的这部最新自传体纪录片中不存在强烈的痛苦。接近90高龄的瓦尔达在一个30多岁、名叫JR的艺术家（他也被列为本片导演）的陪伴下，在法国的乡村漫游，寻找曾经充满活力的工人阶级传统的遗迹。她反思生命中的伤心往事，以及欧洲现在的动荡局面，然而她始终坚信艺术的力量可以保护并且扩展人类的尊严，因此没有沉浸在失望情绪之中。这部电影的每一秒钟都证明她是对的。

6.《魅影缝匠》(Phantom Thread)

人们需要看到当今的重大问题被反映到银幕上，有些电影就是为了满足对电影反映现实的这种渴望。而保罗·托马斯·安德森的第八部故事片——它也可能是丹尼尔·戴-刘易斯的最后一部电影——绝对不是这样。它唤醒了人们对电影的其他欲望与渴望：美、新奇，以及对完美疯狂肆意的追求，而这些东西往往遭到忽视。这部电影我才看了一遍（它将在圣诞节期间上映），我确信它有缺点。我会再愉快地看上十几遍，直到找出所有的缺点。

7.《普通女人》(A Fantastic Woman)

在塞巴斯蒂安·莱利奥(Sebastián Lelio)执导的这部影片中，跨性别女人玛丽娜(Marina)在哀悼去世情人的同时，还要面对他的家庭的敌意。该片有时十分现实，有时又夸张、雄辩，富于诗意，既直截了当，又天马行空。饰演玛丽娜的丹妮拉·维加(Daniela Vega)一开始并没有出现在银幕上，但当她亮相之后（在智利圣地亚哥的一家夜总会里唱了一首火热的歌），摄像机就再也没有长时间离开过她。在她脸上，你可以看到一些昔日电影明星的魅力——她身上有葛丽泰·嘉宝(Greta Garbo)、琼·克劳馥(Joan Crawford)、安娜·玛格纳尼(Anna Magnani)和劳伦·白考尔(Lauren Bacall)的影子——你甚至可以看到令她们能成为明星的那种情感上的真诚。

Sony Pictures Classics 丹妮拉·维加在塞巴斯蒂安·莱利奥执导的《普通女人》中。

8.《毕业会考》(Graduation)

关于“孩子上大学”的电影已经成为美国电影中的一个小类型。今年的例子包括《伯德小姐》、《迈耶罗维茨的故事》(The Meyerowitz Stories [New and Selected])和《你好布拉德》(Brad’s Status)，这些电影都是从轻喜剧的角度讲述这个大家熟悉的人生过渡阶段。曾执导《四月三周两天》(4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)和《山之外》(Beyond the Hills)的罗马尼亚导演克里斯蒂安·蒙吉(Cristian Mungiu)提供了一个更加令人沮丧的视角。一名外省医生希望女儿去英国上大学，为了确保女儿能去，他愿意牺牲自己的理想。蒙吉的这部电影既是一部家庭片，也是一部道德惊悚片，它是对日常腐败的控诉，这种腐败不仅存在于罗马尼亚，而且滋生于任何一个以自私自利为社会最高价值的地方。

9.《宁静的热情》(A Quiet Passion)

其实它并不宁静。与埃米莉·迪金森一样，辛西娅·尼克松(Cynthia Nixon)是一个直率、有时粗暴、往往很有趣、绝对令人兴奋的伙伴。特伦斯·戴维斯的这部非传统传记片轻松愉快，以诗意的凝练和音乐般的优雅回顾了迪金森的一生，展示了她的性格特质以及19世纪新英格兰严肃、知性的环境，那个环境既孕育也限制了她的天赋。

10.《猩球崛起3：终极之战》(War for the Planet of the Apes)

人类的灭绝从来没有显得如此罪有应得，数字技巧也很少用于如此崇高的目的。这个翻拍系列的第三部是关于国家建立的史诗，让人联想起《埃涅阿斯纪》(Aeneid)和《出埃及记》(Book of Exodus)。影片由马特·里夫斯(Matt Reeves)执导，既沉重又刺激，展示了大场面动作电影可以在不影响视觉效果的前提下探索政治和道德问题。安迪·瑟基斯(Andy Serkis)依然是本片的关键。他在三部影片中都饰演凯撒，他的表演是现代电影中最伟大的成就之一，将数字技术与可靠的戏剧表演技巧融合到了一起，令人叹为观止。

我喜欢的电影还包括（按字母顺序）：《劣质爱情》(The Bad Batch);《每分钟120击》(BPM [Beats Per Minute]；《请以你的名字呼唤我》；《道森市：冰封时光》；《我叫他摩根》(I Called Him Morgan)；《神偷联盟》(Logan Lucky)；《迈耶罗维茨的故事》；《泥土之界》；《玉子》(Okja)；《华盛顿邮报》；《水形物语》(The Shape of Water)。",《纽约时报》2017年度最佳电影,https://cn.nytstyle.com/culture/20171207/best-movies/

That is a serious repudiation of his yearslong campaign against same-sex marriage from voters who are otherwise sympathetic to his conservative policy positions. And it’s a pattern that repeated itself to varying degrees in seats held by the loudest opponents to same-sex marriage.

Meanwhile, politicians on the left face a related problem. The responses against same-sex marriage were disproportionately concentrated in Western Sydney’s immigrant communities, in districts dominated by the Labor Party, which has been pro-marriage equality.

A decade of Australian culture wars has obscured these underlying trends because the politicians most vehemently against same-sex marriage have also been the most opposed to multiculturalism and most suspicious of feminism. They have mostly been middle-aged straight white men — Tony Abbott, Senator Eric Abetz, Representative George Christensen — leaving many of us to conclude that these were merely varied expressions of a single prejudice against diversity, in favor of some old social order.

Perhaps it is for this reason that same-sex marriage supporters failed to take immigrant communities seriously. But the opposition put resources into winning over immigrant neighborhoods, distributing bilingual campaign material, some of which made outlandish claims that same-sex marriage would lead to unisex toilets that would give rapists access to vulnerable women.

There is every reason to suspect that immigrants would be inclined to defend multiculturalism, historically supported by the left. They were, for instance, suspicious of the Abbott government’s attempts to water down racial discrimination laws. But tightly knit immigrant communities have been susceptible to this underhanded campaigning on same-sex marriage for a range of reasons.

They are likely to be less immersed in mainstream media, lending conservative religious institutions far greater political authority. Moreover, new immigrants tend to see marriage as an institution that serves the whole family, rather than solely individual needs. Also, Andy Marks, an assistant vice chancellor at Western Sydney University, said to The Australian that within immigrant communities, same-sex relationships are often known by other family members but considered a private matter that has nothing to do with the state.

The pro-marriage campaign’s “love is love” refrain is unlikely to appeal to these families.

The challenge is most profound for conservatives now with the discovery that the people most responsive to their message against same-sex marriage are those multicultural communities they’ve spent years attacking.

A special election last month in the inner-city Melbourne district of Northcote is one recent example that underscores this conundrum. It was a contest between Labor and the Greens, the Liberal Party choosing not to run a candidate in a seat it would never win. The Greens won the seat, but they did it off the back of conservative Liberal voters (polling booths that have historically favored the Liberal Party recorded the sharpest swings to the Greens).

This is significant because the conservative Liberal Party has always seen the Greens as the most radical, unacceptable form of leftist politics. It directs its voters to place the Greens behind Labor in preferential voting. Yet both the Liberal Party and the Greens appeal to affluent, educated, upwardly mobile constituencies. And left to itself, the party’s conservative base appears to see itself more aligned to the Greens’ cosmopolitan constituency than to Labor’s working-class roots. Thus, the boundary between the conservative Liberals and the progressive Greens is more permeable than most politicians assume.

The Liberal Party’s decades of championing free-market liberalism seems to have created a preference for social liberalism built on the logic of individual freedom and equal rights. The trouble for conservatism is that increasingly its urban base is comfortable with more liberal social mores, like same-sex marriage.

The most socially conservative audience in the cities now appears to exist among the immigrant communities it repels with its suspicion of multiculturalism. That leaves a rural white audience who might be sympathetic to its more nostalgic forms of nationalism, but not its liberal traditions, anchored in the free market and (partly for that reason) acceptance of immigration. If the party chases the rural whites, it alienates the conservative voters in the cities, people who are prepared to vote Green as a second choice.

The state is so often stellar in football, residents say ruefully, and not much else, a consequence of generations of bitter fights, political turbulence and eternal divides over race and class.

About 17 percent of Alabamians live in poverty — the fifth-highest rate in the country — and the state’s violence-wracked prisons are jammed to 159 percent of their intended capacity. With budget troubles a chronic fact of life, spending on Medicaid, which has not been expanded, lags. Standardized test scores are among the nation’s lowest. Heart disease and diabetes are endemic.

Last year, Marion, a rural city in central Alabama, suffered a tuberculosis outbreak so severe that its incidence rate was worse than that of many developing countries.

The infant mortality rate for 2016 rose to 9.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, the highest rate the state has seen since 2008. (The national rate was 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, the most recent year for which federal data is available.) The mortality rate was more than twice as high for black infants as white ones, and in some parts of the state, like Perry or Pickens Counties, the rate was 25.6 and 30.3.

“I think we really don’t know why it’s going up,” said Grace Thomas, the assistant state health officer for family health services with the state’s Department of Public Health, who called the rates a “key indicator of a health care system’s effectiveness” and said black, Hispanic and poor women were less likely to get the care they need.

Paris Daves, 24, said it took her several months after she found out she was pregnant last year to get on Medicaid, although she has since drawn support from an organization called Gift of Life, which works to prevent infant mortality in Montgomery. But as a young, single parent, there are other problems, too, like unreliable public transportation and low wages.

“Minimum wage here is $7.25,” said Ms. Daves, who earns a dollar more than that as a shift manager at McDonald’s. “That’s not enough to pay my rent or take care of my son.”

In Haleyville, northwest of Birmingham, the coming shutdown of the hospital looms over the city where, in 1968, the country’s first 911 call was made.

But you can pick anyplace in Alabama and find issues that feel somewhere between daunting and suffocating. In the Black Belt, named for its rich topsoil, but now a region of widespread rural poverty, people still wonder whether once-plentiful jobs will ever come back.

Along the Black Warrior River in Tuscaloosa, professionals and university professors worry about Alabama’s reputation and whether companies with money to spend might look elsewhere. Indeed, many fear that the ultimate fallout from the race will be yet another hit to the state’s reputation and attractiveness as a place to do business.

Huntsville cares about federal spending that helps power an economy that depends on rockets and missiles.

National reporters flocked to a town hall last month in Gadsden hoping for animated discussion of Mr. Moore and the Senate race. Instead, most of the conversation was about opioids, economic development and the extension of Interstate 759.

People here know that no single senator can fix all of Alabama’s ills. Many of the state’s troubles, residents acknowledge, must be solved at the State House in Montgomery, not in Washington. But as the campaign for a rare open Senate seat droops to an end that just about everyone here says cannot come soon enough, there is no shortage of regret that the tawdry overtook the tangible, and topics of statewide concern got little hearing.

“There’s really no other way to put it than a missed opportunity,” said Will Walker, a bank president in Haleyville, the largest city in a county where President Trump won 90 percent of the vote last year. “We’ve had so little discussion about issues, it’s disappointing.”

The state, like its neighbors in the South, is desperate to preserve the economic lifeboats that have emerged in recent decades: big-name foreign manufacturers who put down stakes in exchange for cheap labor, low taxes and lavish incentive packages.

The economic model has created a strange dichotomy: While Alabama often generates headlines about culture-war battles that outsiders view as hopelessly provincial, the flavor of commerce is increasingly, and proudly, international.

Airbus, a French company, assembles jets at a state-of-the-art, $600 million factory in Mobile, working with pieces pre-assembled in Spain, Wales, France and Germany. Mercedes-Benz produces luxury SUVs and sedans along Interstate 20 in Tuscaloosa County. Hyundai has been producing vehicles in Alabama since 2005; Honda, since 2001.

But the strategy only works so well. In 1999, according to census figures, Alabama’s median household income lagged the national median by about $7,800. Today, Alabama lags behind the national median by more than $11,000.

Samuel N. Addy, an economist at the University of Alabama, said the state still has glaring public sector needs in education, infrastructure, health and prisons.

“Those are our four major ones,” said Mr. Addy, “and all of them require raising revenues to meet the needs here. But I don’t think the climate is such that we are open to raising revenues much.”

The poor quality of public education, in particular, has long been a concern in a state where the gap between rich and poor residents — and white and black ones — remains a nagging reality.

The concerns have only seemed to mount with the realization that 21st century manufacturing jobs often require advanced understanding of computer systems: Building a jet is just not the same as running a loom. A year ago, then-governor Robert Bentley, a former church deacon not prone to strong language, at least in public, put the matter in shockingly blunt terms: “Our education system in this state sucks.”

In Escambia County, near the Florida border and the site of Alabama’s death row, Laurine Gentry, 37, said she, too, worried about the state’s schools. This year, she said, the area voted to consolidate some schools, and she worries about her kindergartner, who she says has to ride the bus with high schoolers.

“He hears and sees things that maybe he shouldn’t,” she said.

Ms. Gentry, who said her husband is serving a prison term elsewhere in Alabama, also described the state’s deteriorating prisons. Her husband, she knows, can take care of himself behind bars, but she said the strain on the system is obvious to her family.

“My husband’s last probation officer told me he’s sorry he failed me and my children, because he’s got 70 guys to look after, because it’s hard,” Ms. Gentry said.

Indeed, Escambia County is but one place that struggles. Even with the state’s vast presence and a nearby casino, Main Street is sprinkled with shuttered businesses.

Constructor Notes

My mother, Ilse, was a native German-speaker who, after fleeing her native land in the ’30s, settled in England and studied French in college. My father, Walter, also born in Germany, escaped to Palestine, where he spoke Hebrew by day and studied English by night. They met in England, then emigrated to the United States to marry. Language was consequential in our house: My parents’ linguistic capabilities were inescapably intertwined with their personal histories. And English, especially, represented values they revered — the stiff upper lip of England, and the opportunity to succeed through one’s efforts that the United States offered. They spoke and wrote an English that was not only elegant, but precise: They had too much respect for their adopted tongue to make a grammatical error or to use vague terminology. They were serious about language, except when they weren’t. Dad was a reliable source of terrible puns for every occasion; and both he and Mom loved comedy based on wordplay. My siblings and I grew up playing Scrabble and other word games with our parents and each other. We recognized early on that words could be fun.

“It’s not something you want to mess with during the season,” Martin said.
Photo“Lonzo’s shot is exactly how mine was through my freshman year of college — exactly,” Martin said.
“Once I got to Year 3, I never really heard about it ever again — until Lonzo came along.”No surprise there.
“The kid’s going to be all right,” Martin said.","“And I was like, ‘There’s no way somebody else shoots like me.’ I never thought my form would come to the surface again in basketball history. Then I saw him and said, ‘We have the exact same starting point and end point.’ It’s crazy.”

New Yorkers will get their first up-close glimpse of the most scrutinized shot mechanics in the sport Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, when the Knicks host the Lakers and Ball brings his unsightly shooting percentages of .321 from the floor, .246 from 3-point range and .471 from the free-throw line into one of the N.B.A.’s most storied buildings.

Ball’s struggles to not only make shots but also to consistently free himself from defenders to comfortably uncork his wonky jumper recently prompted the ESPN analyst and former All-Star guard Chauncey Billups — in one of those trademark TMZ video interviews at Los Angeles International Airport — to advise the rookie to reach out to Martin for advice.

Turns out Billups isn’t the only one who has had that thought. Corey Brewer, the veteran Lakers forward who is close friends with Martin, passed along Ball’s phone number in hopes that the two might connect. But the ever-polite Martin — who was reluctant to be interviewed as he would like to keep a respectful distance given the daily hoopla Ball already endures — said he wouldn’t dare impose himself on Ball in the middle of his rookie campaign.

“It’s not something you want to mess with during the season,” Martin said. “Sit down after the season and evaluate everything. Guys don’t want to hear it right now, every little thing that everybody else is saying. There could be a right time later on.”

Regardless of whether Ball ever seeks out Martin, or vice versa, one presumes it would hearten Ball — as well as nervy Lakers officials, coaches and fans — to hear that Martin would advocate only small refinements to Ball’s current approach rather than a wholesale reconstruction.

That’s the way Martin did it, tuning out his own chorus of naysayers by making subtle but crucial changes, summer after summer, starting after his freshman year of college. The Sacramento Kings, who drafted Martin, would later press him to anchor the ball on his right hip before proceeding into his launch, but the big adjustments occurred between the ages of 19 to 21 under the tutelage of David Thorpe, who was recommended to Martin by an assistant at Western Carolina.

Martin would ultimately make Clearwater, Fla., his off-season home to work exclusively with Thorpe, who has trained numerous N.B.A. players (such as Brewer, Miami’s Udonis Haslem, Golden State’s Omri Casspi and the Knicks’ Courtney Lee) and worked for a decade as an N.B.A. analyst for ESPN.com.

“Lonzo’s shot is exactly how mine was through my freshman year of college — exactly,” Martin said. “The N.B.A. is a faster game, so I knew I had to tweak it just a little. Just moving the ball to the right a little bit, away from my face on the release, helped tremendously.”

Combined with the Kings’ subsequent input, which included counsel from the likes of Rick Adelman and the storied former Princeton Coach Pete Carril, Martin went on to shoot 40 percent or better from 3-point range in three seasons and averaged at least 20 points per game for five successive N.B.A. campaigns at his peak.

“When we started working together, Kevin released his shot left of his left eye, too,” Thorpe said. “But in the N.B.A, once we started shifting his shot, he shot the ball mostly from the middle of his forehead and up.”

Thorpe said several top analytics experts he has consulted contend that free-throw percentage in the college game is a better indicator of future 3-point success in the N.B.A. than collegiate 3-point shooting. Ball’s promising conversion rate from deep (.412) in his one collegiate season, combined with his underwhelming free-throw percentage (.672) as a Bruin, would seem to back that up.

But in Martin’s career arc, even though so much of it played out away from the spotlight, Ball should see hope.

“It’s such a funky form, but Coach Adelman used to tell me, ‘I don’t care what it looks like as long as it goes in,’” Martin said. “Once I got to Year 3, I never really heard about it ever again — until Lonzo came along.”

No surprise there. Even with Martin largely out of the game since finishing the 2015-16 season with San Antonio, apart from some part-time ambassadorial work he has done for the league office, chatter stemming from all things Ball is difficult to avoid.

But the beyond-his-years poise Ball has shown, amid such a loud and difficult indoctrination to the pros, is praiseworthy no matter what the numbers say, given the depths of he frenzy swirling around him.

There are ultimately many things Ball can learn from Martin, a shot-fake master who was adept at getting to the foul line to supplement his long-range work. Pump fakes, cleaner footwork, better finishing at the rim, adding a midrange floater — those are all areas where Ball must improve to become more of a scoring threat and make it easier to take advantage of his truly special gifts as a passer.

It would be nice, though, if some patience and perspective could be applied here, especially when Lonzo only turned 20 in late October and is responsible for generating so little of the Lavar-fueled chaos he finds himself in.

As no less an authority than Golden State’s Stephen Curry said recently, attempting to diffuse the pressure that seems to mount on Ball daily, “I hope you didn’t judge me off my first 20 games in the league, either.”

One suspects there will be little leniency from the audience in Ball’s first glimpse of the Garden glare, but he has already won a loyal fan in Martin, who confesses that he’s been watching more of the Lakers than ever before.

“The kid’s going to be all right,” Martin said. “He’s going to be a great shooter when it’s all said and done.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — As Deb and her intrepid cruciverbal Argonauts embark, so I arise from the depths of the Atlantic, rubbing the salt from my eyes and brushing the mermaid’s purses out of my hair, for there can be but one of us at a time at sea, and only one ruling the land.

Howdy! Words can’t express how happy I feel to be back with my puzzling homies — my pomies. Oh wait, they totally can, and do, smack down the middle of this phat little Stu Ockman venture, like a surfer bisecting a gnarly bomb.

Tricky Clues

15A: The “poet who was a friend of Dali” was LORCA, a fairly common puzzle entry, although this is the first time the answer has been clued this way. I knew this because almost 10 years ago I saw “Little Ashes,” a movie about this relationship that starred Robert Pattinson as Dali (in the same year he appeared in the first “Twilight” movie, in case you’re not up on your RPatz trivia).

21A: Another in a nice assortment of original clues, I momentarily considered pronouncing “filbert” the way Stephen Colbert does the second syllable of his name, so got a laugh from that (in my kitchen, alone, from me). The “nut whose name has multiple pronunciations” is, of course, the PECAN, and apparently by “multiple,” Mr. Ockman means at least four. And your choice can tell people where you’re from, what you do on your days off and whether you like long walks on the beach or hiking. Amaaazing. (Ah mazing? Amazzzing!)

So perhaps your daughter detours to law school to become a rainmaking corporate lawyer. Skies are cloudy in that profession, too. Any legal job that involves lots of mundane document review (and that’s a lot of what lawyers do) is vulnerable.

Software programs are already being used by companies including JPMorgan Chase & Company to scan legal papers and predict what documents are relevant, saving lots of billable hours. Kira Systems, for example, has reportedly cut the time that some lawyers need to review contracts by 20 to 60 percent.

As a matter of professional survival, I would like to assure my children that journalism is immune, but that is clearly a delusion. The Associated Press already has used a software program from a company called Automated Insights to churn out passable copy covering Wall Street earnings and some college sports, and last year awarded the bots the minor league baseball beat.

What about other glamour jobs, like airline pilot? Well, last spring, a robotic co-pilot developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, flew and landed a simulated 737. I hardly count that as surprising, given that pilots of commercial Boeing 777s, according to one 2015 survey, only spend seven minutes during an average flight actually flying the thing. As we move into the era of driverless cars, can pilotless planes be far behind?

Then there is Wall Street, where robots are already doing their best to shove Gordon Gekko out of his corner office. Big banks are using software programs that can suggest bets, construct hedges and act as robo-economists, using natural language processing to parse central bank commentary to predict monetary policy, according to Bloomberg. BlackRock, the biggest fund company in the world, made waves earlier this year when it announced it was replacing some highly paid human stock pickers with computer algorithms.

So am I paranoid? Or not paranoid enough? A much-quoted 2013 study by the University of Oxford Department of Engineering Science — surely the most sober of institutions — estimated that 47 percent of current jobs, including insurance underwriter, sports referee and loan officer, are at risk of falling victim to automation, perhaps within a decade or two.

Just this week, the McKinsey Global Institute released a report that found that a third of American workers may have to switch jobs in the next dozen or so years because of A.I.

I know I am not the only parent wondering if I can robot-proof my children’s careers. I figured I would start by asking my own what they want to do when they grow up.

Toby, a people pleaser and born entertainer, is obsessed with cars and movies. He told me he wanted to be either an Uber driver or an actor. (He is too young to understand that those jobs are usually one and the same).

As for Uber drivers, it is no secret that they are headed to that great parking garage in the sky; the company recently announced plans to buy 24,000 Volvo sport utility vehicles to roll out as a driverless fleet between 2019 and 2021.

And actors? It may seem unthinkable that some future computer-generated thespian could achieve the nuance of expression and emotional depth of, say, Dwayne Johnson. But Hollywood is already Silicon Valley South. Consider how filmmakers used computer graphics to reanimate Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin as they appeared in the 1970s (never mind that the Mr. Cushing died in 1994) for “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.”

My younger son Anton, a sweetheart, but tough as Kevlar, said he wanted to be a football player. Robot football may sound crazy, but come to think of it, a Monday night battle between the Dallas Cowdroids and Seattle Seabots may be the only solution to the sport’s endless concussion problems.

He also said he wanted to be a soldier. If he means foot soldier, however, he might want to hold off on enlistment. Russia recently unveiled Fedor, a humanoid robot soldier that looks like RoboCop after a Whole30 crash diet; this space-combat-ready android can fire handguns, drive vehicles, administer first aid and, one hopes, salute. Indeed, the world’s armies are in such an arms race developing grunt-bots that one British intelligence expert predicted that American forces will have more robot soldiers than humans by 2025.

And again, all of this stuff is happening now, not 25 years from now. Who knows what the jobs marketplace might look like by then. We might not even be the smartest beings on the planet.

Ever heard of the “singularity”? That is the term that futurists use to describe a potentially cataclysmic point at which machine intelligence catches up to human intelligence, and likely blows right past it. They may rule us. They may kill us. No wonder Mr. Musk says that A.I. “is potentially more dangerous than nukes.”

But is it really that dire? Fears of technology are as old as the Luddites, those machine-smashing British textile workers of the early 19th century. Usually, the fears turn out to be overblown.

The rise of the automobile, to cite the obvious example, did indeed put most manure shovelers out of work. But it created millions of jobs to replace them, not just for Detroit assembly line workers, but for suburban homebuilders, Big Mac flippers and actors performing “Greased Lightnin’” in touring revivals of “Grease.” That is the process of creative destruction in a nutshell.

But artificial intelligence is different, said Martin Ford, the author of “Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.” Machine learning does not just give us new machines to replace old machines, pushing human workers from one industry to another. Rather, it gives us new machines to replace us, machines that can follow us to virtually any new industry we flee to.

Since Mr. Ford’s book sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place, I reached out to him to see if he was concerned about all this for his own children: Tristan, 22, Colin, 17, and Elaine, 10.

He said the most vulnerable jobs in the robot economy are those involving predictable, repetitive tasks, however much training they require. “A lot of knowledge-based jobs are really routine — sitting in front of a computer and cranking out the same application over and over, whether it is a report or some kind of quantitative analysis,” he said.

Professions that rely on creative thinking enjoy some protection (Mr. Ford’s older son is a graduate student studying biomedical engineering). So do jobs emphasizing empathy and interpersonal communication (his younger son wants to be a psychologist).

Even so, the ability to think creatively may not provide ultimate salvation. Mr. Ford said he was alarmed in May when Google’s AlphaGo software defeated a 19-year-old Chinese master at Go, considered the world’s most complicated board game.

“If you talk to the best Go players, even they can’t explain what they’re doing,” Mr. Ford said. “They’ll describe it as a ‘feeling.’ It’s moving into the realm of intuition. And yet a computer was able to prove that it can beat anyone in the world.”

Looking for a silver lining, I spent an afternoon Googling TED Talks with catchy titles like “Are Droids Taking Our Jobs?”

In one, Albert Wenger, an influential tech investor, promoted the Basic Income Guarantee concept. Also known as Universal Basic Income, this sunny concept holds that a robot-driven economy may someday produce an unlimited bounty of cool stuff while simultaneously releasing us from the drudgery of old-fashioned labor, leaving our government-funded children to enjoy bountiful lives of leisure as interpretive dancers or practitioners of bee-sting therapy, as touted by Gwyneth Paltrow.

The idea is all the rage among Silicon Valley elites, who not only understand technology’s power, but who also love to believe that it will be used for good. In their vision of a post-A.I. world without traditional jobs, everyone will receive a minimum weekly or monthly stipend (welfare for all, basically).

Another talk by David Autor, an economist, argued that reports of the death of work are greatly exaggerated. Almost 50 years after the introduction of the A.T.M., for instance, more humans actually work as bank tellers than ever. The computers simply freed the humans from mind-numbing work like counting out 20-dollar bills to focus on more cognitively demanding tasks like “forging relationships with customers, solving problems and introducing them to new products like credit cards, loans and investments,” he said.

Computers, after all, are really good at some things and, for the moment, terrible at others. Even Anton intuits this. The other day I asked him if he thought robots were smarter or dumber than humans. “Sdumber,” he said after a long pause. Confused, I pushed him. “Smarter and dumber,” he explained with a cheeky smile.

He was joking. But he also happened to be right, according to Andrew McAfee, a management theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whom I interviewed a short while later.

Discussing another of Anton’s career aspirations — songwriter — Dr. McAfee said that computers were already smart enough to come up with a better melody than a lot of humans. “The things our ears find pleasant, we know the rules for that stuff,” he said. “However, I’m going to be really surprised when there is a digital lyricist out there, somebody who can put words to that music that will actually resonate with people and make them think something about the human condition.”

Not everyone, of course, is cut out to be a cyborg-Springsteen. I asked Dr. McAfee what other jobs may exist a decade from now.

“I think health coaches are going to be a big industry of the future,” he said. “Restaurants that have a very good hospitality staff are not about to go away, even though we have more options to order via tablet.

The revelations about Mr. Batali have shaken up the food industry, where he is also a best-selling author of cookbooks. He has long appeared as a television personality in cooking competitions, including “Iron Chef America” and “Top Chef.”

Last year, he was enlisted by Michelle Obama to put together the last state dinner of the Obama presidency.

The allegations concerning Mr. Batali drew quick response from the food industry, including suggestions that such behavior was widespread.

Tiffani Faison, an American chef who was a finalist on the first season of Bravo’s reality show “Top Chef,” suggested that there was a culture of silence in professional kitchens.

“I cannot believe we are in a true watershed moment when NOT ONE MAN has gotten ahead of allegations,” she wrote on Twitter. “They all know what they did and are just hoping their number doesn’t come up. That is the opposite of integrity.”

Like many of Mr. Batali’s colleagues, Traci Des Jardins, the San Francisco chef and restaurateur who has known Mr. Batali since the late 1980s, was conflicted about the reports.

She and others expressed sympathy for the thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the Batali brand, as they did when allegations surfaced against John Besh, the high-profile New Orleans restaurateur, in October. In that city, people have vowed not to go to Mr. Besh’s restaurants, and calls for boycotts of Mr. Batali’s restaurants arose, although some expressed caution about such a boycott, saying it would hurt workers who had nothing to do with his behavior.

The chef and television personality Tom Coliccho, who has been one of the few male chefs speaking publicly about sexual harassment in the restaurant business since news about Mr. Weinstein and others came out, said he was not surprised to hear about Mr. Batali.

“Am I supposed to report rumor and innuendo and suspicion?” he asked. “It’s not my story to tell. This is about the women and it damages the ‘me, too’ movement if we don’t let them speak for themselves.”

Mr. Batali is among a small group of chefs who helped diners deftly navigate a transition from decades of Eurocentric dining to one more distinctly American, and became a celebrity doing it.

Although Italian-American chefs had long been cooking regional specialties, Mr. Batali is largely credited with educating an entire nation on the delights of tripe, beef cheek ravioli and spicy squid through his restaurants and his first television show, “Molto Mario,” which ran from 1996 to 2004.

He was raised outside of Seattle, where his family still lives and operates Salumi, a widely praised cured meat shop in Pioneer Square. After graduating from Rutgers University and training in kitchens in Italy, he moved to New York in 1992. From there he built an international empire with his partner Joe Bastianich that, in addition to more than 20 restaurants, includes the Eataly Italian market franchise and a television career that ranged from scrappy shows when Food Network was in its infancy to a regular spot on “The Chew.”

At his first restaurant, the tiny Po in Greenwich Village, he made his name with fresh pastas and other dishes that, while not quite authentically Italian, were brightly flavored and deeply appealing. Po opened in 1993, when most American food lovers were just beginning to understand the world of Italian food in between the two poles of red-sauce “Southern” and cream-rich “Northern.”

In 1998, he opened Babbo Ristorante in New York’s West Village. It was an immediate hit, receiving three stars from Ruth Reichl, then the New York Times food critic. His white-tablecloth place in the meatpacking district, Del Posto, was the first Italian restaurant to earn four stars from The New York Times, bestowed by Sam Sifton.",Mario Batali Steps Away From Restaurants Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/dining/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Constructor Notes

In the Steinberg family, we keep a small notebook in each room of our house and in the car. That way, if one of us gets inspired by a crossword idea or entry, it can easily be written down. My dad is particularly (in) famous for coming up with crossword ideas in the middle of the night, scribbling them down, and then excitedly barging into my room the next morning to pitch them to me. I love my dad very much, but I’m not at all a morning person, and … well, I don’t always share his enthusiasm about the ideas themselves. On one typical morning a few years ago, Dad was super excited about the idea of doing a shell game puzzle. “You could even stick thimblerig into the puzzle! I bet no one will know that,” he said gleefully as he showed me a picture he’d scribbled down. In the picture, he had three C-U-P arrangements covering a marble, a shell, and a pea. “Sure the cups look triangular, and you can’t actually squeeze a six-letter PEBBLE into a three-letter CUP, but I’m sure you’ll figure something out!” he said as he made his exit. I just groaned and went back to sleep. Fast forward to September of this year. I was looking through one of the idea notebooks (at a non-A.M. hour, mind you) and came across the shell game idea. After chuckling to myself, I decided to give it a makeover. No more triangular cups, marbles, or pebbles (sorry, Dad). In a nutshell, the puzzle eventually turned into what you see. In my opinion, F is the correct answer to the quasi-Schrodinger square at the 127-Across/128-Down crossing, but I could see an argument the other way as well. Happy solving!

O.K., that’s it. We’re definitely going to be seeing a crossword with a “David Steinberg’s Dad” byline one of these days.

Fortune recruited Mr. Loeb in 1986, and under his watch the magazine became must reading in executive suites and among those who aspired to occupy them. Mr. Loeb is credited with reviving the magazine’s profitability and expanding its traditionally tight focus on corporate management and the economy to embrace broader topics, like executive life, and social issues, like homelessness and public education.

Mr. Loeb expanded his reach through radio and television. While running Money’s editorial division, he took over as host of “Your Dollars,” a daily two-minute CBS Radio feature broadcast nationally.

He subsequently began broadcasting “Your Money Minute” for the radio network; a weekly five-minute segment for CBS television; and a 30-second segment, “Money Tips,” for WABC-TV in New York.

In 2012, David Callaway, then editor in chief of MarketWatch, an online financial service (he is now chief executive of The Street, the business news and financial services website), called Mr. Loeb “the father of modern business journalism.”

Mr. Loeb did not dispute the characterization. “It’s extravagant,” he allowed in an interview for this obituary in 2013 at the East 72nd Street townhouse in Manhattan owned by his son, Michael R. Loeb, founder of a successful investment firm. “But I’m not going to argue against it.”

Mr. Loeb died at his son’s home.

After leaving Time Inc. at 65, he edited The Columbia Journalism Review, wrote a nationally syndicated personal finance column, continued to broadcast daily financial advice on CBS Radio and was briefly the host of the PBS television program “Wall Street Week.”

Marshall Robert Loeb was born on May 30, 1929, in Chicago and grew up on what he called the “scruffy” West Side of the city — yearning, by his account, to break free of its confines.

His father, Monroe Harriman Loeb, owned a wrecking and salvage company in Chicago. His mother, the former Henrietta Benjamin, was a milliner and a teacher.

As a young man, Marshall came to see reporters for Chicago’s major newspapers as “heroic” figures whom he said he wanted to emulate, in part to see the world.

He earned a journalism degree at the University of Missouri. (He later said he always regretted that he never studied accounting.) After graduation, “wanting to find out what made Nazi Germany possible,” he said, he went to Germany and worked at an international student house in Goettingen before landing a job as a correspondent for United Press in Frankfurt.

There he met Irmingard Loewe (known as Peggy), a German-French stewardess for Pan American World Airways. They married in 1954. After they moved to the United States, he was hired by The St. Louis Globe-Democrat. But that job did not to satisfy his ambitions.

“I wanted to be sure that what I wrote would be printed or broadcast beyond the place where I was sitting,” he said in a 2009 interview, and he decided he needed to go to New York or Washington “to get that global reach.”

New York it was, after Time hired him. He went on to flourish there as business editor, national editor and economics editor, writing or editing scores of Time cover stories, including one of 8,000 words on J. Paul Getty, billed as the first billionaire. (“There wasn’t that much back then in terms of long-form business journalism,” he recalled in the 2013 interview.)

Over his career he interviewed presidents and covered the space program and a dozen national political conventions, he said. But he considered his work at Fortune to have been his most satisfying.

He expanded Fortune’s use of graphs, charts, lists and tables while continuing the magazine’s tradition of deeply researched articles and its fierce circulation and advertising rivalry with Forbes magazine. He also commissioned a profile of Warren Buffett, a little-known investor at the time, helping to lift him to prominence.

In 1964 he and William Safire wrote “Plunging Into Politics,” which recommended that neophytes begin a political career by working on campaigns at the precinct level. (Mr. Safire went to become a columnist for The New York Times.) His book “Marshall Loeb’s Lifetime Financial Strategies” was published in 1996.

Besides his daughter and son, Mr. Loeb is survived by six grandchildren. His wife died in 2010.

Yet last week, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater proved that there’s a place for both. Twyla Tharp’s “The Golden Section,” set to music by Mr. Byrne and returning to the repertory this season, still shimmers. True, the dancers need more time to live in the groove of her tricky coordinations — the movement needs to look as though it’s melting off the body — but nothing checks that box faster than performance time.

The surprise came in the somber radiance of Jamar Roberts’s new work, “Members Don’t Get Weary,” which had its premiere on Friday at New York City Center. Clearly Mr. Roberts has grown since last year’s “Gêmeos,” a hectic and hollow creation for Ailey II. Perhaps, for him, a dance like “Members” is what happens when choreographic intention is more important than steps. It has that ease.

A veteran of the Ailey company, Mr. Roberts may be known for his strength and commanding presence as a dancer, but he has a softer side too, and both came through in “Members,” set to two recordings by John Coltrane, “Dear Lord” and “Olé.” The program included a Ralph Ellison quote about the blues being “an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one’s aching consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it.” Those words reverberate throughout “Members.”

The work began with Coltrane’s ballad “Dear Lord,” in which the cast — dressed in Mr. Roberts’s blue and lavender costumes that deftly blurred the line between chic urban wear and work uniforms — was stationed on the stage in two groups.

Fighting climate change, Mr. Foglia said, is a daunting task that can seem impossibly broad in its scope.","While the consequences of climate change — fierce storms, fragmenting glaciers, blazing fires — can be dramatic, the scientific research supporting its existence is anything but. It’s precise, rigorous and routine work, and though it takes place every day all over the world, it largely goes unnoticed.

Over the past decade, Lucas Foglia’s photographic exploration of the relationship between people and nature has given him a glimpse of the effects of a changing climate from Texas to Sweden. But his interest in climate science started in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on his family’s farm on Long Island, N.Y. For Mr. Foglia, the urge to better understand the forces that contributed to that destruction meant seeking out the unsung individuals who track those forces every day.

“Given how much climate change is in the news,” he said, “surprisingly little attention is paid to the scientists measuring the air.”

They finally get their moment in the spotlight in his book, “Human Nature,” which was published by Nazraeli Press. Over the last two years, Mr. Foglia photographed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate scientists in Colorado and Hawaii. He also spent time in Alaska with the Juneau Icefield Research Program, whose scientists maintain the longest-running study of any glacier in the Western Hemisphere. Scientists from other research groups also appear in his photos.

While climate science is complex, NOAA’s public affairs officer, Theo Stein, said, its methodical, daily execution can appear humdrum.

“It involves people taking measurements with instruments in the same place regularly over a long period of time to build a record,” Mr. Stein said.

Mr. Foglia’s photos don’t shy away from that mundane routine. Many of his images depict regular-looking people operating regular-looking machines. Sometimes, in fact, it’s the same machine over and over. The man shown measuring the air on Colorado’s Niwot Ridge, for instance, is using the same portable sampling unit that another man is pictured using at Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii. And they’re just two of the dozens of scientists around the world who use that machine to get similar samples, which are then analyzed for greenhouse gases.

“One person’s experience in one place doesn’t make a global fact,” Mr. Foglia said. “It’s the coordinated global effort that creates our understanding.”

Among the everyday, Mr. Foglia captured some unusual sights. He noticed an otherworldly crown of thorns plant blooming in a nondescript NOAA office. He caught a scientist appearing to levitate as she descended by rope on a melting glacier. And he found the playfulness in the launch of a balloon-borne scientific instrument from a Colorado field.

Photo

“I had imagined that climate science would look incredibly advanced, the way science is often pictured on TV,” he said. “When I got there, I realized it was advanced, but the appearance of it was two men with a balloon.”

Mr. Foglia’s photos constitute a straightforward documentary record. But they also serve as a call to action. By drawing attention to climate science in the United States in particular, he said, he hopes viewers notice that “the science here is most at risk.” In March, the Trump administration proposed cutting NOAA’s budget 17 percent, including a 26 percent cut to research.

Fighting climate change, Mr. Foglia said, is a daunting task that can seem impossibly broad in its scope. But having programs and people to rally behind, he said, can lend that effort focus and optimism.

“I think these scientists are examples of people engaged in programs that deserve support,” Mr. Foglia said.

Lucas Foglia’s work is on exhibit at Fredericks & Freiser Gallery in New York City through January 13.

Mr. Farb noted that even these representatives of Lenin and Stalin had fashioned themselves in a Western style, with one almost resembling Cary Grant, and another Charles de Gaulle.","It’s hard to believe, but in 1977, the United States government tapped Nathan Farb, a left-leaning, hippie, Jewish artist to represent America on a public relations trip to the Soviet Union.

Let that sink in for a minute.

During the Carter administration, the U.S. Information Agency organized a traveling photography exhibition, aptly titled “Photography USA,” that toured the Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union. It was part of a multi-year effort by the U.S. government to present positive portrayals of the country — behind enemy lines, no less — which makes it that much stranger that someone like Mr. Farb would have been chosen as a cultural ambassador.

“I think your view of how different I was from, say, a jazz musician on the road for U.S.I.A. is a little overstated,” Mr. Farb deadpanned. “The world was clamoring for American music and jazz. And they sent every great musician around the world, multiple times. Does the world want American cars? Not really. The world wants American culture. And it certainly was that way then.”

A selection of images from the resulting project, “The Russians,” is on exhibit at the Wende Museum in Culver City, Calif., as a part of its mission to focus on the Cold War. His project depicts citizens of Novosibirsk, a Siberian city closer to Kazakhstan and Mongolia than it is to Western Europe. (He called it “the rough equivalent of Cleveland.”) He was included on the six-week trip after he had done a similar tour in Romania, and then begged to be included on the Soviet trip. The desire to visit the Soviet Union was personal for Mr. Farb, since he was raised in Lake Placid, N.Y., and was acutely aware of capitalism’s huge differences in wealth and class.

“I became an 11- or 12-year-old Communist, you might say,” he said. “I grew up in a town where there was enormous wealth, and enormous poverty. It was painful, because I went to school with children who did not have socks to put on inside their galoshes in the winter.

“I think that’s where my early interest in Marx and Lenin came as a boy.”

During the project, Mr. Farb set up a mobile studio to photograph the locals as a demonstration of the technology. And he gave his subjects a Polaroid image as a memento of the experience. Little did they know, however, that there was another, secret, photo. In what feels like something out of a John le Carré novel, Mr. Farb was loading his 4×5 camera with Polaroid Type 55 film, which created both a positive and a negative image.

“I felt I was gaming both the U.S. State Department officials, and I was gaming the Russians,” he said. ‘Nobody really understood what I was doing with the Polaroids. That I had a negative, and that I was going to be able to bring this stuff back.”

He sent the negatives back with his personal mail, through the diplomatic pouches available to him.

As for the photographs, they depict a community that is much less foreign than we might imagine. The fashion represents ’70s style, with jean jackets and paisley prints. According to Mr. Farb, many of the women made their own clothes, and had occasional access to magazines from the outside world, so they joined the funky fresh fashion craze, like farmers hitting Studio 54.

There was also a unique aspect to the city, given its remote location.

“Every morning I would go down to my studio, and there would be these women cleaning up,” he said. “And they would sing the most hauntingly beautiful music. On the second or third day, I thought, ‘Of course, I’m not in Europe, and I’m not in Asia. I’m somewhere in between.’”

The reality was that Mr. Farb had a minder, a member of the Communist Party, to keep an eye on him. Fortunately, he was able to get a photograph of the entire party cadre, including his minder and, yes, it’s as awesome as it sounds.

Photo

The photo shows five dour, serious-looking men, including one who’s a dead ringer for Werner Herzog. Mr. Farb noted that even these representatives of Lenin and Stalin had fashioned themselves in a Western style, with one almost resembling Cary Grant, and another Charles de Gaulle.

There’s a healthy dose of the unexpected in these pictures, from a distance of 40 years, including a young woman with a pronounced mustache, who was apparently the mistress of one of the party chiefs, or the large older woman with the head scarf who’s rocking a serious set of metal teeth.

While the humor and political relevance might make “The Russians” seem of the moment, to Mr. Farb, the pictures are really meant to humanize our fellow man.

Frankly, he became emotional when describing how it felt to have a contemporary audience, online and on the wall, interact with his subjects, many of whom have died in the intervening years. When asked what his greatest desire is, when people look at the photographs, he simply replied: “I want them to love these people.”

Bil Keane of “The Family Circus” drew a feature for Pacific Stars and Stripes. “Gordo’s” Gus Arriola made animated training films. Jack Murphy’s talent had landed him in the Pacific headquarters of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, where he found himself assigned to do oil and watercolor portraits of the senior staff. Judging from his diaries and letters, he did little else but attend church services and work, completing no fewer than six portraits of MacArthur himself, as well as three of the general’s wife and one of his son. As Cullen puts it, “Mass. Paint. Mass. Paint. Mass. Paint. Substitute the pope for the Old Man, and the schedule might have been Michelangelo’s.”

Whatever their wartime contributions, the returning cartoonists couldn’t wait to shrug off the regimentation of military life and return to their “vaguely anarchic” chosen field. The 1950s and early ’60s were the Golden Age of American comics, or at least its glorious tail end. Newspapers were fat and happy, and the hugely popular Sunday comics supplement — comprising about 35 square feet of strips! — arrived on doorsteps wrapped around the news sections, not tucked inside. Cullen recalls an experiment conducted by the supplement’s parent company, Hearst: Various sections of the paper were omitted to see who would notice and care. When a news section was missing, only a small fraction of people called in. When the comics were left out, almost 90 percent of readers complained.

Jack’s original creation was a prizefighter strip called “Big Ben Bolt,” but he dedicated much of his career to “Prince Valiant,” which, by the time he took it over, was already in a class by itself, a stately tent pole of the Sunday comics. With its exquisitely detailed scenes and lack of dialogue balloons, it bore little resemblance to its comics-page peers, evoking instead the elegant illustrations of Gilded Age storybooks. Its level of craftsmanship made “Prince Valiant” a classy anomaly, which is perhaps why it was often placed on the final page of the section, away from the big-foot riffraff. Reading it was a bit of a commitment, as its pacing compelled the reader to slow down, to linger over the intricate images. In designing the page, father and son worked in masterly counterpoint, the text sections and images sliding gracefully past one another in time, interrupted only by the “gutters,” those white spaces between panels where the reader’s imagination took over, advancing the story.

It was an erudite enterprise, meticulously researched and plotted out months in advance. Preparation included consulting voluminous files of images that Jack collected over the years, carefully cataloged under headings like “Ne’er-do-wells, General,” “Arthurian” or “Unrequited.” When just the right image could not be located, one of the children was summoned to take Polaroids of their father festooned in medieval costume or wielding armaments that he stored in the back of the studio. If a child’s pose was needed, Cullen or a sibling was drafted as the model; a queen required the participation of their mother, Joan. Even a visiting neighbor or milkman might be enlisted, only to see himself pop up in the comics six weeks later dressed as a barbarian or wizard. On one occasion, when Cullen pointed out to his father that every face in a band of Goths resembled Jack’s own, he brushed it off, replying that they all would have been related anyway.

These entertaining casting calls aside, Jack mostly worked alone, either in silence or with “Million Dollar Movie” on in the background. When his son joined the family business — “the guild,” Cullen calls it — his occasional presence must have been welcome, but collaboration was mostly conducted from a distance. Still working in isolation, Jack would have had no need to alter the cartoonist’s dress code, one of rumpled indifference. One evening he was discovered with a rope holding up his pants. Every day being sub-“Casual Friday” was one of the few perks of the business. All that mattered to his employers was his packet of sublime medieval illuminations, delivered on time.

Cullen Murphy has had other notable successes as an editor, essayist and author, all presumably head-clearing pursuits that give him a valuable perspective lacking in those of us who rarely come up for air. I was especially moved by his modest appraisal of the ultimate significance of our profession: “Was it anything more noteworthy than bringing laughter (and adventure) to other human beings, while keeping the show on the road? What any civilization mostly needs is not the world-altering legacy of a few but the numberless people of talent who play a role … sustaining their contemporaries in the brief moment we have together.”

In Murphy’s reckoning, cartoonists are no more or less indispensable to society than the dentists and adjusters they evidently resemble. They simply play their part. Still, Murphy obviously knows how lucky he’s been: There are worse places to work than Camelot.",The Comic Strip’s Heyday in ‘Cartoon County’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/books/review/cartoon-county-cullen-murphy-memoir.html

Constructor Notes

LAURA: I’ve been solving crosswords all my life, it seems — my grandfather, who was an immigrant, would solve puzzles to practice English, and he used to ask for my help when I was a kid. I’ve only been constructing for about a year. I’m a librarian at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and Andrew Kingsley (a NYT constructor), who recently graduated, used to work on his grids in the reference room. We would chat about puzzles, and one day I decided that if puzzles were things that people made, I could make them too. I’ve been so fortunate to have friends and mentors who have supported me through the process of learning to construct. Recently, one of my favorite speculative fiction authors, Charlie Jane Anders, tweeted that a definition of success that makes her happy is “getting to be associated with people I admire, who keep surprising me.” That is also my definition of success in crosswords. Last winter when I started trying to make puzzles, I never imagined that within a year my first NYT byline would be shared with Erik Agard, whom I admire so much as a constructor and a person. Erik and I had been looking for ideas for co-constructing, and one day he emailed with this idea about names of body parts hidden in phrases, and thus ensued a 67-message email chain where the idea evolved, first to something with book titles, then to a meta idea, then finally to where it ended up with actor names. Some entries rejected from our final list included JIM [BACK]US, RED [BUTT]ONS, the nonspecific M[ORGAN] FREEMAN and someone with the awesome name of JACK [NOSE]WORTHY, who had a bit part in “Event Horizon.” ERIK: Laura is a true umptuple threat: solver (finished top-100 at Lollapuzzoola in her tournament debut), constructor (wrote a great puzzle for this year’s Boswords tournament), blogger (her reviews at Crossword Fiend and Rex Parker usually get a laugh out of me), community pillar (consistently an outspoken advocate for women and other underrepresented groups in crossword construction) … and she’s a kick-ass librarian and probably some other stuff I don’t even know about. She’s one of those people who can take your one pretty good idea and turn it into three great ideas; it was as much a pleasure to write this puzzle with her as it is a privilege to share her first NYT byline.

President Trump and his advisers have been dogged by revelations of undisclosed meetings, emails and phone calls between Russian officials and people connected to Mr. Trump during the campaign and presidential transition.

Some of Mr. Trump’s senior advisers denied knowing about any contacts with Russia. But new information indicates that several of them were aware of discussions, according to court documents and reporting.

It was also recently revealed that Donald Trump Jr. exchanged private messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy group that published Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers.

“The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight.
“I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said.","When Kwasi Boyd-Bouldin and his family migrated to Hollywood in 1980, they found a neighborhood of short brick apartment buildings, strip mall laundromats and liquor stores with bars on the windows and doors.

They had escaped from New York to California the romantic way, by train, three kids in their tweens and teens. They had fled Brownsville, Brooklyn, at a time the New York City was broke and dirty and crawling with mobsters.

Change was necessary. Also, Kwasi’s father had moved to Hollywood shortly after he was born. If they were going to have a relationship — and his mother wanted them to — they would have to live nearby. That this led them to the land of endless sun and countless movie stars made the move seem charmed, even magical.

Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, now 40, grew up on the streets of a humble neighborhood in Los Angeles that would eventually go bad. It would even claim one of his sisters during the crack era. But he still loved Hollywood. As a near-native, he rolled through the sun-bleached streets on his skateboard, taking in the scenery. He picked up his first camera, an Olympus Pen-F half-frame his dad left him, at 23, a trained observer of his cityscape. He’d studied the alleys and avenues, the angles of buildings against the sky, like Jane Goodall studied lowland gorillas.

These days, when he is not at his day job (as an education technology specialist at a Pasadena art school), Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who is married and has two daughters, is haunting the streets of his youth. “The Los Angeles Recordings,” his continuing documentary profile of his adopted hometown, serves as a visual introduction to his Hollywood, as he likes to say, among other fond places.

He began the project two years ago in reaction to the head-turning physical changes in the landscape that gentrification brought to the city — the same story playing out in cities across the country, from Seattle to Philadelphia.

The Los Angeles Recordings include photo essays from “South of the 10 Freeway,” “The Liquor Store,” “The Displacement Engine” and other aspects of a city transforming faster than generations of working-class and lower-middle-class residents can handle.

There is no glitz here; no glamour peeking from behind the palm trees against the short, squat locksmith or the auto body shop.

In part, he says, the project is his intention to document a vanishing L.A. Few who live outside it even know exists. He wants “to present a portrait of the city that reflects the lives of people who live in Los Angeles, as opposed to the glossy fictional version that dominates the mainstream narrative.”

“People are just being priced out, and the speed in which it is happening is unbelievable,” said Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who currently lives in Toluca Lake, a neighborhood near Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley.

“Visually,” he said, “the landscape of the area is being transformed as well because many of the complexes being erected are so large they completely alter the skyline.

Photo

Most, if not all, of the complexes being built cater to the affluent, so they are unattainable to the people they are displacing.”

For his Hollywood portrait, the landscapes are stripped of clutter — for the most part, he leaves people out of the frame. In his Hollywood, short, square cinder box buildings with signs for muffler repair, locksmiths, cobblers, and the iconic liquor store are recorded for posterity like the last of endangered species. He eschews the easy shot, the construction cranes behind the vacant lots where aging apartments once stood. Mr. Boyd-Bouldin’s portrait is of an old familial Hollywood that is here today but may be gone tomorrow. The sun-washed skies and lonely streets give some images a dreamy, faraway tone.

As he describes them: “From an outside perspective, some may see only vacant lots and other signs of urban decay. But it’s important to take a more critical look at these areas.”

What he is trying to do, he says, is to not only document the transformation but to provide insight into the impact these changes have had on the city. To what end, he is not sure. “The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight. “I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said. “It’s the city and place that made me who I am today.”

On Monday morning, police searched a six-story apartment building where Mr. Ullah may have lived with his parents on Ocean Parkway, as well as two other residences.
Mr. Ullah is a permanent United States resident, according to Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, having arrived in 2011.

Police released a photo of Mr. Ullah that appeared to have been taken inside the subway walkway after the blast. In it, he is curled in a fetal position; his exposed stomach is blackened.

Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself for the second time in two months calming the city after a terrorist attack, in this case, on the system that moves millions of people across the city every day.

“Our lives revolve around the subway,” he said at a news conference on Eighth Avenue a few hours after the incident. “The choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world. And we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.”

“The terrorists want to undermine that,” the mayor added. “They yearn to attack New York City.”

Investigators, led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, believe Mr. Ullah acted alone, but they only have just begun to review materials from the searches and other leads.

Christina Bethea was in the underground walkway, headed to her job as a security guard, when the explosion nearly knocked her over, sending a haze of smoke into the corridor packed with commuters. She did not see where it came from, she said. “As soon as we heard ‘boom!’ we began to run,” she said. An hour after the attack, she stood outside the bus terminal, calling her mother and father in North Carolina to tell them she was O.K. “I feel good,” Ms. Bethea said. “I am alive!”

All morning, thwarted travelers spilled into the streets of Times Square, towing suitcases in bewildered silence. They gathered at police cordons stretched across the city’s most trafficked thoroughfares, boulevards vacant at the height of the holiday season, and filmed the red lights of scores of emergency vehicles.

On Monday morning, police searched a six-story apartment building where Mr. Ullah may have lived with his parents on Ocean Parkway, as well as two other residences. At around 11 a.m. officers led a woman in a dark coat from the Ocean Parkway home, a gray hijab covering her hair, into a patrol car, and sped off. The area is home to a few thousand Bangladeshi-born residents, and it represents the heart of their Brooklyn community, with stores and mosques built along Church Avenue.

Mr. Ullah is a permanent United States resident, according to Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, having arrived in 2011.

The method of attack — self-detonation, or the attempt at least — introduces something of a new element to a long history of the city as target, a place that has yet somehow avoided the bomb-wearing attackers that are the hallmark of terrorism in places like Israel and Nigeria.

Since the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, there have been about 26 terrorist plots against the city that officials have identified as being thwarted “through intelligence, investigation and interdiction,” John J. Miller, the Police Department’s commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference on Monday.

But more recently, the string of foiled plots gave way to closer calls.

In 2009, law enforcement authorities prevented a cell of people with ties to operatives of Al Qaeda from carrying out plans to bomb subway trains. A year later, in May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant, tried to detonate a truck with explosives in Times Square — but his devices did not go off.

In September 2016, a crude homemade explosive crafted from a pressure cooker packed with shrapnel was left on 27th Street in Chelsea, exploding but killing no one. Before Monday, the last attack was on Halloween, when a man spurred by Islamic State propaganda drove a rental truck down a bicycle path on Manhattan’s West Side, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The man, Sayfullo Saipov, was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors; he has pleaded not guilty.

While no formal announcement had been made, both federal and local law enforcement officials indicated that Mr. Ullah would be prosecuted in federal court in Manhattan by the office of the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim.

But by Monday afternoon, the city was busy forgetting. On 42nd Street, tourists strolled unperturbed, or hurried into the reopened bus depot to catch their rides.

Just hours before, John Frank had stood on that street by the Port Authority exit when he felt tremors through the pavement. “That’s how strong it was,” said Mr. Frank, 54. Shaken, he fled a flew blocks away, and stood for a few long minutes, leaning against a garbage can for support.

“In New York City, we are vulnerable to a lot of things,” Mr. Frank said. “These incidents are happening too frequently.”

“You’re always asked these questions,” she says. “And often I find it difficult to send them places that are reasonable — middle-ground but really well-made pieces.”

So along with her partner of 10 years, the Australian designer Josh Goot, Centenera decided to design the solution: Wardrobe NYC, an edited collection of high-quality basics for men and women, which launches online tomorrow.

The full collection features only 16 pieces: eight for men and eight for women, the basis for what Goot and Centenera feel is a simple, unimpeachable wardrobe that would work for people in many different professions, regardless of personal styles, ages and body types. (Many of the pieces are cut generously and range in sizes; their men’s T-shirt, for one, runs from small to 3XL.) The men’s collection includes a roomy overcoat, a two-button blazer, a T-shirt, a pair of loosefitting trousers and a hoodie; for women, there is also a gloriously big coat, a white collarless shirt, black leggings, an A-line skirt and more. Everything is black or white — a palette Goot calls “democratic” and “solutions-based.” Together, the clothes seem like the kinds of things you’d want to wear so often, you might be inspired to purge your closet of everything else.

“This is our way of saying to people, this season, this is what we think you should be wearing,” Centenera says, as the couple share a couch in their light-filled NoHo loft, pieces from the new collection hanging on a rack nearby. “Being authoritative is our way of providing a solution for people. I think that is a huge solution for people to get on with their lives and not having to be so challenged by what and how to put things together.”

The collection is produced entirely in Italy and will be sold exclusively on the brand’s site. For both men and women, the entire eight-piece wardrobe costs $3,000; also available is a four-piece “core” wardrobe ($1,500) which consists, for women, of a blazer, a T-shirt, a button-down and a skirt, and for men, of a blazer, a button-down, a T-shirt and trousers.

Caviar and truffles are all well and good, but nothing says “I’m pampering my guests” quite like a tray of hot, crisp gougères straight from the oven.

It isn’t because these French cheese puffs are expensive to make. They’re not. A humble mix of grated cheese, butter and flour, they’re among the thriftiest tidbits on the hors d’oeuvres circuit. Nor are they difficult — though if you don’t have an electric mixer, some muscle will be required to beat the eggs into the stiff batter.

Photo

But there’s a certain amount of planning needed both in terms of timing and oven space to serve them while they’re still piping hot — or at least still very warm. That’s when their buttery, cheesy charm is at its most pronounced. Putting this kind of planning into action amid the swirling chaotic bustle of the average holiday cocktail party (at least, my average holiday cocktail party) is what I mean by pampering, albeit in an understated way.

The upside of serving gougères at a party is that you can make them ahead and freeze them before baking. Then, as your guests are unwrapping themselves from scarves and hats and winter coats, simply pop them, frozen, into the oven. By the time the drinks are poured, you’ll be able to pass around a steaming tray for immediate nibbling.

Photo

Plain gougères are wonderful, but the cheese puffs also take well to variations. You can change up the cheeses, as long as you always sprinkle some extra on top to bake up into a salty brown crust. Chiles, cracked pepper or spices add verve. Whole-wheat or rye flour reduces the puffiness slightly, but adds a lovely earthy, nutty flavor. Or, you can add intensely flavored, minced bits like herbs, garlic, capers and olives. Here, I use a combination of crisp pancetta and sage, but basil and olives would be lovely if you’re going for something vaguely Provençal. And so on.

If you can work fast or find a helper, you can fill your gougères with all kinds of tasty mixes. Slice them open while they’re still hot enough to burn your fingers, and spoon or pipe in the likes of smoked fish mousse, pimento cheese, dollops of chicken, or lobster salad. Or try filling them with a spoonful of crème fraîche topped by an even larger one of caviar — and pamper your guests to the extreme.

Stories often dwell on the gentrifying neighborhood’s property sales or the latest murder in the 40th precinct.

With coverage like that, it’s easy to forget that people live, love and grow up there.

In “Haven,” the photographer Sarah Blesener looks beyond the headlines, capturing a group of neighborhood boys coming of age. Her images defy the one-dimensional stereotype of “young boys in the Bronx.” No gang signs or bandanas, no flashing of guns, no clutched Hennessy bottles or blunts. Just kids.

Photo

Kids who cram into their mothers’ couches and text, who sit on each other’s beds like it’s their own, who spot each other a few quarters for chips and soda, who get nervous talking to their crush. They live in housing projects within walking distance of each other. Members of their family have been incarcerated, and they live in fear of being arrested themselves, as well as being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Their demeanors balance maturity and boyishness in a way those who live outside their neighborhood don’t necessarily get.

Ms. Blesener was born and raised in Minnesota and has only spent a few years in New York. One day, she was shooting a portrait of Chavi, 14, the first boy in the group she met through a friend at ICP, where she is a student. Chavi dreams of being a bachata star like another Bronx kid done good, Romeo Santos. After releasing a new single and asking Ms. Blesener for a portrait, she suggested they go up to a rooftop to get a panorama of the Bronx. Chavi was nervous, and after a few shots, asked to go back downstairs. Ms. Blesener didn’t understand why. He spelled it out for her: She can afford to get into trouble, he told her, but he can’t. “It really sucks that he has to be so aware of that at such a young age,” she said.

There are other things Chavi and his boys are aware of, too, like their neighborhood changing almost daily with expensive apartments, new cafes, restaurants and galleries. “They are all afraid of being left behind,” said Ms. Blesener, who recounted how she’d often make the walk with them down Third Avenue, and they’d stop and point out signs of gentrification: new businesses, shuttered ones, unfamiliar faces. In one photograph, they play softball in a field not far from Yankee Stadium. Behind them, a new construction project looms.

Photo

When Ms. Blesener met Chavi and his four friends as freshmen in high school, they were so shy they’d barely swear around her. Then she spent time with them, met their families and their girlfriends and they opened up. They are juniors now, experiencing their first breakups, their voices changing, and the feeling of being too cool to talk to anyone as openly as they once did.

Ms. Blesener said she plans to continue to photograph the boys until they are seniors in high school. The culmination, she hopes, will paint a different image of what it means to grow up in a neighborhood like Mott Haven.

“There’s nothing but bad statements about the place, especially when it comes to teenagers,” she said. “But these kids are really set on defying that. They don’t want to be put in those types of boxes.”

Jessica Chastain received news of her Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a dramatic feature while promoting that film, “Molly’s Game,” in Paris. Directed by Aaron Sorkin, the film tells the true story of Molly Bloom, a world-class skier who began running high-stakes, celebrity-magnet poker games. Speaking by phone shortly before she was due to fly to Amsterdam, Ms. Chastain said the Globe nomination was especially gratifying because she had been outspoken about recent sexual harassment accusations and had worried that she would face industry repercussions.

This is your fifth Golden Globe nomination. Do you feel like an old hand?

Not at all. The first, I think, was for the ceremony in 2012, for “The Help.” I struggled for so long to try to create a career. To have five nominations in such a short amount of time, it’s really shocking, and more than I ever imagined. I just feel so much gratitude and happiness.

“Molly’s Game” is an Aaron Sorkin film with acres and acres of dialogue. Was that daunting?

I feel everything I had ever done prepared me. This is a dream for an actress. It’s not normal for a film to really rely on what a female character says. I understood the importance of that. I understood the importance of doing an Aaron Sorkin film. He’s a political filmmaker. This is a film about gender politics, patriarchy. You see it with Molly’s father, and in her family, and in her industry and in the government. This was an issue 50 years ago, and now, because it’s in the newspapers, everyone’s interested. It’s always interested me, what women do to navigate patriarchy. To me Aaron’s always been a filmmaker with a sense of justice and idealism. When I got this script, it was something I was waiting for my whole life, to be able to sink my teeth into a female character like this.

How did you prepare?

I wanted to be filmable perfect for Aaron Sorkin. I worked with Molly, she’s very different than I am and very much a sensual being. I don’t see myself in that way at all. I spent a lot of time talking with her, and observing how she presents herself in the world. I talked to players who played in her game, and went to a New York game and observed what that room is like. There were women going around and massaging men and getting apple pie or chicken noodle soup if the guys were hungry.

By sensual, do you mean in the luscious ’50s film star kind of way?

We live in society that values women for their sexual desirability. In the beginning of the film, many men tell Molly she needs to change what she looks like. She’s told her dress is ugly and to buy new shoes. Molly had to put this mask on, of this uber sexual being. For the guys to listen to her, to acknowledge her, to see her, she in a way had to objectify herself. And what I appreciated was I never felt objectified in the story. It was the first time I every worked with a [female cinematographer, Charlotte Bruus Christensen]. Aaron said from the very beginning he didn’t want the film to have a male gaze, because it’s Molly’s story. It was the first time on set, wearing these kinds of clothes, where I felt in control of my own body.

The independent arbiter would then make a nonbinding proposal addressing what happened and what should be done. It could include a call to resign or for censure, or a range of other responses tailored to the findings.

This isn’t just about Senator Franken. Other lawmakers have also been accused of harassment. We need a system to deal with that messy reality, and the current one of investigating those complaints is opaque, takes too long and has not worked to protect vulnerable women and men from harassment. And the current alternative — off with the head of the accused, regardless of the accusation — is too quick, too easily subject to political manipulation and too vulnerable to the passions of the moment.

We don’t have the system I’m suggesting. But that doesn’t mean we should give up on process. On Nov. 30, a Senate ethics panel announced the beginning of an investigation into the allegations against Senator Franken. It should run its course, and we should see the results. Then we’ll know whether his planned resignation was warranted.

With time, and the existing ethics procedures, things are likely to emerge that will surprise us all. New facts may put Senator Franken in a better light, or a far worse one, and we should be open to both.

Elections are different. Voters have a responsibility to make a judgment with whatever facts are available on Election Day. In the case of Roy Moore, voters in Alabama ought take the very serious accusations into account. But if Mr. Moore is elected to the Senate, he should immediately be subject to the same kind of ethics inquiry that I am recommending for Senator Franken.

Finally, the nature of the behaviors matter, too. Proportionality means that after investigating, Congress should fully consider the best response to the revealed conduct.

My first job out of law school was representing people on death row in North Carolina, where I often saw the impact of hasty prosecutions. I represented a man on death row whose lawyers had spent all of eight hours looking into his claim of innocence. I met men whose lawyers had never looked into their backgrounds. I also lived in the legal environment that produced the Duke University lacrosse case, in which three students were falsely accused of rape by the prosecutor in the case, who was later disbarred for his conduct. The quick rush to public condemnation of the players, fueled by the media, ended up hurting the accuser and the accused.

The New Health Care People Don’t Take Their Pills. Only One Thing Seems to Help. High-tech approaches and “reminder” packaging don’t work well. Reducing prices does.

For all that Americans spend on prescription drugs — $425 billion last year — you’d think we’d actually take our medicine.

But one of the frustrating truths about American health care is that half or more of prescribed medication is never taken.

It’s called medication nonadherence, and it’s a well-documented and longstanding problem, particularly for patients with chronic conditions. The drugs they’re prescribed are intended to prevent costly complications, reduce hospitalization, even keep them alive. But even when the stakes are high, many patients don’t take their meds.

This seems like a problem we ought to be able to solve. It motivates high tech approaches, like digital pills that can automatically communicate to doctors that they’ve been taken.

Maybe people forget to take their meds — about 60 percent of people say as much — so we just need to remind them. Maybe people don’t understand the value of what they’re prescribed, so we just need to educate them. Maybe drug regimens are too complex, so we just need to simplify dosing.

All these methods have been tried. It’s not so clear any of them work very well.

Only one approach has repeatedly been shown to be effective: reducing the cost of medications.

First, let’s look at the research on the other methods. So-called reminder packaging — pill packaging or containers that organize drugs by single dose or day of the week — is a relatively simple idea intended to help people remember to take their prescribed dose.

A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that it was helpful in doing so, but only modestly. Surveying 12 randomized controlled trials, the authors concluded that reminder packaging increased the number of pills taken by patients by 11 percentage points. But they also found that most of the studies had significant methodological flaws, casting doubt on the findings. Other systematic reviews of reminder packaging studies also found problems with the research, like small sample sizes and short follow-up periods.

Perhaps reminder packaging is too passive, and patients need something like an alarm to alert them when they’ve missed a dose. Electronic pill monitors can do that. Some just remind patients to take their medication. More sophisticated ones alert doctors when they don’t. In 2014, a team of researchers from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School published a systematic review of such devices in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Here, too, the results are disappointing. Most studies of such devices do not detect improvement in adherence.

A recent randomized trial not included in these systematic reviews tested three dose reminder approaches for people with a chronic health condition or depression: a pill bottle with toggles for each day of the week that can be changed after each daily dose; a pill bottle cap with a digital timer displaying the time elapsed since the medication was last taken; and a pill organizer with a compartment for every day of the week. Over 50,000 subjects were assigned randomly to one of these approaches or to none, as a control.

None of the devices performed better than the control in getting patients to take their medications. One possible explanation is that forgetfulness may not be why patients don’t take their medications as prescribed. Drug costs, a wish to avoid side effects, and a desire to be less reliant on drugs are some of the other reasons patients don’t take them.

“It is also possible that for reminder devices to be effective, they need to be coupled with other adherence-improvement strategies,” said Niteesh Choudhry, lead author of the study and a physician with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

That’s why augmenting electronic monitoring with other information or assistance delivered to patients may be more successful, if more expensive. For example, one study found that the adherence of hypertensive patients increased when digital display containers were combined with a blood pressure cuff and a card for recording blood pressure. This suggests that when patients receive feedback that signals how well they are controlling their condition, they may be more willing to take their medication.

Still, it isn’t hard to find studies that show that even with considerable support, getting patients to take medications can be challenging. A Cochrane review examined randomized controlled trials of interventions — across many dimensions — to increase medication adherence. Reminder packaging and alarms were just some of the methods assessed, with approaches including patient and family education about the value of medication, and mail or telephone follow-up.

Of the 182 randomized trials reviewed, four stood out as the most methodologically sound. Among those, two increased adherence but two did not. Over all, the authors concluded that there was a lack of convincing evidence that even complex and costly interventions significantly increased patients’ compliance with drug regimens.

“A cure for nonadherence is nowhere to be seen,” they wrote. A more recent study not included in the Cochrane review found that not even providing patients with financial incentives and social support, along with pill bottles that signal when a dose should be taken, was enough to boost adherence among heart attack survivors.

So why is price so important?

When drugs cost them less, patients are more likely to fill prescriptions. Even if people have already purchased drugs, they may skip doses — or split the pills — because of concerns that they won’t be able to afford future refills. Free drugs don’t get everyone to take them, but many more do so than if they have to pay for them.

For those with certain chronic conditions, extra help in affording medications can reduce adverse events and hospitalizations — a big increase in quality of life, as well as a potential benefit to the wider health care system and the economy.

Lowering prescription drug costs has been a longstanding pursuit for many politicians, and Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act helped (although most Americans still say costs are too high). President Trump said drug companies “have been getting away with murder,” but lower drug costs have not yet been a top priority of this White House.

Keeping track of dolphins is a slippery, patchy process. First, you must procure time on a ship or aircraft, which is expensive. After that, what you see depends on uncontrollable factors like weather, ocean conditions and whether the creatures happen to be hanging out at the sea’s surface.

As an alternative, researchers have tried deploying underwater sensors to eavesdrop on the clicks dolphins use for echolocation, which can give clues about the aquatic mammals’ numbers, distributions and behaviors. Sifting through all these data, however, becomes a new headache.

A machine learning program — similar to the one that recommends new Facebook friends to you — may be able to help. In a study published Thursday in PLOS Computational Biology, scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California introduced an algorithm that was able to analyze 52 million dolphin clicks and identify seven distinct groups of sound. These click types, the authors speculate, may correspond to different kinds of dolphins.

Like many good science stories, this one was the result of grad student misery. Soon after Kait Frasier started her Ph.D. in the Whale Acoustic Lab at Scripps, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill happened. Wanting to monitor how dolphins were doing after the spill, she and colleagues placed acoustic sensors around the Gulf of Mexico. It was Dr. Frasier’s job to go through the mountains of data and identify dolphin clicks.

“I tried for many years to really wrap my head around patterns in the dolphin signals,” said Dr. Frasier, who is now an assistant project scientist at Scripps. “I could get somewhere, but it took a long time and was kind of subjective.”

She wondered if she could leverage the machine learning techniques used by Google and Facebook — “tools literally designed for big data,” she said — to improve on the painstaking process.

The method she and her collaborators developed worked in steps. First, a detection program scanned through years of audio recordings and pulled out all segments with dolphin clicks. Their algorithm then carved these segments into five-minute blocks, generating an average click rate and frequency shape for each time window.

Next, the program grouped together five-minute chunks with similar average click rates and frequency profiles. It worked much like the online algorithms that recommend social media contacts, music or advertisements to us, though in a much simpler way, Dr. Frasier said.

While it previously took her three weeks to analyze a year’s worth of recordings from a single site, the algorithm took about four days to sort through two years of data from five sites.

Through an “unsupervised” process — meaning the authors did not train the algorithm to recognize any particular categories beforehand — the program came up with seven discrete click clusters.

One of these was consistent with the unusual click profile of a species called Risso’s dolphin, which was a “good sanity check” suggesting their method might work, Dr. Frasier said.

She and her collaborators also speculated that two of the other click types possibly belonged to short-finned pilot whales and false killer whales, both members of the oceanic dolphin family that live in the Gulf of Mexico.

The machine learning approach has exciting potential, but field studies are needed to check their algorithm’s predictions, said Shannon Gowans, a professor of biology and marine science at Eckerd College in Florida, who was not involved in the study.

For now, the researchers can’t rule out the possibility that their click types come from other factors, such as dolphins altering the sounds they make based on context, or signals being captured differently at varying distances and angles from the sensors, Dr. Frasier acknowledged.

But she’s passionate about this technology’s future. Improving scientists’ ability to track dolphin populations is not just a matter of helping dolphins, she said. Along with other marine mammals, dolphins reflect overall ocean health, meaning researchers can use them as a window into understanding changing ocean conditions.

“My goal is that we free ourselves up to ask more interesting questions,” she said. “If we can spend less time manually picking through data and assigning labels, we can start looking at the bigger picture.”

Pressed by Congress and tax policy experts to prove the Trump administration’s claims that its $1.5 trillion tax cut would pay for itself by stimulating economic growth, the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy released a one-page memo that shows it can’t do it.

It projects a budget surplus created by 2.9 percent annual growth in gross domestic product over 10 years — that’s more than 50 percent faster than the most recent forecast by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Half of that growth would come from corporate tax cuts, the other half from other tax cuts and regulatory reform and from “infrastructure development and welfare reform,” neither of which has advanced past the talking stage.

Scott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, called the one-pager “a thought experiment on how federal revenues would vary under different economic effects of overall government policies. Which is, needless to say, an odd way to analyze a tax bill.”

Several high-profile television anchors have been fired from their jobs after being accused of inappropriate touching, exposing themselves or assaulting women in the workplace.

Allegations of sexual assault against Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, have roiled the special election in that state, where voting is to take place on Tuesday.

This month, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, called on the president to step down because of a track record of “horrific conduct” with women. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said on Sunday that the president “has been accused by many women of assault” and urged him to consider resigning the way that Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, agreed to do after multiple allegations of inappropriate behavior. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, told Vice News on Sunday that the accusations by the women against Mr. Trump were “far more damning.”

White House officials on Monday repeated the president’s claim that the accusations of sexual misconduct were false and that the women were lying.

“The president has directly responded and said that these allegations are false and that’s what I’m doing in relaying that information to you,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters. Asked whether Congress should investigate, Ms. Sanders noted that voters had already made a judgment about the allegations.

“This took place long before he was elected to be president,” Ms. Sanders said. “And the people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump, and we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.”

The women accusing the president originally came forward, along with several others, in October 2016 after reports emerged of Mr. Trump talking crudely on an “Access Hollywood” recording. Mr. Trump admitted to making the comments on the tape, and apologized for them, but he vehemently denied the allegations of misconduct and harassment by the other women.

After Mr. Trump’s victory on Election Day, interest waned in the allegations. Several of the women said on Monday that they were angry that their decision to tell their stories did not initially seem to be taken seriously.

“It was heartbreaking last year,” Ms. Holvey said on the NBC program. “We are private citizens and for us to put ourselves out there, to try to show America who this man is, and especially how he views women, for them to say, ‘Meh, we don’t care,’ it hurt.”

It remains to be seen whether the women will now be treated differently. Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and a prominent woman in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, broke with White House talking points on Sunday when she said that the president’s accusers “should be heard” and should feel free to come forward — even though the election was over.

“I know that he was elected,” Ms. Haley said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”

At the White House, Ms. Sanders responded to a question about Ms. Haley’s comments by saying that the president agreed — in generic terms — that “it’s a good thing that women are coming forward” to tell their stories about harassment.

But she said that “he also feels strongly that a mere allegation shouldn’t determine the course,” and she repeated Mr. Trump’s belief that his victory in the election should be the end of the story.

“I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said.","When Kwasi Boyd-Bouldin and his family migrated to Hollywood in 1980, they found a neighborhood of short brick apartment buildings, strip mall laundromats and liquor stores with bars on the windows and doors.

They had escaped from New York to California the romantic way, by train, three kids in their tweens and teens. They had fled Brownsville, Brooklyn, at a time the New York City was broke and dirty and crawling with mobsters.

Change was necessary. Also, Kwasi’s father had moved to Hollywood shortly after he was born. If they were going to have a relationship — and his mother wanted them to — they would have to live nearby. That this led them to the land of endless sun and countless movie stars made the move seem charmed, even magical.

Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, now 40, grew up on the streets of a humble neighborhood in Los Angeles that would eventually go bad. It would even claim one of his sisters during the crack era. But he still loved Hollywood. As a near-native, he rolled through the sun-bleached streets on his skateboard, taking in the scenery. He picked up his first camera, an Olympus Pen-F half-frame his dad left him, at 23, a trained observer of his cityscape. He’d studied the alleys and avenues, the angles of buildings against the sky, like Jane Goodall studied lowland gorillas.

These days, when he is not at his day job (as an education technology specialist at a Pasadena art school), Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who is married and has two daughters, is haunting the streets of his youth. “The Los Angeles Recordings,” his continuing documentary profile of his adopted hometown, serves as a visual introduction to his Hollywood, as he likes to say, among other fond places.

He began the project two years ago in reaction to the head-turning physical changes in the landscape that gentrification brought to the city — the same story playing out in cities across the country, from Seattle to Philadelphia.

The Los Angeles Recordings include photo essays from “South of the 10 Freeway,” “The Liquor Store,” “The Displacement Engine” and other aspects of a city transforming faster than generations of working-class and lower-middle-class residents can handle.

There is no glitz here; no glamour peeking from behind the palm trees against the short, squat locksmith or the auto body shop.

In part, he says, the project is his intention to document a vanishing L.A. Few who live outside it even know exists. He wants “to present a portrait of the city that reflects the lives of people who live in Los Angeles, as opposed to the glossy fictional version that dominates the mainstream narrative.”

“People are just being priced out, and the speed in which it is happening is unbelievable,” said Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who currently lives in Toluca Lake, a neighborhood near Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley.

“Visually,” he said, “the landscape of the area is being transformed as well because many of the complexes being erected are so large they completely alter the skyline.

Photo

Most, if not all, of the complexes being built cater to the affluent, so they are unattainable to the people they are displacing.”

For his Hollywood portrait, the landscapes are stripped of clutter — for the most part, he leaves people out of the frame. In his Hollywood, short, square cinder box buildings with signs for muffler repair, locksmiths, cobblers, and the iconic liquor store are recorded for posterity like the last of endangered species. He eschews the easy shot, the construction cranes behind the vacant lots where aging apartments once stood. Mr. Boyd-Bouldin’s portrait is of an old familial Hollywood that is here today but may be gone tomorrow. The sun-washed skies and lonely streets give some images a dreamy, faraway tone.

As he describes them: “From an outside perspective, some may see only vacant lots and other signs of urban decay. But it’s important to take a more critical look at these areas.”

What he is trying to do, he says, is to not only document the transformation but to provide insight into the impact these changes have had on the city. To what end, he is not sure. “The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight. “I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said. “It’s the city and place that made me who I am today.”

“Our relationship with death is intimate,” Octavio Paz, Mexico’s most celebrated 20th-century poet, wrote about his country in the classic book “The Labyrinth of Solitude.” “More intimate, perhaps, than any other people.”

Death is everywhere in Mexico. In the bodies of the victims of powerful drug cartels, in the way the Mexican police disappear groups of protesting students, in the methods used by corrupt politicians to discard journalists.

Death is with the Mexican who jumps over a border wall chasing a dream for a better life, with the families caring for the elderly with no health insurance and with the struggling farmworkers who labor under dangerous conditions.

For Mexicans, death is earthly. We build altars in our homes with framed photos of the departed next to candles, fruit, bread and candy. This intimacy with death brings with it a certain acceptance. Death is even celebrated.

In sharp contrast, Americans approach death with fear. They avoid speaking about it. They try to hide it. Or they turn it into a theater of horror, which is projected through cultural events like Halloween, where the dead are made into monsters.

Pixar’s new animated movie “Coco” is a sumptuous portrait of Mexico’s infatuation with the afterlife. Hollywood has gotten Mexican life wrong so many times — think “Under the Volcano” and “Traffic” — that Mexicans have stopped caring. But “Coco” feels fresh and authentic, perhaps the most sophisticated representation of Mexican popular culture ever produced for the big screen. It makes no excuses about Mexicans’ intimacy with death. On the contrary, it turns death into an amusement-park ride.

Most of the plot takes place during the Día de los Muertos, a holiday when Mexicans spend 24 hours in the cemetery, making “ofrendas” (gifts) to deceased family members. I have participated in this celebration several times, in Mexico as well as in border towns on the American side. The most striking element is the omnipresence of ghosts.

In Anglo-Protestant culture, ghosts are menacing types who come with an unwelcome message (like Hamlet’s father). In Mexico, spirits are gentle, even lovable, always ready to offer counsel. No fright, no haunted houses. We greet them with music and dance and plenty of conversation.

This is not to say that death in Mexico is innocuous. In Aztec mythology, two deities of death, Mictlantecuhtli and Mictecacihuatl, rule the underworld, which is known as Mictlan. A recently deceased person navigates through the nine levels of Mictlan with the help of Xolotl, a kind of Virgil who is the double of the powerful deity Quetzalcoatl and also has the job of protecting the sun in the underworld.

The odyssey takes four years and presents all sorts of challenges, including passing through a place where the wind blows knives and another with a river of blood surrounded by jaguars. It is a purifying journey across the landscape of memory, a search for one’s lineage and a dialogue with the dead.

Miguel, the 12-year-old protagonist of “Coco,” embarks on such a quest. Along with his companion, a stray dog fittingly named Dante, he treks through the underworld while facing obstacles and bad omens that pop up constantly. (In Spanish “coco” means “boogeyman,” which is a nickname for the devil.) But since this is a children’s movie, the challenges bring laughter, which isn’t altogether alien to Mexico’s approach to death. To laugh at death in Mexico is to be courageous.

Miguel’s ordeal is about sacrifice — one of the most important ways that Mexicans engage with the idea of the end of life. One sacrifices for all sorts of things: the good of the family, the good of the nation and the good of the almighty. An honorable life for Mexicans is a life of sacrifice, even martyrdom. Through sacrifice, Miguel learns not to silence death, not to be ashamed of it.

The ultimate symbol of Mexico’s intimacy with death are the “calaveras” — depictions of skulls (and sometimes skeletons) — and “Coco” pays tribute to this rich artistic tradition. Calaveras’ roots date back to pre-Columbian civilizations, who included skulls and skeletons in temples, sculptures, architecture, and even on currency.

In modern times, the man credited for popularizing them is José Guadalupe Posada, a famous late-19th-century engraver. During the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Posada poked fun at dictators and the bourgeoisie in general, most often by depicting calaveras dressed up as tyrants and wealthy people, while portraying the downtrodden in a dignified fashion.

Mexican artists have built on Posada’s work. Diego Rivera, for instance, included skeletons in his murals (such as “Dream of a Sunday Afternoon at the Alameda Central Park,” where Posada himself makes a cameo) and other paintings. And of course, calaveras are the leitmotif in Frida Kahlo’s self-portraits. Today, it is next to impossible to enter a supermarket, a restaurant, a school or any other public space in Mexico without being greeted by them.

Along with the film’s embrace of the afterlife, the use of Spanglish dialogue is a refreshing surprise. Even indigenous terms like “chamaco” (rascal), which has Aztec roots, felt natural in the New York theater where I saw it. The actors rolled their r’s without hesitation. In short, instead of hiding their heritage, the characters emphasize and even make fun of it.

This is particularly welcome at a time when President Trump disparages Mexicans to score political points and when Mexico-United States relations are at a low point. Maybe it’s a sign that the dead are looking out for us.

I loved this theme. Perhaps a bit tough for a Tuesday, but an occasional challenge is always nice. After all, we do crosswords to stretch our brains, and the reinterpretation of phrases like these has us doing just that. HAT TIPS are in order for Mr. Smith and Ms. Burnikel.

Tricky Clues

32A: The “buds” in the clue “They come with buds” had me thinking about flowers and friends first. However, the correct answer is IPODS, which come with earbuds.

39A: Occasionally, some clue-answer combinations are tough from the answers themselves, even though the clue is quite descriptive. SAD DAY didn’t come to mind immediately, though how else could it have been clued for a Tuesday audience? This is its second appearance in The Times.

5D: A Times debut that surprised me, as I filled it right in the grid without crossers. Were you familiar with SUE BEE?

23D: I had no idea what cane blades were, but this is a great example of where pattern recognition is just as valuable as an expansive trivia background. Let’s say you saw this clue, and only knew that the answer was O _ _ E. How many other musical instruments do you know that follow this letter pattern? You should be able to tentatively fill in OBOE and then check your crossers; perhaps guessing on that second O will help you figure out ORB at 33A.

25D: Hot MICS “can cause trouble” by allowing people to hear comments that you didn’t intend to make publicly. “Mics” are short for “microphones.”

57D: You always have to be careful in deciding between AAH and AHH. Here, even if you were unfamiliar with 62A, OH HENRY looks much more plausible than OAHENRY.

Constructor Notes

Harry Smith: Late last winter, NBC News producer Kori Lynch wanted to know if I had any interest in doing a story on Will Shortz and the 75th anniversary of the Times Crossword. As a fan, I could not pass up the opportunity. We covered the big puzzle competition in Connecticut which Will started and still runs. [This is the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. See you there in a few months? —S.E.] And eventually made it to his home for the big interview. The place is a riot. There are stacks of ancient newspapers. Piles of puzzle books. Artifacts and ephemera from his lifetime as a enigmatologist. And then there are the submissions. Hundreds of envelopes from around the country. Each with a puzzle inside. All waiting for Will to determine if they are worthy of the paper. As our interview was concluding, Will asked me if I wanted to take a crack at creating an anniversary crossword for the Times. I panicked. The puzzle is a mirthful meditation. A secular, sacred safe space where the rest of the world does not encroach. I eventually said yes. And soon realized my panic was unfounded. Will put me in touch with Zhouqin Burnikel and we quickly set to work. First she said Will would want three themes. And so began a flurry of phone calls and email messages — a weekend’s worth, in fact. I’d propose something and Zhouqin instantly knew if it worked or did not. “Nose for gnus” did not. The process was a blast. It was raw wordplay, simultaneously exhilarating and gleefully frustrating. When Zhouqin was satisfied with the themes, we sent them off to Will. Will sent back his thoughts and Zhouqin set out to build the rest of the grid. At which point she sent it to me and assigned me to write the rest of the clues. It honestly saddened me to complete the puzzle. The process was that much fun. So a big thank you to Will and Zhouqin. It has been an honor to be asked to do this. A highlight of the year without question. And for the record: My wife, NBC sportscaster Andrea Joyce, is the truly devoted puzzle person in our household. As the puzzles get harder through the week, she routinely leaves me in the dust. Zhouqin Burnikel: This puzzle was made last April. Immediately after Will introduced us, Harry sent me a few ideas. We eventually settled on today’s theme set, with Will’s help. Harry was so warm, quick and creative. I was also surprised that he speaks some Chinese. He knows pijiu (beer), mei wen ti (no problem), etc. It’s such an honor to work with a news legend.

Congratulations on your debut, Mr. Smith! Thanks to both you and Ms. Burnikel for a memorable Tuesday offering.

On Monday morning, police searched a six-story apartment building where Mr. Ullah may have lived with his parents on Ocean Parkway, as well as two other residences.
Mr. Ullah is a permanent United States resident, according to Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, having arrived in 2011.
“That’s how strong it was,” said Mr. Frank, 54.
“In New York City, we are vulnerable to a lot of things,” Mr. Frank said.","“These officers went into this situation blind, only becoming aware of the danger involved once they confronted the suspect,” Mr. Egbert said.

Police released a photo of Mr. Ullah that appeared to have been taken inside the subway walkway after the blast. In it, he is curled in a fetal position; his exposed stomach is blackened.

Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself for the second time in two months calming the city after a terrorist attack, in this case, on the system that moves millions of people across the city every day.

“Our lives revolve around the subway,” he said at a news conference on Eighth Avenue a few hours after the incident. “The choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world. And we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.”

“The terrorists want to undermine that,” the mayor added. “They yearn to attack New York City.”

Investigators, led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, believe Mr. Ullah acted alone, but they only have just begun to review materials from the searches and other leads.

Christina Bethea was in the underground walkway, headed to her job as a security guard, when the explosion nearly knocked her over, sending a haze of smoke into the corridor packed with commuters. She did not see where it came from, she said. “As soon as we heard ‘boom!’ we began to run,” she said. An hour after the attack, she stood outside the bus terminal, calling her mother and father in North Carolina to tell them she was O.K. “I feel good,” Ms. Bethea said. “I am alive!”

All morning, thwarted travelers spilled into the streets of Times Square, towing suitcases in bewildered silence. They gathered at police cordons stretched across the city’s most trafficked thoroughfares, boulevards vacant at the height of the holiday season, and filmed the red lights of scores of emergency vehicles.

On Monday morning, police searched a six-story apartment building where Mr. Ullah may have lived with his parents on Ocean Parkway, as well as two other residences. At around 11 a.m. officers led a woman in a dark coat from the Ocean Parkway home, a gray hijab covering her hair, into a patrol car, and sped off. The area is home to a few thousand Bangladeshi-born residents, and it represents the heart of their Brooklyn community, with stores and mosques built along Church Avenue.

Mr. Ullah is a permanent United States resident, according to Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, having arrived in 2011.

The method of attack — self-detonation, or the attempt at least — introduces something of a new element to a long history of the city as target, a place that has yet somehow avoided the bomb-wearing attackers that are the hallmark of terrorism in places like Israel and Nigeria.

Since the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, there have been about 26 terrorist plots against the city that officials have identified as being thwarted “through intelligence, investigation and interdiction,” John J. Miller, the Police Department’s commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference on Monday.

But more recently, the string of foiled plots gave way to closer calls.

In 2009, law enforcement authorities prevented a cell of people with ties to operatives of Al Qaeda from carrying out plans to bomb subway trains. A year later, in May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant, tried to detonate a truck with explosives in Times Square — but his devices did not go off.

In September 2016, a crude homemade explosive crafted from a pressure cooker packed with shrapnel was left on 27th Street in Chelsea, exploding but killing no one. Before Monday, the last attack was on Halloween, when a man spurred by Islamic State propaganda drove a rental truck down a bicycle path on Manhattan’s West Side, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The man, Sayfullo Saipov, was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors; he has pleaded not guilty.

While no formal announcement had been made, both federal and local law enforcement officials indicated that Mr. Ullah would be prosecuted in federal court in Manhattan by the office of the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim.

But by Monday afternoon, the city was busy forgetting. On 42nd Street, tourists strolled unperturbed, or hurried into the reopened bus depot to catch their rides.

Just hours before, John Frank had stood on that street by the Port Authority exit when he felt tremors through the pavement. “That’s how strong it was,” said Mr. Frank, 54. Shaken, he fled a flew blocks away, and stood for a few long minutes, leaning against a garbage can for support.

“In New York City, we are vulnerable to a lot of things,” Mr. Frank said. “These incidents are happening too frequently.”

以它的规模而言，这座城市有两样东西短缺——绿地和艺术。为改进这点，上海掷下重金，在一个叫做西岸的新区打造了属于自己的“博物馆大道”(Museum Mile)和一个河滨公园。由藤本壮介担纲设计的余德耀美术馆（门票150元）坐落在一个老飞机库内，走在这里的文化觉醒的前沿。近些年举办了一些重量级展览，展出了安迪·沃霍尔(Andy Warhol)、阿尔佩托·贾科梅蒂(Alberto Giacometti)以及布鲁克林艺术家KAWS。顺着江岸走不出多远，便是一片发展迅速的艺术建筑群，满是工作室和画廊。其中有让人肃然起敬的香格纳画廊(ShanghART，免费)，会展出中国新锐艺术家的作品，也出售如周铁海和丁乙等更有名的艺术家的作品。今年秋季，备受瞩目的大田画廊(Ota Fine Arts)也加入其中。

2) 下午6:00，空中欢乐时光

很难想象，有着极其现代化天际线的浦东，在30年前只不过是一片农田。不妨一边品着鸡尾酒、欣赏着日落时分绝美的灯光秀，一边琢磨这个问题吧。日落时，熠熠发光的大楼被闪现的“我爱上海”信息照亮，江面上还有灯光闪烁的船只驶过。有很多地方可供你品一杯沐浴在霓虹之中的夕暮饮品，但是在英迪格酒店(Hotel Indigo)30层上，“恰”酒吧的露台有着最佳的视野——更别提超级好喝的开胃鸡尾酒了（售价130元）。

3) 下午7:30，牛肉竞拍

上海的明星大厨不计其数，但没人可以与法国人保罗·佩莱(Paul Pairet)的影响力相媲美。他创办了营业到深夜的Mr. & Mrs. Bund和不断打破规则、人均600美元的Ultraviolet。最新推出的“The Chop Chop Club”延续了他对奇异用餐体验的热爱。菜单以烧烤为主，食客们可以竞逐最新鲜的肉品。餐厅内，巨大电子屏上显示着出菜时间和当前点餐：“照烧碳烤焦牛尾，19:45，4份，250人民币！”先到先得。肉和鱼都经过精心制备，如果错过了你的首选，整晚都会为你提供“B’ocktails”（装在精美玻璃瓶里的预制鸡尾酒）。

4) 晚上9:00，夜总会复兴

新掘的财富使上海重现了二战前的骄佚奢淫——少了鸦片馆而已。在偏远而粗粝的虹口区，你可以在珍珠剧场里找到上海最俗艳的派对。珍珠剧场原本是一座佛寺，后来被改造成了一个歌舞夜总会，奢华的红色长椅和两层楼座围绕着暧昧的舞台。节目单上什么都有，从模糊性别的变装表演，到歌舞杂剧（高空秋千和喷火杂耍是出现得最多的，也是最令人心跳的）。还有不那么低俗的演出，比如大部分由当地演员参演的“爵士女伶”纪念音乐会。大多数演出的入场费大约在200元左右，可以去Facebook查看日程。

周六

5) 上午10:00，毛泽东的上海

从昔日的法租界气氛中开始一天的历史之行吧。在一栋公寓楼地下室里的上海宣传画艺术中心（Shanghai Propaganda Poster Art Centre，门票25元）可能要花些力气才能找到。馆内由收藏家杨培明收集的共产党宣传画十分精彩，时间跨度从20世纪40年代一直到70年代末的后毛泽东时代。馆内出售原版海报，还有英文版、法文版甚至藏语版的红宝书。接着，还可以去武康路上欣赏一幢幢风格各异的20世纪初豪宅。其中大多都不向公众开放，但旁边的宋庆龄故居（门票20元）——她作为孙中山夫人的身份可能更为人所知——樟树荫盖的小巧花园值得一看，还有那辆约瑟夫·斯大林(Joseph Stalin)在20世纪50年代赠予她的苏联产豪华轿车。

6) 下午12:30，吃一顿呼噜噜的午饭

墙上的菜单有句话说明了一切：“现点，现包，现蒸，现吃。”在麟笼坊，要的就是新鲜——这个狭小的餐厅只专注做小笼包这一件事，做得也非常好，客人点多少做多少。烹饪展示也令人大饱眼福——健谈的厨师们快速而细致地擀面、包馅，再捏出一个个小笼包。这些包子能轻而易举地打败那些高档店面的出品，尤其是美味的纯蟹粉小笼包（99元）。纸巾是必备的，因为吃起来会比较狼狈。

7) 下午3:00，艺术丝线

在众多大同小异的奢侈品商场之外，上海有太多的独立服装店可以发掘。“栋梁”是要找中国新锐女性时尚设计师的必去之处，两年前拓展了一个男装部。可以看看瞿创的泥染夹克和上海品牌“ChairEyes”变幻出来的醒目眼镜。要买带有现代设计感的传统面料，新开张的店铺“Klee Klee”有用有机蚕丝制作的女装，以及由贵州偏远地区的侗族工匠缝制的彩色枕头和被子。“Shokay”则专门制作环保的牦牛绒毯和牦牛绒毛衣，原料采购自藏人牧民。

8) 晚上7:00，不吃肉的地方

对于素食者来说，中国可能是一个充满风险的地方——就连那些看似安全的菜肴，比如扁豆和豆腐，也往往加入了肉末。但在“大蔬无界”餐厅，你就不必担心了。这个安静的餐厅布置了木桌子、柔和的灯光，以及将宾客分开的半透明纱幕。它展示充满创意的素食烹饪，菜单随季节变化，食材来自中国的偏远地区（比如，野生菌菇是从与缅甸接壤的云南省空运过来的）。青椒酱葱油核桃（98元）和日式裹面包屑炸蘑菇（88元）等菜肴也很美味。这家餐厅不供应酒，不过在品尝了起泡的蔓越莓乌龙醋茶（42元）后，你根本意识不到这一点。

9) 晚上10:00，复古旋律

从前门装饰艺术风格的字体，到天花板上悬挂的精致铜扇，私密的爵士酒吧Heyday让人想起了20世纪20、30年代上海的繁华，当时爵士乐在追求享乐的外国租界里十分流行。这里的酒水单也在向爵士乐经典致敬，比如Minnie the Moocher鸡尾酒（含有本尼迪克特甜酒、埃玛娜葡萄酒、柠檬、橘子酱和蛋清）就是以卡布·卡洛韦(Cab Calloway)的一首歌命名的。Heyday的乐队由上海爵士乐坛的常青树、俄罗斯裔以色列钢琴家奥列格·罗辛(Oleg Roschin)领衔，每晚都有演出，歌手是轮换的。卡座和包间的费用各不相同，但酒吧区的座位是免费的。在这个舒适的酒吧里，哪个座位都很好。

周日

10) 上午6:00，在外滩日出中醒来

在一天中的这个宁静的时刻，深夜的狂欢者和早起的人在历史悠久的外滩找到了共同的灵感——当太阳从浦东天际线和黄浦江上升起时（有人称之为“Bundrise”[外滩日出]），退休的老人悠闲地打着太极。它也是一处绝佳的慢跑地点——在北岸沿着外滩，穿过有百年历史的全钢结构外百渡桥，然后沿着苏州河慢跑。如果这对你来说太早了，那就在雅致的申报馆咖啡厅(The Press)喝一杯咖啡，它位于装修华丽、历史悠久的申报馆大楼内，那里曾是上海首家日报社的所在地。

11) 上午10:00，登高瞭望

高达632米的上海中心大厦是世界第二高楼，在它的映衬下，周围的摩天大楼显得小得可怜。在一个晴朗的日子里，从118层的观景台上俯瞰上海，那景象同样令人印象深刻——无穷无尽的公寓楼和写字楼向着地平线延伸，直到被平静、蜿蜒的黄浦江打断（门票180元人民币）。对于摩天大楼爱好者来说，这座高耸的圆柱形大楼内还有一间让人大开眼界的博物馆，从中可以了解到各种逸闻趣事。这座大楼不仅有世界上最重的防止摇晃的减震器（1000吨），还有世界上最快的电梯，它能以每小时65公里的速度将游客迅速带到楼顶。

住宿

备受期待的上海嘉佩乐酒店(Capella Shanghai)是总部位于新加坡的奢华酒店连锁在中国开设的第一家酒店，它于9月开业，位于修复后的石库门建筑群，那里最初是20世纪30年代为法国贸易商建造的。该酒店共有55栋别墅，位于三层楼高的传统住宅里，带有私人庭院和屋顶阳台，每晚起价4000元人民币。

另一家新开的酒店是上海外滩W酒店，它的位置很好，就在外滩往北一点，从它的室外游泳池能看到令人惊叹的浦东天际线美景。它的374间客房里配备着一套很滑稽的东西：汤包和超大筷子形状的抱枕。标准间每晚1680元。",36小时玩转上海,https://cn.nytstyle.com/travel/20171205/36hours-shanghai/

I was conditioned by my art history professors to believe that only the work of white people mattered.
The art world that once seemed glamorous and exciting now was insufferable in its casual and deeply ingrained bigotry, elitism and allegiance to wealth.
My relationship with the art world remains tenuous.","I stood in the lunchroom doorway with my friend Kevin, bewildered. It was our first week at the High School of Music and Art, a West Harlem public school, and we had become instant friends. Still, I did not know where I belonged in a room that had casually self-segregated into racial camps where “minority” teens gravitated to one side, whites to the other.

Apparently, in 1971, the choice was simple for most of our classmates. But less so for me. I knew I wanted to sit with Kevin. But while we both lived in low-income housing projects, we differed in one significant way: Kevin was black and I was white. After a white student told us we did not belong on her side, my mind was made up: We headed to the “Black Side,” as we called it, where we ate until the lunchroom gradually integrated during our freshman year.

This story comes to mind whenever I’m asked why I write about race and photography. I return to it because where I sat in that divided lunchroom says a lot about my relationship to race and my lifelong fascination with it. My sister and I were among the few white kids in our predominantly black and Puerto Rican housing project on the Lower East Side. Except for a harrowing stint at a Jewish day school, where I was tormented for being poor, my classmates and my young neighbors and friends, were all people of color. They allowed me into their lives, and I learned a lot from them.

But it was the prejudice they experienced, and I observed, that provided my most eye-opening lesson.

As a Jew, I have known anti-Semitism. As a gay man, I have known homophobia. But neither has seemed as relentless as the racism I witnessed growing up — a steady drumbeat of slights, thinly-veiled hostility and condescension perpetrated by even the most liberal and well-meaning people. It was painful to watch, and as my friends let me know, considerably more painful to endure.

Continually observing this reality shaped how I understood racism: When people told me they had experienced prejudice, I believed them. I had rejected the liberal tendency to defensively dismiss the victim to protect the accused.

My childhood also exposed me to cultures and histories that most white people were oblivious to, even if they lived in an international city. I learned about these things from my friends, classmates, teachers and my socially conscious father. As my activism and passion grew, so did my solidarity with the Lower East Side. But my enthusiasm was dampened at Music and Art, where my poverty again alienated me from some of my teachers and classmates.

Out of embarrassment, I hid my background and interest in race.

My freshman advisor at Hunter College, certain that the study of race was inconsistent with my “cultivated mind,” as she put it, persuaded me to focus on art history. My studies in college, and later in graduate school, completed my transformation from Project Boy to Cultured White Man. I was conditioned by my art history professors to believe that only the work of white people mattered. I engaged a mainstream art world — museums, galleries, collectors, and publishers — that viewed artists of color as sentimental or irrelevant at best, but more often as inept and dull. I eventually accepted these racist myths, even as I continued to live in the projects.

But I also experienced another awakening: I learned how to see.

My mentors in art history were rigorous and demanding, teaching me to visually analyze paintings and photographs, both to appreciate their aesthetics and to grasp their underlying cultural meaning. I was trained to “deconstruct” images, to evaluate the ways they advanced an agenda or manipulated or inspired viewers. But my teachers were oblivious to artists and photographers of color and work about race, a deficiency I inherited from them.

Yet my roots tugged at me as I started to miss the ardor and conviction of my youth. The art world that once seemed glamorous and exciting now was insufferable in its casual and deeply ingrained bigotry, elitism and allegiance to wealth. I picked up books by intellectuals ignored by my professors — brilliant race writers, like W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Frantz Fanon, who were deconstructing the world years before the scholars I had been assigned to read in school. I engaged new colleagues and researched new artists. And I began doing projects about race, relearning how to see and comprehend it through pictures.

In the summer of 2012, after a quarter century of publishing articles and books and curating exhibitions that reconciled the insights of my formal education with those of my life, I started writing Race Stories. I think of it as a learning experience, for me and the reader, fostering the racial and visual literacy denied me by my teachers.

My relationship with the art world remains tenuous. While some things have changed — art history has become more inclusive, for example, and a few artists of color have become superstars — the problem of racism persists. Recently, I attended a dinner in an expensive restaurant celebrating a friend’s New York museum retrospective, and the scene was typical and dispiriting: A sea of affluent white people dressed in black.

These days, I rarely go to events like this. In their segregation, they bring me back to the contentious lunchroom where, as a bewildered teenager, I pushed beyond the imposed limitations of my race. But in situations like this dinner, there is no “black side” to which I can retreat, no haven that even remotely resembles the life I lived or the one I live now.

In the slideshow above, the author selects and writes about some of his favorite photographs explored in the Race Stories series.

(Mr. Moore said late Monday that he had taken his wife to West Point to see their son.)","And so with turnout the biggest riddle, both Mr. Jones and Mr. Moore scrambled Monday to shore up support where they could. After dark, Mr. Moore rallied supporters in this rural area of southeast Alabama, a near-certain trove of Republican votes. Mr. Jones, who spent his weekend appearing with prominent black Democrats, campaigned in Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama’s two most populous cities, to try to energize urban and African-American voters who would be central to a Democratic victory.

Mr. Jones, a former United States attorney who also needs support from independent and Republican voters if he is to win on Tuesday, tried to balance his get-out-the-vote appeals to Democrats with outreach to people who ordinarily would not consider voting for a Democrat. Indeed, it seemed his most powerful weapon was a Republican: Senator Richard C. Shelby, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, who, in an interview on CNN on Sunday, denounced Mr. Moore and declared that Alabama “deserves better.”

“The people of the state, they have elected Richard Shelby for four decades,” Mr. Jones said of the senator, who has said he wrote in “a distinguished Republican” rather than vote for Mr. Moore. “They’re going to listen to Richard Shelby.”

Mr. Jones also earned an implicit boost, of a sort, from Condoleezza Rice, the Republican former secretary of state and an Alabama native. In a statement issued by her office on Monday afternoon, Ms. Rice called on Alabamians to “reject bigotry, sexism and intolerance” and “insist that our representatives are dignified, decent and respectful of the values we hold dear.”

While Ms. Rice did not mention either candidate by name, and it is unclear how widely her statement will be seen before Election Day, she joined Mr. Shelby in giving a permission slip to wavering Republicans who may be tempted to vote for someone other than a nominee they find intolerable. Some Republicans, echoing Mr. Shelby, have written-in other figures, and a liberal “super PAC,” hoping to starve Mr. Moore of Republican voters who are skeptical of both candidates, has urged write-in votes for Nick Saban, the University of Alabama’s head football coach.

That Mr. Jones is even in a position to benefit from a make-or-break turnout effort is extraordinary by the standards of Alabama, where no Democrat has won an election for Senate or governor in almost 20 years and the party’s statewide infrastructure has crumbled and all but collapsed. A Fox News poll published on Monday found Mr. Jones with a 10-point lead over Mr. Moore, but other recent surveys have found Mr. Moore ahead, and private Democratic polling shows a closer race than the Fox poll suggested.

The campaign’s basic mathematics are widely agreed upon: If Mr. Jones can attract the votes of young people and African-Americans, and peel away a chunk of Republican-leaning whites — particularly women — who recoil from Mr. Moore, then he has a chance to win. Otherwise, the state’s conservative D.N.A. is all but certain to kick in and rescue Mr. Moore from tribulations of his own making.

Mr. Moore, who has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, has been a surprisingly rare sight in public as the campaign nears its end. But he re-emerged at a chandelier-adorned, barnlike building here Monday night in his first public appearance since last Tuesday. The event in Dale County was safe political ground for Mr. Moore, who won 66 percent of the county’s vote in his last statewide general election.

At a rally that featured three conservative firebrands — Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser; David Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis.; and Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas — Mr. Moore’s supporters urged voters to show up on Tuesday.

“This comes down simply to who is going to work the hardest,” Mr. Bannon said at the rally, which, at varying points, included the theme music to “Mission Impossible” and boos at the mention of Mr. Shelby’s name.

Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, later made an emotional appeal on her husband’s behalf, mounting a sustained assault on what she called “fake news” and trying to immunize Mr. Moore from attacks that he disliked women in positions of power, black people and Jewish people.

“One of our attorneys is a Jew,” she said. “We have very close friends that are Jewish and rabbis, and we also fellowship with them.”

Along a road near the event site, protesters gathered to demonstrate against Mr. Moore. Some held signs supporting Mr. Jones, and another placard read: “Real Christians Aren’t Bigots.”

Rural and reliably Republican pockets of east Alabama, like Dale County, could prove to be Mr. Moore’s political salvation. Along a stretch of U.S. Route 431 between Phenix City and Dothan on Monday, signs promoting Mr. Moore were common. Advertisements for Mr. Jones, whose signs fill yards in places like Birmingham and Gadsden, were rare.

Mr. Jones’s strategy does not depend on carrying rural counties that hug Georgia and Florida. Instead, he is hoping to run up significant leads in Alabama’s urban and suburban areas, drawing on traditional Democratic voters as well as Republicans spooked by the allegations against Mr. Moore or a controversial record that predates the Senate campaign.

Speaking briefly at an event space attached to a vintage car showroom in Birmingham, flanked by the basketball star Charles Barkley, Mr. Jones cast the vote as a choice that would define Alabama’s identity.

“It is time that we put our decency, our state, before political party,” Mr. Jones said. Mr. Barkley was more blunt: “At some point, we’ve got to stop looking like idiots to the nation.”

Although Mr. Jones is running against the tides of recent political history in Alabama, Mr. Moore is a deeply divisive figure in the state, where he was, in effect, twice removed as chief justice of the State Supreme Court.

He has a base of supporters whose fervor is the envy of Democrats, as well as plenty of Republicans who have hoped to vanquish him over the years. But should Mr. Moore prevail on Tuesday, he will likely have Mr. Trump, in part, to thank. The president did not visit Alabama after Mr. Moore won the Republican nomination in September, but he repeatedly took to Twitter in support of Mr. Moore and recorded an automated phone message that went out to Republican voters. (For his part, Mr. Jones dispatched automated phone calls from former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.)

Mr. Trump provided Mr. Moore with a crucial seal of approval at a moment of crisis for his campaign, effectively offering reassurance to Republicans who were uneasy about Mr. Moore’s scandals that it was acceptable to vote for him. At a rally last Friday just over the border in Florida, Mr. Trump hailed Mr. Moore as critical to enacting a “‘Make America Great Again’ agenda” in the Senate.

But Mr. Moore’s campaign has been unable to move past the allegations that made the race a close one, and the candidate himself has not made much of a public effort to deliver a pointed closing message.

On Monday morning, Mr. Jones ridiculed Mr. Moore for effectively going underground at the most intense moment in the race. He mockingly alluded to reports that Mr. Moore attended the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia. (Mr. Moore said late Monday that he had taken his wife to West Point to see their son.)

“Here I am once again, surrounded by this gaggle, which I’ve come to love and enjoy, while Roy Moore was not even in the state of Alabama over this weekend,” Mr. Jones said, adding, “When is the last time you’ve heard of a candidate for statewide office leave the state?”","Alabama Senate Race, Unlikely Nail-Biter, Races to Finish Line",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/alabama-roy-moore-doug-jones.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“Today we pledge he will not be the last,” Mr. Trump said.

The directive, which came on the 45th anniversary of Apollo 17’s landing on the moon, calls for collaboration with commercial companies and other nations, but it did not specify when the moon mission would occur or how much it might cost.

Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself for the second time in two months calming the city after a terrorist attack, in this case, on the system that moves millions of people across the city every day.

“Our lives revolve around the subway,” he said at a news conference on Eighth Avenue a few hours after the incident. “The choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world. And we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.”

“The terrorists want to undermine that,” the mayor added. “They yearn to attack New York City.”

Investigators, led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, believe Mr. Ullah acted alone, but they only have just begun to review materials from the searches and other leads.

Christina Bethea was in the underground walkway, headed to her job as a security guard, when the explosion nearly knocked her over, sending a haze of smoke into the corridor packed with commuters. She did not see where it came from, she said. “As soon as we heard ‘boom!’ we began to run,” she said. An hour after the attack, she stood outside the bus terminal, calling her mother and father in North Carolina to tell them she was O.K. “I feel good,” Ms. Bethea said. “I am alive!”

All morning, thwarted travelers spilled into the streets of Times Square, towing suitcases in bewildered silence. They gathered at police cordons stretched across the city’s most trafficked thoroughfares, boulevards vacant at the height of the holiday season, and filmed the red lights of scores of emergency vehicles.

On Monday morning, police searched a six-story apartment building where Mr. Ullah may have lived with his parents on Ocean Parkway, as well as two other residences. At around 11 a.m. officers led a woman in a dark coat from the Ocean Parkway home, a gray hijab covering her hair, into a patrol car, and sped off. The area is home to a few thousand Bangladeshi-born residents, and it represents the heart of their Brooklyn community, with stores and mosques built along Church Avenue.

Mr. Ullah is a permanent United States resident, according to Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, having arrived in 2011.

The method of attack — self-detonation, or the attempt at least — introduces something of a new element to a long history of the city as target, a place that has yet somehow avoided the bomb-wearing attackers that are the hallmark of terrorism in places like Israel and Nigeria.

Since the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, there have been about 26 terrorist plots against the city that officials have identified as being thwarted “through intelligence, investigation and interdiction,” John J. Miller, the Police Department’s commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference on Monday.

But more recently, the string of foiled plots gave way to closer calls.

In 2009, law enforcement authorities prevented a cell of people with ties to operatives of Al Qaeda from carrying out plans to bomb subway trains. A year later, in May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant, tried to detonate a truck with explosives in Times Square — but his devices did not go off.

In September 2016, a crude homemade explosive crafted from a pressure cooker packed with shrapnel was left on 27th Street in Chelsea, exploding but killing no one. Before Monday, the last attack was on Halloween, when a man spurred by Islamic State propaganda drove a rental truck down a bicycle path on Manhattan’s West Side, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The man, Sayfullo Saipov, was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors; he has pleaded not guilty.

While no formal announcement had been made, both federal and local law enforcement officials indicated that Mr. Ullah would be prosecuted in federal court in Manhattan by the office of the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim.

But by Monday afternoon, the city was busy forgetting. On 42nd Street, tourists strolled unperturbed, or hurried into the reopened bus depot to catch their rides.

Just hours before, John Frank had stood on that street by the Port Authority exit when he felt tremors through the pavement. “That’s how strong it was,” said Mr. Frank, 54. Shaken, he fled a flew blocks away, and stood for a few long minutes, leaning against a garbage can for support.

“In New York City, we are vulnerable to a lot of things,” Mr. Frank said. “These incidents are happening too frequently.”

In 1980, 7 percent of Mexicans were obese, a figure that tripled to 20.3 percent by 2016, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Diabetes is now Mexico’s top killer, claiming 80,000 lives a year, the World Health Organization has reported.

For many Mexicans, Nafta promised to make real “the fever dreams of joining the modern economy,” said Timothy A. Wise, a trade expert at the Small Planet Institute and Tufts University. “All former rural workers would be in new jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing industries of the post-Nafta world. That just hasn’t happened.”

“The only way that Mexico became a ‘first world’ country was in terms of diet.”

The phenomenon is not limited to Mexico. Research shows free trade is among the key factors that have accelerated the spread of low-nutrient, highly processed foods from the west, “driving the obesity epidemic in China, India, and other developing countries worldwide,” according to the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.

But Jaime Zabludovsky Kuper, Mexico’s deputy chief negotiator on the pact, said Nafta didn’t cause obesity. Instead, he said, it lowered food prices and reduced malnutrition. In 2012, 1.6 percent of Mexican children suffered from severe malnutrition, a sharp drop from 6.2 percent in 1988, according to government data.

Mr. Zabludovsky said that Mexicans had long been enticed by American food, and that high tariffs used to make it expensive, not unavailable. The economy is now more stable, he said, and Mexicans are living longer — which is partly why more people are dying from noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease. “It’s a symptom of relative prosperity,” he said.

The broader pros and cons of Nafta have come under increasing scrutiny given President Trump’s threats to dismantle it. Among its chief champions are American farm and food-retailing interests whose fortunes have benefited tremendously from the open market. Mexican exports to the United States have surged, and a more stable economic structure has evolved in Mexico. The country’s unemployment rate has stayed mostly constant, but average wages have fallen to $15,311 in 2016 from $16,008 in 1994, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico’s largely isolated economy.

In addition to dramatically lowering cross-border tariffs, Nafta let billions of dollars in direct foreign investment into Mexico, fueled the growth of American fast food restaurants and convenience stores, and opened the floodgates to cheap corn, meat, high-fructose corn syrup and processed foods.","A Nasty, Nafta-Related Surprise: Mexico’s Soaring Obesity",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/health/obesity-mexico-nafta.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

One study estimated that 47 percent of human behaviors are of this habitual variety.

Yet many people persist in buying branded products even when equivalent generics are available. These choices are noteworthy for drugs, when generics and branded options are chemically equivalent. Why continue to buy a name-brand aspirin when the same chemical compound sits nearby at a cheaper price? Scientists have already verified that the two forms of aspirin are identical. A little personal experimentation would presumably reassure you that the generic has the same effect.

Our common failure to experiment extends well past generics, as one recent study illustrates. On Feb. 5, 2014, London Underground workers went on a 48-hour strike, forcing the closings of several tube stops. The affected commuters had to find alternate routes.

When the strike ended, most people reverted to their old patterns. But roughly one in 20 stuck with the new route, shaving 6.7 minutes from what had been an average 32-minute commute.

The closings imposed by the strike forced experimentation with alternate routes, yielding valuable results. And if the strike had been longer, even more improvements would probably have been discovered.

Yet the fact that many people needed a strike to force them to experiment reveals the deep roots of a common reluctance to experiment. For example, when I think of my favorite restaurants, the ones I have visited many times, it is striking how few of the menu items I have tried. And when I think of all the lunch places near my workplace, I realize that I keep going to the same places again and again.

Habits are powerful. We persist with many of them because we tend to give undue emphasis to the present. Trying something new can be painful: I might not like what I get and must forgo something I already enjoy. That cost is immediate, while any benefits — even if they are large — will be enjoyed in a future that feels abstract and distant. Yes, I want to know what else my favorite restaurant does well, but today I just want my favorite dish.

Overconfidence also holds us back. I am unduly certain in my guesses of what the alternatives will be like, even though I haven’t tried them.

Finally, many so-called choices are not really choices at all. Walking down the supermarket aisle, I do not make a considered decision about soda. I don’t even pause at the generics. I act without thinking; I automatically grab bottles of Diet Coke as I wheel my cart by.

This is true not only in our personal lives. Executives and policymakers fail to experiment in their jobs, and these failures can be particularly costly. For example, in hiring, executives often apply their preconceived notions of which applicants will be a “good fit” as prospective employees. Yet those presumptions are nothing more than guesses and are rarely given the scrutiny of experimentation.

Hiring someone who doesn’t appear to be a good fit is surely risky, yet it might also prove the presumptions wrong, an outcome that is especially valuable when these presumptions amount to built-in advantages for men or whites or people from economically or culturally advantaged backgrounds.

For government policymakers, experimentation is a thorny issue. We are right to be wary of “experimenting” in the sense of playing with people’s lives. Yet we should also be wary of an automatic bias in favor of the status quo. That can amount to a Panglossian belief that the current policy is best, whereas the current policy may actually be a wobbly structure held together by overconfidence, historical accident and the power of precedent.

Experimentation is an act of humility, an acknowledgment that there is simply no way of knowing without trying something different.

Understanding that truth is a first step, but it is important to act on it.

The independent arbiter would then make a nonbinding proposal addressing what happened and what should be done. It could include a call to resign or for censure, or a range of other responses tailored to the findings.

This isn’t just about Senator Franken. Other lawmakers have also been accused of harassment. We need a system to deal with that messy reality, and the current one of investigating those complaints is opaque, takes too long and has not worked to protect vulnerable women and men from harassment. And the current alternative — off with the head of the accused, regardless of the accusation — is too quick, too easily subject to political manipulation and too vulnerable to the passions of the moment.

We don’t have the system I’m suggesting. But that doesn’t mean we should give up on process. On Nov. 30, a Senate ethics panel announced the beginning of an investigation into the allegations against Senator Franken. It should run its course, and we should see the results. Then we’ll know whether his planned resignation was warranted.

With time, and the existing ethics procedures, things are likely to emerge that will surprise us all. New facts may put Senator Franken in a better light, or a far worse one, and we should be open to both.

Elections are different. Voters have a responsibility to make a judgment with whatever facts are available on Election Day. In the case of Roy Moore, voters in Alabama ought take the very serious accusations into account. But if Mr. Moore is elected to the Senate, he should immediately be subject to the same kind of ethics inquiry that I am recommending for Senator Franken.

Finally, the nature of the behaviors matter, too. Proportionality means that after investigating, Congress should fully consider the best response to the revealed conduct.

My first job out of law school was representing people on death row in North Carolina, where I often saw the impact of hasty prosecutions. I represented a man on death row whose lawyers had spent all of eight hours looking into his claim of innocence. I met men whose lawyers had never looked into their backgrounds. I also lived in the legal environment that produced the Duke University lacrosse case, in which three students were falsely accused of rape by the prosecutor in the case, who was later disbarred for his conduct. The quick rush to public condemnation of the players, fueled by the media, ended up hurting the accuser and the accused.

Package management “has become a big issue in buildings,” said Dan Wurtzel, the president of FirstService Residential New York.

Does your landlord have to reimburse you for the value of the lost items? Probably not. “The landlord is unlikely to be held responsible for the missing packages,” said Noah E. Levenson, a landlord-tenant lawyer with the firm Levy Tolman in Manhattan.

But your landlord does have a responsibility to secure the property. Use the petition to put the landlord on notice about security breaches and the safety hazard the thefts expose. A tenant who encounters someone stealing packages could be harmed — and the letter should point out this risk. “Landlords are liable for criminal acts by third parties if they’re on notice and not properly securing the building,” Mr. Levenson said.

You and your neighbors could also call 311 about the faulty locks. If you see a suspicious person loitering in the lobby, call the police. If you get no response, you could file what is known as an HP proceeding in housing court where a judge could compel the landlord to fix the problem, but you may not need to take that step. Landlords “don’t want these people in there, either,” Mr. Levenson said.

After making the repairs, management should remind tenants that they have to be vigilant, too. “Residents have to be reminded during the holiday season to be very careful about who they let into the building,” Mr. Wurtzel said.

After all, in the early 1980s, the political upheaval and violence in nearby El Salvador — where I was based — dominated the headlines. We should have kept covering the civil war there, the spokesman said, since there really wasn’t anything worth covering in Guatemala.

But that only hardened our resolve to take a closer look. We redoubled our efforts to report on the military and opposition groups ensnared in what would ultimately be a 36-year conflict that claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people, mostly indigenous Maya, between 1960 and 1996. Some 45,000 victims disappeared, while more than one million people were displaced. Yet this conflict raged on in relative obscurity and mystery, even as the 1980s ushered in an era of horrific violence.

Traveling by bus from Guatemala City and into the Quiché highlands to the northwest, the urban bustle gave way to a dramatic landscape of rolling, verdant hills, though the awe inspired by that vista was soon displaced by a sense of menace. Army checkpoints appeared 30 minutes outside of Chichicastenango, where bus and car passengers lined up to show identity papers. Foreign tourists were generally exempt from the low-level suspicion and harassment shown to the Maya.

I was familiar with Guatemala’s turbulent political history and the C.I.A.’s support of its 1954 coup. But I was relatively new to the daily terror tactics of Central America where U.S.-backed troops used fear and violence to contain a growing left-wing insurgency. But unlike in El Salvador, where the United States openly provided military advisers and equipment, American support for Guatemala’s military government was purposefully hidden and downplayed.

The military’s campaign of violence and terror was carried out with rigor and exactitude. The way to multiply a political murder’s horror was to leave corpses in full public view, like on the side of the road with a slit throat and torn-off clothing. “This could happen to you,” was the clear message sent to potential victims, warning them of the fate that awaited those suspected of supporting the rebels.

These weren’t peripheral incidents with marginal players but a closely-managed pacification campaign whose violent counterinsurgency tactics were supported by other right-wing anti-Communist countries and their military attachés and trainers in Guatemala. Taiwan provided anti-Communist psy-ops training; Argentina contributed counterintelligence and interrogation techniques from its own Dirty War; South Africa supplied communications equipment and training; while Israel provided weapons for the soldiers and infantry. A small number of Spanish-speaking U.S. Special Forces troops worked in the field and at military training camps.

In January 1982, I traveled with Christopher Dickey, The Washington Post’s correspondent, to the military headquarters in Santa Cruz del Quiché to speak with the Guatemalan Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Benedicto Lucas García. The French-trained general implemented a scorched-earth policy aimed at eliminating a growing insurgency in the indigenous areas of the western highlands. The rebellion was at its peak, and the Guatemalan guerrillas considered themselves allies of Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the leftist F.M.L.N in El Salvador.

The general invited Chris and me on a helicopter flight over the mountainous farming area of the Quiché, where they targeted the enemy with simple, deadly logic: Anyone running from our white Bell helicopter was either a guerrilla or a sympathizer.

Accompanied by two door-gunners and an intelligence officer, Gen. Lucas García sat in the co-pilot’s seat and directed the flight around the rural areas. We were 15 minutes from the provincial capital, flying about 1,500 feet, when he spotted a group of women running away from the approaching helicopter. He ordered the pilot to circle the farm below and bank the helicopter hard so the door gunners could have a better view.

Then he yelled out the command to open fire, “Dale! Dale!” — “Give it to them! Give it to them!”

The gunners blasted away in a hail of smoke and spent cartridges, the pilot turned and banked again, noisily circling above as civilians were cut down with the American-supplied M60 machine guns. Gen. Lucas García explained to us that since the campesinos (peasant farmers) had run away from the helicopter, they had to have been guilty. When The Washington Post published Chris’s story, Gen. Lucas García denied he ever ordered his men to fire, even though a photograph of the door-gunner in action (Slide 3) accompanied the story.

On various occasions in the early 1980s, I left El Salvador to work in Guatemala, photographing in the Ixil triangle and western highlands. I used a Rollei 2¼ camera, a tripod and black-and-white film. The film, from Todos Santos and Nebaj, had been in storage and mostly unseen since 1985.

At the time, the violence in the highlands was fearful, mysterious and intimidating. Asking villagers in Todos Santos and Nebaj to sit for a portrait, I felt the best I could hope for was a glimpse of their dignity and independence and what they were desperately trying to hold onto in the midst of the cruel, scorched-earth injustices and devastating military sweeps: Exactly what the blasé embassy spokesman had dismissively wanted us to overlook.

With the war in Afghanistan now in its 17th year, President Trump’s strategy aims to drive the Taliban to a negotiated settlement. It seeks not only to squeeze the group’s opium revenues, but also to increase Afghan army offensives backed by American air power and to hold elections to enhance the Afghan government’s legitimacy.

“The Taliban have three choices: reconcile, face irrelevance or die,” General Nicholson said.

Afghanistan specialists say they have heard such boasts before, and the war is still being fought. They also voiced doubts about the hit-them-in-the-pocketbook plan.

“It’s useful to impact the Taliban financially, but it may just drive production into neighboring Pakistan or Iran,” said David W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general who led the war effort in Afghanistan for almost two years.

Other critics said the sharp increase in airstrikes will backfire, inevitably causing more civilian casualties and the accompanying political blowback, despite the military’s best efforts to mitigate that risk.

“If you increase the number of strikes without allocating the time, personnel and resources to preventing, investigating and acknowledging each one, you get more civilian casualties,” said Daniel R. Mahanty, United States program director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an advocacy group. “It’s basic math.”

Targeting specialists at the military’s air command center in Qatar say they assembled the list of drug facilities that directly finance Taliban insurgents battling the government by examining hundreds of hours of aerial surveillance and poring over intelligence reports. Airstrikes have been carried out at night when fewer people are near the targets.

“It was a very deliberate process,” said Capt. Ryan Pretty, an Army artillery officer who is deputy chief of the team overseeing the bombing campaign’s effects.

Watching and eavesdropping on the scurrying around by drug lab operators whose depots were not hit in the first wave offered important insights for planners drawing up the next set of strikes, helping them map out local Taliban networks.

“These strikes and the aftermath taught us a lot about the complexity of the Taliban’s narcotics operations,” said Navy Lt. William Conway, a former prosecutor in Chicago who is now a lead intelligence officer for Afghanistan at the command center in Qatar.

Central to both the antidrug and troop-protection operations are the B-52’s. They are the latest chapter in the storied bomber’s history over the past six decades, from its carpet-bombing missions in the Vietnam and 1991 Persian Gulf wars, to its strategic role as part of the country’s nuclear deterrent. In January, B-52’s will deploy from Louisiana to Guam for duty in the Pacific, including near North Korea.

Of the roughly 750 B-52’s originally built, the Air Force is still flying about 75 of the sweptwing, eight-engine H-model planes. The aircraft I flew on, nicknamed Night Train, was built in 1961, making it nearly twice as old as any of its five crew members from the 69th Bomb Squadron out of Minot Air Base, N.D.

Our mission began before 5 a.m. at the squadron headquarters at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where the crew received a series of intelligence, safety and mission briefings. Following bomber tradition, the crew then sprayed on cologne (a very pungent “Extreme Liberty” for this mission).

In the pre-dawn darkness, a bus ferried the crew to its jet, its engines running, bombs hanging off its massive wings. Crew members clambered up a metal ladder into the fuselage. The two weapons officers — Soar, 30, from Pittsburgh, and Will, 28, from Arcadia, Calif. — sat in front of glowing screens in the cramped, windowless offensive operations compartment.

Up another metal ladder was the cockpit and a separate cramped, windowless space for the electronic warfare officer — Poppa, 28, from San Diego. The mission commander, Rage, 29, from Minden, Neb., and his co-pilot, Bravo, 26, from Hillsborough, N.J., ducked down an aisle and shoehorned themselves into their seats in the cockpit, while strapped into oxygen masks, flight suits, flight vests and ejection seats with parachutes. I sat in an instructor pilot seat behind Rage.

The crew members asked to be identified only by their call signs or first names for security reasons. It is a young crew, with only one member, Soar, having previously deployed overseas. One of a dozen crews in the squadron, this was their 23rd mission to Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria since arriving in September.

At 5:41 a.m., with the reddish dawn seeping across the horizon, the B-52 lumbered down the runway and roared off on the 3 and a half-hour flight to southern Nangahar Province in eastern Afghanistan, where Taliban and Islamic State fighters are battling with Afghan army troops for control.

Once there, with jaw-dropping views of 16,000-foot, snow-capped peaks out the tiny cockpit windows, the crew received instructions from Special Operations forces working with Afghan troops on the ground to use their high-powered camera sensors to spy on several buildings in a village compound, and look for any “nefarious” activity.

In this case, the B-52 was acting as an airborne cavalry, ready to rush to the aid of friendly forces with a formidable arsenal that included about two dozen 2,000-pound and 500-pound laser-guided bombs — more than 10 tons of destruction in all.

Inside the B-52, affectionately known as a Buff (as in “Big, Ugly, Fat,” followed by an expletive), the noise was deafening. Crew members wore headphones and talked over microphones. Thirteen hours is a long time in a very confined space, and the crew has tricks to stay alert, including energy drinks and lots of caffeine. An eclectic mix of heavy metal, rock, country and rap music blared through their headphones.

For six hours, the B-52 flew tightly banked routes to give Soar the best view of his potential targets. Black-and-white images flickered across his screen: A man chopping wood. A woman doing laundry. Suddenly, he spotted something suspicious: a man pulling a long cylindrical object out from under a tarp. Was it just a long piece of wood or pipe, or was it a surface-to-air missile?

Taking no chances, Rage and Bravo veered the plane out of missile range, and called for an armed Reaper drone nearby to take a closer look. After nearly an hour and some delays, the B-52 needed to turn back to base without resolving the minor mystery.

No bombs were dropped that day, as has been the case on about a quarter of the crew’s so-called overwatch missions to protect Afghan troops. “But the good guys got home safely,” said Rage.","Hunting Taliban and Islamic State Fighters, From 20,000 Feet",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/asia/taliban-isis-afghanistan-drugs-b52s.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Back Story

Long before there were meatless Mondays, there were meatless Tuesdays, wheatless Wednesdays and porkless Saturdays.

One hundred years ago, during World War I, the U.S. government made an appeal for the country to sacrifice more to help its allies in Europe avoid starvation.

Americans were already encouraged to give up meat (red meat, preserved meat and lard) on Tuesdays and wheat on Wednesdays. The new instructions also excluded pork on Saturday and recommended one meal without meat or wheat each day.

“In this emergency, only the simplest of living is patriotic,” said Herbert Hoover, food administrator and a future president.

In that crucial winter, he said, “lies the period when there will be tested in this great free country of ours the question as to whether or not our people are capable of voluntary individual self-sacrifice to save the world.”

The guidelines were later tightened again, and declared a success.

Another plea to help those struggling in Europe came after World War II. President Harry Truman, in the first televised address from the White House, asked Americans to give up meat on Tuesdays and poultry and eggs on Thursdays.

“We must not fail them,” he said.

While news organizations targeted by Mr. Trump have corrected factual errors and in one recent case suspended a reporter, Mr. Trump has never backed down, for instance, from unsubstantiated claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower or that millions of illegal immigrants cast votes last year, swinging the popular tally against him.

Just last month, Mr. Trump shared with nearly 44 million Twitter followers anti-Muslim videos without verifying them; one purported to show a Dutch boy being beaten by a “Muslim migrant” who in fact was not a Muslim migrant. Mr. Trump issued no correction, and Ms. Sanders at the time said it did not matter if the video were real because “the threat is real.”

Mr. Trump has had a long history of interacting with the news media from his days as a New York developer, but it was largely transactional as he sought favorable coverage. During his business days, he planted items in gossip columns and even called reporters and used a false name, pretending to be his spokesman.

By his own account, he has always craved media attention, but his encounters with the Washington press corps have turned increasingly bitter. At one point, Mr. Trump labeled some outlets “the enemy of the American people,” and at another, he said, “It’s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.”

For the most part, Mr. Trump’s blasts at the news media have been rhetorical. But he has warned that he might go beyond name calling, such as when he threatened to try to revoke a broadcasting license for NBC after a news report he challenged. Networks like NBC do not hold federal licenses themselves, but their individual television stations do.

Mr. Trump’s administration has taken aim at CNN’s corporate ownership. The Justice Department has gone to court to block AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner, which owns Turner Broadcasting, CNN’s corporate parent. AT&T officials have said the department insisted that AT&T divest either Turner Broadcasting or its valuable DirecTV service in return for approval, which government officials denied.

Analysts said Mr. Trump’s criticisms represented an effort to undermine faith in journalism. “It is a common thing in the authoritarian playbook to discredit the media so that they are the only source that can be trusted,” said Indira Lakshmanan, who holds the Newmark chair in journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute. “Making it so there is no objective truth is the most dangerous thing of all of this.”

The raft of recent reporting errors made that easier. During a rally on Friday in Florida, Mr. Trump berated news outlets. “Did you see all the corrections the media has been making?” he asked. “They’ve been apologizing left and right.”

He ramped up attacks over the weekend on Twitter, calling for the firing of “lonely Brian Ross at ABC News” for misreporting that Mr. Trump as a candidate directed his adviser Michael T. Flynn to contact Russians. (He did so after the election as president-elect.) He denounced CNN for erroneously reporting that his campaign received a heads-up email from WikiLeaks before it released hacked Democratic Party documents. (The email came after the release.)

Mr. Trump later targeted Dave Weigel, a reporter for The Post, who tweeted a misleading photograph about the crowd size at Mr. Trump’s Florida rally. “Demand apology & retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo!” Mr. Trump wrote. Mr. Weigel did just that, deleting the picture and expressing regret, saying he did not realize it was taken before the rally started. Unsatisfied, Mr. Trump said Mr. Weigel should be fired.

Mr. Trump’s supporters said that he has a point — that such mistakes stem from a predisposition by reporters to believe the worst about him. Rather than complain when Mr. Trump points out flawed stories, they said, the news media should be more searching about its responsibility to provide balanced coverage of the president.

“Naturally, the elite media responded — not by admonishing Weigel over his inexcusably inaccurate trolling — but with their favorite claim that Trump is the one man in America who does not have the First Amendment right to criticize the media,” wrote John Nolte of Breitbart News, the site run by Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon.

Mr. Trump turned his attention on Monday to The New York Times, disputing an article describing his television habits. “Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day,” he wrote. “Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the ‘dumbest man on television!’ Bad Reporting.”

Mr. Trump posted the message about a half-hour after a segment on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” focusing on a line near the bottom of the article reporting that Mr. Trump sometimes watched Mr. Lemon on CNN to get worked up.

“We stand by our reporting, sourced from interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress, including many who interact with President Trump every day,” said Danielle Rhodes Ha, a spokeswoman for The Times.

CNN issued a statement likening Mr. Trump to a bully. “In a world where bullies torment kids on social media to devastating effect on a regular basis with insults and name calling, it is sad to see our president engaging in the very same behavior himself,” the statement said. “Leaders should lead by example.”

The effect of the news media criticism remains debated. A Politico/Morning Consult poll found that 46 percent of Americans believe the news media makes up stories about the president. A separate study by the Poynter Institute, on the other hand, found that overall trust and confidence in the news media, while low, has actually increased somewhat under Mr. Trump. The partisan divide, however, has become pronounced. Among Democrats, nearly 75 percent expressed confidence in the news media compared with only 19 percent of Republicans.

While previous presidents criticized the news media, analysts said that Mr. Trump’s attacks strike at the fundamental notion of truth in a way that can make the customary response of news organizations standing by their articles feel insufficient. It is not just the facts he is calling into question, but the very institution of journalism, which some believe demands a more vigorous reply from the mainstream media.

“When he attacks one of us, he’s actually attacking all of us,” said Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times. “We’re now confronting a guy who attacks us in ways that we’ve not seen before,” he added. “And I think maybe we should be thinking about ways to push back not just on behalf of our particular institutions but to push back on behalf of journalism itself.”

But a common response seems unlikely. “Journalistic organizations are by nature competitive, and it’s sort of hard for them to unite that way,” said David Lauter, the Washington bureau chief for The Los Angeles Times. “And I think there’s also always concern about making it seem like you’re creating an institutional fight rather than just reporting the news.”

Cameron Barr, a managing editor at The Post, said competition is “in the DNA” of news organizations. “I’m a little wary of suggestions that somehow journalistic institutions should be banding together against the chief executive,” he said. “I think that quickly ends up in an uncomfortable place, to say the least.”","Trump Escalates His Criticism of the News Media, Fueling National Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/trump-news-media-new-york-times.html

It was the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, not Boston School of Fine Arts.","When Nan Goldin looks at the photographs that defined her career, she recites a little prayer to herself: “Send love to each person that’s dead.”

For 30 years, her subjects have been those closest to her: Transsexuals, cross-dressers, drug users, lovers, all people she befriended when she moved to New York after her sister’s suicide, a succession of foster homes and struggles with parents she rejected as conformists. They lived in what mainstream critics would coldly call the “margins of society,” and many died during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.

“They were family, a community,” she said. “And now most people are dead.”

All of these subjects and more are featured in “The Beautiful Smile,” a retrospective reissued by Steidl a decade after publication with Ms. Goldin’s Hasselblad award.

Born in the Washington, D.C. area, the youngest of four in a family she described as “intellectual and revisionist,” Ms. Goldin dreamed of New York City from childhood. After being expelled from several schools, leaving home and living with various foster families, she focused on her love of fashion photography and studied at the New England School of Photography and, later, at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There she met the drag queens who became her earliest subjects.

“I never realized until someone said it to me, that they were men dressed as women,” she said. “It never crossed my mind.”

Photo

It was her goal, at the time, to put the queens — who thrived in a nighttime underground community — on the cover of Vogue. Ms. Goldin’s hybrid of art photography and the snapshot aesthetic, autobiographical detail and documentary storytelling, was innovative at a time when most photographers had to choose between one or the other. Influenced most by Larry Clark’s “Tulsa,” an autobiographical body of work about troubled youth in his hometown, Ms. Goldin always found a way to put herself in the frame, sometimes physically.

In “Nan and Brian in bed,” or “the cover of everything,” as she calls it, Ms. Goldin is curled in a ball, clinging to her pillow, watching her then-boyfriend, Brian, smoke a cigarette, his bare back glowing in the heat and brilliance of the day’s last light.

“He broke my face,” said Ms. Goldin. “I still suffer from it.”

That was documented, too, in a self-portrait titled, “Nan one month after being battered.” (Slide 5) In it, she has impeccably tweezed eyebrows, nice jewelry and crimson lipstick – and two bruised eyes that stare blankly at the camera.

“I published the picture,” she explained, “so I would never go back to him.”

Other images show lovers, many of whom were in the slideshow that made her career, “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.” With couples, she explored the struggle between intimacy and autonomy, and the inevitable dependency that she feels comes with romantic relationships.

“Any lover relationship has that, particularly between men and women,” she said. “It’s a real struggle. I don’t feel it with my friends so much, and my friends are who I live with. They’re my emotional life.”

The publication of her retrospective book marks the end of one chapter in her life and the beginning of another: Ms. Goldin has moved on from photography. Instead, she has taken up painting.

“My work used to affect people who felt lost, showed them they weren’t alone,” she said. “Helped young ones. A gay boy from Turkey told me last month that I saved his life. This is what my work was meant to do.”

Not anymore. Now she feels her photos no longer help anyone. “Nor do my paintings, but they’re for me,” she said. “An unfamiliar landscape with an unknown language.” This is something of an emotional balm when she looks at her photographs taken over the decades.

“I lost most of my friends,” she said. “There’s a generation missing in the history of the 20th century.”

The NEW Health Care Birth Control and Breast Cancer: Putting the Risk in Perspective The risk can’t be ignored but isn’t as great as it may seem from a recent study.

I have a severe intestinal condition known as ulcerative colitis. For some time, I’ve taken an immunosuppressant to control the flare-ups. Like all drugs, this one comes with side effects. While I’m on it, I have an increased risk of developing myelosuppression, a condition in which my bone marrow might stop producing blood cells and platelets. I also have an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

I know all of this, and I take the drug every day. Why? Because the benefits still outweigh the harms. I’ve been in remission from the colitis for years, which lowers my risk for colon cancer. And I don’t worry that I’m going to lose control of my bowels at any moment the way I used to.

Yes, the risks of my medication involve serious diseases like cancer. But you can’t look only at one side of the equation. You can’t look at individual harms alone and make good health decisions.

I bring all of this up because this past week there were big headlines about a new study that linked contraceptive pills and other hormonal birth control to an increased risk of breast cancer. Some news articles stressed the risk of a commonly used medication. Others, like the one by Roni Caryn Rabin in The New York Times, carefully placed the numbers in context to explain that the absolute risk is very small. (Relative risk is the percentage change in one’s absolute risk as a result of some change in behavior.)

Image The small increased breast cancer risk from birth control pills and intrauterine devices should be weighed against potential benefits. Credit Theo Stroomer for The New York Times.

I would go even further. This was a prospective cohort study, meaning it was an observational study that followed women over time and saw what happened to them naturally. The data set didn’t allow for adjusting for some factors that could also be associated with breast cancer, like age at first menstruation; whether women breast-fed; whether they consumed alcohol and how much; whether they were physically active; and more. The study found only an association, and not causal proof you might obtain from a randomized controlled trial.

Even if we accept the findings in full, we might expect an additional 13 cases of breast cancer for every 100,000 person years of use. Another way to say that is for every 7,690 women who use hormonal contraception for one year, one extra might get breast cancer. The rest would not be affected.

That’s a very small risk. Moreover, it’s for women over all. The risk is different for women of different ages. For women younger than 35, there were only two additional cases for every 100,000 person years of use. That means only one extra case of breast cancer for every 50,000 women 35 or younger who use hormonal contraception each year.

This cancer risk isn’t even a new side effect. We’ve known about the link for years. It was hoped that newer formulations might have reduced it, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. The study further established that this increased risk also holds for the hormone progestin, which is also used in pills and intrauterine devices.

Additionally, women have to make sure not to view the breast cancer risk in a vacuum. As I’ve written before, other cancers also matter. Besides breast cancer, there’s evidence that hormonal birth control is associated with higher risks of liver cancer. But it’s also associated with lower risks of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer.

If we look at all cancers together, the benefits seem to outweigh the harms. In other words, a woman who uses hormonal birth control might be less likely to develop cancer, in general, than a woman who doesn’t.

It’s important to note that these statistics assume an average risk of any one cancer or another. Should women have family histories or genetics putting them at higher or lower risks for a particular cancer, the calculus might change.

And let’s not forget that there are many noncancer-related benefits to birth control use. They can be helpful for women who have painful or very heavy periods. They can also be invaluable in family planning. Long-acting reversible contraception, praised for its convenience because it works for an extended time frame without needing any action, can save thousands of dollars over five years compared with other methods.

Every woman should discuss both the positives and the negatives of birth control with her health care provider. The risks include not only those discussed here, but also blood clots and stroke in women who smoke. They also include potential mood changes.

But there are also significant benefits, and for many women these will be greater than the harms. Any discussion that focuses only on one side, or just one aspect of one side, does women a disservice.

My freshman advisor at Hunter College, certain that the study of race was inconsistent with my “cultivated mind,” as she put it, persuaded me to focus on art history.
I was conditioned by my art history professors to believe that only the work of white people mattered.
The art world that once seemed glamorous and exciting now was insufferable in its casual and deeply ingrained bigotry, elitism and allegiance to wealth.
My relationship with the art world remains tenuous.","I stood in the lunchroom doorway with my friend Kevin, bewildered. It was our first week at the High School of Music and Art, a West Harlem public school, and we had become instant friends. Still, I did not know where I belonged in a room that had casually self-segregated into racial camps where “minority” teens gravitated to one side, whites to the other.

Apparently, in 1971, the choice was simple for most of our classmates. But less so for me. I knew I wanted to sit with Kevin. But while we both lived in low-income housing projects, we differed in one significant way: Kevin was black and I was white. After a white student told us we did not belong on her side, my mind was made up: We headed to the “Black Side,” as we called it, where we ate until the lunchroom gradually integrated during our freshman year.

This story comes to mind whenever I’m asked why I write about race and photography. I return to it because where I sat in that divided lunchroom says a lot about my relationship to race and my lifelong fascination with it. My sister and I were among the few white kids in our predominantly black and Puerto Rican housing project on the Lower East Side. Except for a harrowing stint at a Jewish day school, where I was tormented for being poor, my classmates and my young neighbors and friends, were all people of color. They allowed me into their lives, and I learned a lot from them.

But it was the prejudice they experienced, and I observed, that provided my most eye-opening lesson.

As a Jew, I have known anti-Semitism. As a gay man, I have known homophobia. But neither has seemed as relentless as the racism I witnessed growing up — a steady drumbeat of slights, thinly-veiled hostility and condescension perpetrated by even the most liberal and well-meaning people. It was painful to watch, and as my friends let me know, considerably more painful to endure.

Continually observing this reality shaped how I understood racism: When people told me they had experienced prejudice, I believed them. I had rejected the liberal tendency to defensively dismiss the victim to protect the accused.

My childhood also exposed me to cultures and histories that most white people were oblivious to, even if they lived in an international city. I learned about these things from my friends, classmates, teachers and my socially conscious father. As my activism and passion grew, so did my solidarity with the Lower East Side. But my enthusiasm was dampened at Music and Art, where my poverty again alienated me from some of my teachers and classmates.

Out of embarrassment, I hid my background and interest in race.

My freshman advisor at Hunter College, certain that the study of race was inconsistent with my “cultivated mind,” as she put it, persuaded me to focus on art history. My studies in college, and later in graduate school, completed my transformation from Project Boy to Cultured White Man. I was conditioned by my art history professors to believe that only the work of white people mattered. I engaged a mainstream art world — museums, galleries, collectors, and publishers — that viewed artists of color as sentimental or irrelevant at best, but more often as inept and dull. I eventually accepted these racist myths, even as I continued to live in the projects.

But I also experienced another awakening: I learned how to see.

My mentors in art history were rigorous and demanding, teaching me to visually analyze paintings and photographs, both to appreciate their aesthetics and to grasp their underlying cultural meaning. I was trained to “deconstruct” images, to evaluate the ways they advanced an agenda or manipulated or inspired viewers. But my teachers were oblivious to artists and photographers of color and work about race, a deficiency I inherited from them.

Yet my roots tugged at me as I started to miss the ardor and conviction of my youth. The art world that once seemed glamorous and exciting now was insufferable in its casual and deeply ingrained bigotry, elitism and allegiance to wealth. I picked up books by intellectuals ignored by my professors — brilliant race writers, like W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Frantz Fanon, who were deconstructing the world years before the scholars I had been assigned to read in school. I engaged new colleagues and researched new artists. And I began doing projects about race, relearning how to see and comprehend it through pictures.

In the summer of 2012, after a quarter century of publishing articles and books and curating exhibitions that reconciled the insights of my formal education with those of my life, I started writing Race Stories. I think of it as a learning experience, for me and the reader, fostering the racial and visual literacy denied me by my teachers.

My relationship with the art world remains tenuous. While some things have changed — art history has become more inclusive, for example, and a few artists of color have become superstars — the problem of racism persists. Recently, I attended a dinner in an expensive restaurant celebrating a friend’s New York museum retrospective, and the scene was typical and dispiriting: A sea of affluent white people dressed in black.

These days, I rarely go to events like this. In their segregation, they bring me back to the contentious lunchroom where, as a bewildered teenager, I pushed beyond the imposed limitations of my race. But in situations like this dinner, there is no “black side” to which I can retreat, no haven that even remotely resembles the life I lived or the one I live now.

In the slideshow above, the author selects and writes about some of his favorite photographs explored in the Race Stories series.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to believe that if a constructor goes to the trouble of making a puzzle that incorporates a particular shtick, there is a good reason for it. Perhaps a letter of the alphabet — the letter M, say — is special to this constructor, and he loves it so much he festoons not only his grid with it, but the clues as well (You did notice the clues, right?)

I would further like to believe that the reason the letter M is so special to this constructor is because his name begins with it. Or is in there somewhere. And yet here we have Clive Probert, who, as far as his byline in concerned, is completely M-less. So much for that theory.

Today’s Theme

It’s not hard to see that something is up, if you scan the clue list looking for gimmes before solving. Every clue in Mr. Probert’s puzzle begins with the letter M.

What is interesting in this puzzle is that every single one of the entries also has the letter M in it.

Setting constraints like these can lead to a lot of crossword glue, and they keep the constructor from adding really sparkling fill, because at that point, the constructor is just hoping that the grid fills acceptably. Mr. Probert gets the job done in that regard, and I liked that I learned the name of the “Muse of memory,” MNEME. From a cluing standpoint, the visual of the vertical line of M’s is nice, but the constraint makes some of the clues sound stilted. There’s definitely a place for puzzles like this once in a while.

Tricky Clues

The funny thing about today’s puzzle is that the “All clues begin with an M” and “All entries contain an M” constraints both helped and hindered my solve. If I didn’t immediately know the answer to the clue, knowing that the answer needed to contain an M helped me narrow things down quite a bit.

Ms. Mogherini said she wished to “condemn in the strongest possible way all attacks on Jews everywhere in the world, including in Europe and on Israel and on Israeli citizens.”

Among the European Union members, several smaller countries — including Hungary and the Czech Republic — favor a closer bond with Israel. Last week, the Czech Republic said it would consider moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem but then seemed to retreat, saying it accepted Israel’s sovereignty over only the western part of Jerusalem.

The Czech foreign minister, Lubomir Zaoralek, said on Monday that Mr. Trump’s announcement last week “can’t help us.”

“I am convinced that is it impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution,” Mr. Zaoralek said, according to Reuters, as he and other European foreign ministers gathered for breakfast with Mr. Netanyahu. “We are talking about an Israeli state, but at the same time a Palestinian state.”

The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the Europeans had been waiting several months for the new American plan, and were growing weary of waiting. “If one is not forthcoming,” he said, “the European Union will have to take the initiative.”

Some Israelis, who see a pro-Palestinian bias among many Europeans, have been angered by European moves such as requiring that goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank be clearly labeled with their provenance. Additionally, many European countries have been seeking closer ties with Iran since it reached a nuclear deal with the United States and other powers.",E.U.

Azu Nwagbogu, the festival’s founder and director, spoke with James Estrin about photography in Africa. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

What is your goal with the Lagos photo festival?

A.

I feel like photography has the power to make us understand the world better and to create empathy. So the goal is to have more visual storytellers telling more new stories to enable us to imagine a newer, better, richer, more prosperous, more safe, more empowered Africa.

In the past, the stories were told to create pity, and pity is an emotion that is not sustainable, that is easily dismissed, that does not allow us to understand or appreciate how to engage in that community. You just look away. And we are not trying to make people look away, we are trying to make people understand and invite them to share and to be part of that story.

Q.

How did you put together this year’s festival?

A.

The theme of the festival is Regimes of Truth. We are exploring a further understanding of the post-truth society that we live in. Now we are either inundated with so much information, or we have constructed another reality of what the truth is.

So it’s really looking at the way photography, the media and artists explore these notions of what is true and what is real. Because photography was founded on the science of observation, and it has always flattered itself to be a representative or an arbiter of truth.

In contemporary society, we now know that an image can be very deceptive and it can be propaganda. But at the same time we understand that visual language is becoming more decipherable by many more people, and that’s one of the reasons why I feel Africa is getting a lot of attention, mainly because of photography.

Photography created a pejorative view of the continent. Photography is also able to emancipate the impression that we have of Africa.

We have some really interesting work. Samuel Fosso’s “Black Pope” (Slide 7) explores the way religion and its symbols and objects that are used to create the narrative of a papal figure are so removed from the African context and culture that it almost promotes this idea of whiteness and white supremacy. In the history of the papacy, there has never been a black pope, while today the greatest number of Roman Catholics is actually in Africa.

Q.

In the 19th century, photography was thought to be scientifically accurate. Photojournalism still holds the conceit that one can be accurate in a sense. In a “post-truth” society, what does truth mean in relation to photography?

A.

I think through photography, especially photojournalism, we can sometimes establish the facts. When you have the facts, you can build on them and create the architecture that becomes the truth of the story.

Photojournalism is still very important in establishing the facts. How many people died, how many people traveled, who were the people in the room at that time. Photography can still do this. But to tell the story, you need to build a truth. But the truth is complex and the truth is something that we all search for. So I think that is always the balance between photography and visual culture.

Q.

How do you see the history of photography in Africa, and what is the role of photography in Africa today?

A.

It was photography that was used to create a dominant view for the colonizer over the Africans. And that is all about the colonizer with his hand over objects, or over his subjects. And it’s always about power, domination, control. So that’s really been the history of photography on the continent. It’s always been completely based on propaganda.

When we reflect on this in contemporary times, we want to reverse that.

We feel that sometimes we learn more through fiction than through what is considered to be factual. For example, the best information about Russia in the 19th century, when there was a lot of censorship, comes through fiction. So for us, it’s always finding that dance between the fictional and the factual. And also reclaiming African identity, which is really important to us.

We feel like we can’t use one approach. We have to adopt both. A lot of the fictive images seem to get more attention, but we have always had a strong documentary effort in the festivals.

Q.

Other than by exhibiting the stories, how do you build a culture and community of photographers to tell them? Or is that too elitist?

A.

No, I think that’s a mission of the festival. It’s always about building a community that has ownership, passion, and a feeling of adventure and camaraderie. We want to shape the way the stories that relate to Africa are told, and I think that’s really the most important thing that we can achieve. And that’s by shaping and expanding the community of visual storytellers.

One of the legacies of colonial intervention is a fragmentation of community. And where you have fragmentation of community it becomes harder to come together to grow.

We have conventional African storytellers trying to tell stories the way they think the West is interested in seeing the stories. There was not a community to support younger, contemporary visual storytellers on the continent who were trying to find their own voice, trying to find their own language, their own way, their own approach, their own unique, more knowledgeable perspective in telling stories that relate to Africa.

But when you have the community, there is a support for more nuanced, more honest, more true, more representative stories of contemporary Africa.

Photo

Q.

I see lot of work from Africa that is more in the art space and employs broader storytelling strategies. Is there a place in the Western media for African photographers? Or do they have to adjust or transform to fit that?

A.

I don’t think they need to transform. I keep hearing people say Africa seems to be in the news, to be hot, to be trending. I think it’s mainly because lots more people are able to tell their own stories and publish their own stories, by themselves, on social media. So that authorship, independent of the mainstream, has generated this interest in the unique voices and stories in Africa.

I don’t think there’s a real need to adapt or to change to a more understandable or decipherable visual language that the West is interested in. It’s more about developing an authentic voice and making sure that it’s consistent and coherent.

Q.

How?

A.

My message to practitioners on the continent is we shouldn’t follow Western journalism or art institutions, which are dominated by white males. Rather, we should innovate and find ways to be more representative, to include other voices. Media houses on the continent have to make sure they have as many women as men, and you have to make sure that you have women as editors. If you have enough diversity from the beginning, it makes it easier to make sure that you’re telling stories that are diverse, that are inclusive, that are more all embracing.

It’s really an exciting time on the continent — a lot is happening and a lot can still happen.

Q.

How about social class?

A.

Class is a massive problem in Africa, but the wonderful thing is that because of the communal nature of society, you’re never too far removed from those above and below you.

Class is always an issue in terms of breaking the mold and inviting more people to engage in the wider public discourse. That’s why contemporary art is so important. You come into an artist’s vision in public spaces where you have what I call interdependence — where people can agree or disagree, share ideas, in a very peaceful and a very safe zone with others of all classes. So there is really no need for conflict.

Q.

How are you bringing work to the public?

A.

We curate exhibitions in public spaces, like parks, where people can leave comments in any language about what they feel about the work. The most interesting comments we get are from people who might not feel comfortable in museums or galleries but feel very comfortable in parks.

Photo

Q.

How did you get involved in photography?

A.

Fifteen years ago when I was a writer and a scientist I realized that photography was the most powerful tool for visual storytelling, engagement and emancipation. And once I got into it I never looked back.

Q.

Were you ever a photographer?

A.

Not at all. I was more of a writer and curator. Those were my interests, my passion, so curating and writing is what I did.

Q.

The festival doesn’t only feature photographers who were born in Africa.

A.

Absolutely not. I think it’s really stupid that people sometimes question that. A lot of the work that exists on the continent has been made by photographers from elsewhere.

Sometimes the work is really, really good and meaningful and nuanced and well done, so why shouldn’t we show that? It’s empowering, and also it’s important that the local photographers see themselves as equals with anyone else. So that’s really the strength of the festival, is the fact that we do not isolate.

When it comes to empowering the continent, we do ourselves a disservice by saying, “You are not black enough” or “You are not African enough.” Because Africans go to Europe and improve the culture — evolve the culture, the language, the music, the art, the sport and everything else.

And when the reverse happens, we get scared or anxious about it. As long as we are shaping the narrative and we are not being overrun by the other voices, it’s important to invite many voices because it’s really about your sensibility, not the color of your skin.

But it’s always about work that relates to the continent. I would say that your color of skin is not important.

Photo

Q.

You talk about Africa, but what does Morocco have in common with Ethiopia, or Ghana? What do you mean when you say Africa?

A.

Africa is the most diverse continent on the planet. So our job really is to tell the stories of these various disparate communities. Presenting these wonderful diverse stories makes us richer.

I don’t think that I have one Africa. I’m a Pan-Africanist. I believe the Pan-Africanist approach is so much more interesting, more fun and more empowering, but at the same time we embrace the diversity across the continent because that makes us richer.

Q.

Then what is the commonality? That they were all colonies of Europe?

A.

Absolutely. The colonial history and the legacy have created a post-colonial continent with post-colonial trauma. We have the symptoms of trauma across the continent as a common theme. So I really don’t want to emphasize too much the negative, but people talk about colonization or colonialism as a stain, but it’s better understood as being actually woven into the very fabric of the continent.

Q.

Can that be transformed into something useful or positive?

A.

It must be, because decolonization starts by owning up to the fact that it’s already intricately woven into our DNA. And once you accept that position, then it empowers you to evolve from that.

When we think about art on the continent, the instinct is to look back. And that nostalgia for the past has kept the continent trapped in this loop.

We look back to before the colonialists’ intervention, to the masks, the sculptures, the objects. But we cannot go back to the masks. We love them, we think they’re beautiful and along with the pyramids they are a testament to the ingenuity of the people on the continent. But going back to that is almost like denying the fact that we have evolved and we are learning and we are able to take from the colonialists and shape a new language, shape a new culture. Because culture really is progressive if you want to find your peace, your balance, to feed your mind, to feed your soul in this world.

We want a future. You see the term Afrofuturism everywhere. We curated a show for the festival four years ago about Afrofuturism — Africans imagining a better future for themselves using technologies, many of which were not created on the continent.

So when you talk about colonization, it’s about saying, “We’re going to shape our future now.” And really shape and control every narrative.

You know the story of the hunt is told by the hunter. The lion will always be the victim. If the lion would be able to tell its own story, the story would be different.

It was the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, not Boston School of Fine Arts.","When Nan Goldin looks at the photographs that defined her career, she recites a little prayer to herself: “Send love to each person that’s dead.”

For 30 years, her subjects have been those closest to her: Transsexuals, cross-dressers, drug users, lovers, all people she befriended when she moved to New York after her sister’s suicide, a succession of foster homes and struggles with parents she rejected as conformists. They lived in what mainstream critics would coldly call the “margins of society,” and many died during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.

“They were family, a community,” she said. “And now most people are dead.”

All of these subjects and more are featured in “The Beautiful Smile,” a retrospective reissued by Steidl a decade after publication with Ms. Goldin’s Hasselblad award.

Born in the Washington, D.C. area, the youngest of four in a family she described as “intellectual and revisionist,” Ms. Goldin dreamed of New York City from childhood. After being expelled from several schools, leaving home and living with various foster families, she focused on her love of fashion photography and studied at the New England School of Photography and, later, at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There she met the drag queens who became her earliest subjects.

“I never realized until someone said it to me, that they were men dressed as women,” she said. “It never crossed my mind.”

Photo

It was her goal, at the time, to put the queens — who thrived in a nighttime underground community — on the cover of Vogue. Ms. Goldin’s hybrid of art photography and the snapshot aesthetic, autobiographical detail and documentary storytelling, was innovative at a time when most photographers had to choose between one or the other. Influenced most by Larry Clark’s “Tulsa,” an autobiographical body of work about troubled youth in his hometown, Ms. Goldin always found a way to put herself in the frame, sometimes physically.

In “Nan and Brian in bed,” or “the cover of everything,” as she calls it, Ms. Goldin is curled in a ball, clinging to her pillow, watching her then-boyfriend, Brian, smoke a cigarette, his bare back glowing in the heat and brilliance of the day’s last light.

“He broke my face,” said Ms. Goldin. “I still suffer from it.”

That was documented, too, in a self-portrait titled, “Nan one month after being battered.” (Slide 5) In it, she has impeccably tweezed eyebrows, nice jewelry and crimson lipstick – and two bruised eyes that stare blankly at the camera.

“I published the picture,” she explained, “so I would never go back to him.”

Other images show lovers, many of whom were in the slideshow that made her career, “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.” With couples, she explored the struggle between intimacy and autonomy, and the inevitable dependency that she feels comes with romantic relationships.

“Any lover relationship has that, particularly between men and women,” she said. “It’s a real struggle. I don’t feel it with my friends so much, and my friends are who I live with. They’re my emotional life.”

The publication of her retrospective book marks the end of one chapter in her life and the beginning of another: Ms. Goldin has moved on from photography. Instead, she has taken up painting.

“My work used to affect people who felt lost, showed them they weren’t alone,” she said. “Helped young ones. A gay boy from Turkey told me last month that I saved his life. This is what my work was meant to do.”

Not anymore. Now she feels her photos no longer help anyone. “Nor do my paintings, but they’re for me,” she said. “An unfamiliar landscape with an unknown language.” This is something of an emotional balm when she looks at her photographs taken over the decades.

“I lost most of my friends,” she said. “There’s a generation missing in the history of the 20th century.”

‘Rosehaven’ (SundanceNow) This Australian fishes-out-of-water comedy, created by its stars, Celia Pacquola and Luke McGregor, is about neurotic big-city best friends who find themselves running a family real-estate business in a small town in Tasmania. Affable and human, it’s the mirror-world version of terrible-twosome shows like “You’re the Worst” or “Catastrophe.”

‘Call My Agent!’ (Netflix) A show-business comedy about a boutique talent agency in Paris that seems to represent every French actor you’ve ever heard of, “Call My Agent!” is polished to a high shine and features the best as-themselves cameos — by a roster that includes Nathalie Baye, Isabelle Adjani and Juliette Binoche — since “The Larry Sanders Show.”

‘Norsemen’ (Netflix) A deadpan spoof of bloody, bawdy historical-ish dramas like “Vikings” and “Game of Thrones,” the Norwegian “Norsemen” puts contemporary words and ideas in the mouths and brains of 8th-century marauders to hilarious effect. (A chieftain returning from a raid beats a newly captured slave, then sadly reflects on the limits of “fear-based leadership.”) There’s some Monty Python here and a lot of “The Office,” with Kare Conradi marvelous in the role of the Viking village’s pusillanimous Michael Scott.

‘Line of Duty’ (Hulu) Hulu had a banner year for British shows with “Harlots” and “National Treasure,” but the fourth season of this perennial procedural favorite makes the list for Thandie Newton’s tightly wound performance as a detective suspected of cooking evidence. The plot takes some typically wild turns but Ms. Newton is believable in the most unlikely circumstances.

‘Stranger’ (Netflix) The murder mystery “Stranger” has less of the usual awkwardness and obviousness of many South Korean dramas as well as another big advantage: It stars the immensely likable Bae Doo-na as a fearless cop.

The 10 Best Shows That Ended in 2017

To qualify for this list, shows had to air an episode during the 2017 calendar year. This list does not include shows designed as one-season mini-series. Finally, this list considers the show’s entire existence, not just its swan song. — MARGARET LYONS

1. ‘The Leftovers’ (HBO) On “The Leftovers,” the weight of grief was so enormous it could bend truth. That’s how things wrapped up — as if things wrap up — for the endlessly evocative, almost too-beautiful series, with a finale that was truer than true. The tragic, captivating Nora (Carrie Coons) went to Australia, convinced a machine there could send her to the other side, the side where the 2 percent of the population that vanished in “the departure” now live. The side where her husband and children would be.

And maybe it worked, and maybe it didn’t, but what she did find — decades later, from half a world away — was her other husband, Kevin (Justin Theroux), handsome and compassionate. What do you do when nothing in the world makes sense the way it used to? The best you can, same as before.

2. ‘Please Like Me’ (Hulu) This Australian coming-of-age comedy blends its sweet disposition with its unsentimental view of the world, creating room for both darling goofballs and catastrophic depression. Many ensemble comedies are aspirational (“Friends,” say) and the ones that aren’t tend to be cynical (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”). “Please Like Me” is neither of those things. Instead, it’s thoughtful and welcoming, often hilarious and just oddball enough.

3. ‘American Crime’ (ABC) ABC was never going to be the right home for this bleak, substantive drama anthology, so the fact that it ran three seasons is some kind of blessing. Regina King won two Emmys for her performances on the show, and she should have won a third for this final season, where she played a devoted but weary social worker.

Photo

4. ‘Halt and Catch Fire’ (AMC) A so-so first season gave way to a gorgeous second, an aggressive third and this satisfying, confident fourth installment. The show followed the early days of personal computers, and despite occasional struggles to make forgone conclusions feel like real points of drama — are people really going to want to use “the internet?” — it always found deeper and more human stories beyond the clickety-clackety keyboards. The series blossomed narratively in Season 2, but it wasn’t until Season 4 that the show became its fully actualized self.

What “Halt and Catch Fire” understood better than most other shows is how people get stuck with one another. It’s not always out of adoration or compatibility. Sometimes the most potent kind of love is mutual passion.

5. ‘Girls’ (HBO) A lightning-rod show from before it even premiered, “Girls” died as it lived: surrounded by angry blog posts but also telling some stories in an extraordinarily deft fashion. The final-season episode “American Bitch,” a two-hander for guest-star Matthew Rhys and the show’s star and creator, Lena Dunham, was a late-in-the-game stunner, probing the cultural confusion around lecherous, literary men.

Photo

6. ‘Downward Dog’ (ABC) One might have guessed that a talking-dog show would not be long for this world, but one probably would not have guessed that the talking dog would sound like an anxious podcaster and be a wistful philosopher. “Downward Dog” only aired eight episodes, but that was enough to solidify its place in the one-and-done hall of fame. The show’s specialty was its tender approach to ordinariness, its baked-in knowledge that what makes a dog special — or an owner special, or a friend special — is that they’re yours.

7. ‘Orphan Black’ (BBC America) Clones, glorious clones. “Orphan Black” was the rare sci-fi thriller with an emotional core, thanks in large part to its star, Tatiana Maslany. Her fascinating, specific performances as several different characters breathed life and vitality into what can sometimes be a genre where construction matters more than execution. While the show’s intricate plotting could drift to the arcane, particularly in later seasons, the series never gave up its central humanity — or its occasional, welcome moments of humor.

8. ‘Underground’ (WGN) This historical drama about slavery and the Underground Railroad was frequently devastating and disturbing — and sometimes sudsy and juicy. But the standout episode by far was this season’s “Minty,” essentially a full-episode monologue performed by Aisha Hinds as Harriet Tubman. Other shows are not trying formats like this, and the untimely cancellation of “Underground” means we’re unlikely to see anything like it again any time soon.

9. ‘Playing House’ (USA) After an almost two-year hiatus, “Playing House” returned for a third season in 2017 — a season that lasted a mere four weeks. Thanks for nothing, USA. The comedy, created by and starring Jessica St. Clair and Lennon Parham, was gentle and goofy, and the Season 2 episode “Officer Of the Year” is arguably the best romantic comedy of the last several years.

10. (tie) ‘Sweet/Vicious’ and ‘Switched at Birth’ (MTV and Freeform) These shows are at opposite sides of the teen-TV spectrum: “Sweet/Vicious” was slick and snarky and barely eked out 10 episodes, while “Switched at Birth” could be painfully earnest and enjoyed a 104-episode run. But both were centrally attached to the idea of female companionship, and both told stories about young women being their own most capable advocates — particularly in the wake of assault, abuse or discrimination.",The Best TV Shows of 2017,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/arts/television/best-tv-shows.html

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus. To cancel your entry instead, press Escape.

So perhaps your daughter detours to law school to become a rainmaking corporate lawyer. Skies are cloudy in that profession, too. Any legal job that involves lots of mundane document review (and that’s a lot of what lawyers do) is vulnerable.

Software programs are already being used by companies including JPMorgan Chase & Company to scan legal papers and predict what documents are relevant, saving lots of billable hours. Kira Systems, for example, has reportedly cut the time that some lawyers need to review contracts by 20 to 60 percent.

As a matter of professional survival, I would like to assure my children that journalism is immune, but that is clearly a delusion. The Associated Press already has used a software program from a company called Automated Insights to churn out passable copy covering Wall Street earnings and some college sports, and last year awarded the bots the minor league baseball beat.

What about other glamour jobs, like airline pilot? Well, last spring, a robotic co-pilot developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, flew and landed a simulated 737. I hardly count that as surprising, given that pilots of commercial Boeing 777s, according to one 2015 survey, only spend seven minutes during an average flight actually flying the thing. As we move into the era of driverless cars, can pilotless planes be far behind?

Then there is Wall Street, where robots are already doing their best to shove Gordon Gekko out of his corner office. Big banks are using software programs that can suggest bets, construct hedges and act as robo-economists, using natural language processing to parse central bank commentary to predict monetary policy, according to Bloomberg. BlackRock, the biggest fund company in the world, made waves earlier this year when it announced it was replacing some highly paid human stock pickers with computer algorithms.

So am I paranoid? Or not paranoid enough? A much-quoted 2013 study by the University of Oxford Department of Engineering Science — surely the most sober of institutions — estimated that 47 percent of current jobs, including insurance underwriter, sports referee and loan officer, are at risk of falling victim to automation, perhaps within a decade or two.

Just this week, the McKinsey Global Institute released a report that found that a third of American workers may have to switch jobs in the next dozen or so years because of A.I.

I know I am not the only parent wondering if I can robot-proof my children’s careers. I figured I would start by asking my own what they want to do when they grow up.

Toby, a people pleaser and born entertainer, is obsessed with cars and movies. He told me he wanted to be either an Uber driver or an actor. (He is too young to understand that those jobs are usually one and the same).

As for Uber drivers, it is no secret that they are headed to that great parking garage in the sky; the company recently announced plans to buy 24,000 Volvo sport utility vehicles to roll out as a driverless fleet between 2019 and 2021.

And actors? It may seem unthinkable that some future computer-generated thespian could achieve the nuance of expression and emotional depth of, say, Dwayne Johnson. But Hollywood is already Silicon Valley South. Consider how filmmakers used computer graphics to reanimate Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin as they appeared in the 1970s (never mind that the Mr. Cushing died in 1994) for “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.”

My younger son Anton, a sweetheart, but tough as Kevlar, said he wanted to be a football player. Robot football may sound crazy, but come to think of it, a Monday night battle between the Dallas Cowdroids and Seattle Seabots may be the only solution to the sport’s endless concussion problems.

He also said he wanted to be a soldier. If he means foot soldier, however, he might want to hold off on enlistment. Russia recently unveiled Fedor, a humanoid robot soldier that looks like RoboCop after a Whole30 crash diet; this space-combat-ready android can fire handguns, drive vehicles, administer first aid and, one hopes, salute. Indeed, the world’s armies are in such an arms race developing grunt-bots that one British intelligence expert predicted that American forces will have more robot soldiers than humans by 2025.

And again, all of this stuff is happening now, not 25 years from now. Who knows what the jobs marketplace might look like by then. We might not even be the smartest beings on the planet.

Ever heard of the “singularity”? That is the term that futurists use to describe a potentially cataclysmic point at which machine intelligence catches up to human intelligence, and likely blows right past it. They may rule us. They may kill us. No wonder Mr. Musk says that A.I. “is potentially more dangerous than nukes.”

But is it really that dire? Fears of technology are as old as the Luddites, those machine-smashing British textile workers of the early 19th century. Usually, the fears turn out to be overblown.

The rise of the automobile, to cite the obvious example, did indeed put most manure shovelers out of work. But it created millions of jobs to replace them, not just for Detroit assembly line workers, but for suburban homebuilders, Big Mac flippers and actors performing “Greased Lightnin’” in touring revivals of “Grease.” That is the process of creative destruction in a nutshell.

But artificial intelligence is different, said Martin Ford, the author of “Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.” Machine learning does not just give us new machines to replace old machines, pushing human workers from one industry to another. Rather, it gives us new machines to replace us, machines that can follow us to virtually any new industry we flee to.

Since Mr. Ford’s book sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place, I reached out to him to see if he was concerned about all this for his own children: Tristan, 22, Colin, 17, and Elaine, 10.

He said the most vulnerable jobs in the robot economy are those involving predictable, repetitive tasks, however much training they require. “A lot of knowledge-based jobs are really routine — sitting in front of a computer and cranking out the same application over and over, whether it is a report or some kind of quantitative analysis,” he said.

Professions that rely on creative thinking enjoy some protection (Mr. Ford’s older son is a graduate student studying biomedical engineering). So do jobs emphasizing empathy and interpersonal communication (his younger son wants to be a psychologist).

Even so, the ability to think creatively may not provide ultimate salvation. Mr. Ford said he was alarmed in May when Google’s AlphaGo software defeated a 19-year-old Chinese master at Go, considered the world’s most complicated board game.

“If you talk to the best Go players, even they can’t explain what they’re doing,” Mr. Ford said. “They’ll describe it as a ‘feeling.’ It’s moving into the realm of intuition. And yet a computer was able to prove that it can beat anyone in the world.”

Looking for a silver lining, I spent an afternoon Googling TED Talks with catchy titles like “Are Droids Taking Our Jobs?”

In one, Albert Wenger, an influential tech investor, promoted the Basic Income Guarantee concept. Also known as Universal Basic Income, this sunny concept holds that a robot-driven economy may someday produce an unlimited bounty of cool stuff while simultaneously releasing us from the drudgery of old-fashioned labor, leaving our government-funded children to enjoy bountiful lives of leisure as interpretive dancers or practitioners of bee-sting therapy, as touted by Gwyneth Paltrow.

The idea is all the rage among Silicon Valley elites, who not only understand technology’s power, but who also love to believe that it will be used for good. In their vision of a post-A.I. world without traditional jobs, everyone will receive a minimum weekly or monthly stipend (welfare for all, basically).

Another talk by David Autor, an economist, argued that reports of the death of work are greatly exaggerated. Almost 50 years after the introduction of the A.T.M., for instance, more humans actually work as bank tellers than ever. The computers simply freed the humans from mind-numbing work like counting out 20-dollar bills to focus on more cognitively demanding tasks like “forging relationships with customers, solving problems and introducing them to new products like credit cards, loans and investments,” he said.

Computers, after all, are really good at some things and, for the moment, terrible at others. Even Anton intuits this. The other day I asked him if he thought robots were smarter or dumber than humans. “Sdumber,” he said after a long pause. Confused, I pushed him. “Smarter and dumber,” he explained with a cheeky smile.

He was joking. But he also happened to be right, according to Andrew McAfee, a management theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whom I interviewed a short while later.

Discussing another of Anton’s career aspirations — songwriter — Dr. McAfee said that computers were already smart enough to come up with a better melody than a lot of humans. “The things our ears find pleasant, we know the rules for that stuff,” he said. “However, I’m going to be really surprised when there is a digital lyricist out there, somebody who can put words to that music that will actually resonate with people and make them think something about the human condition.”

Not everyone, of course, is cut out to be a cyborg-Springsteen. I asked Dr. McAfee what other jobs may exist a decade from now.

“I think health coaches are going to be a big industry of the future,” he said. “Restaurants that have a very good hospitality staff are not about to go away, even though we have more options to order via tablet.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — I’m sure you all read the constructor’s notes that appear on these posts; one of the things that always strikes me is how long it can take to usher a puzzle from conception to publication. When you look at the newspaper you’re holding in your hands, literally or virtually, some days the crossword is probably its most long-deliberated component.

Not so today, as David J. Kahn has built his grid around a record-breaking purchase, involving a jaw-dropping amount of money, that happened just a few weeks ago and is still an intriguing (and possibly unfinished) story. We eat this stuff up, don’t we? I thought I’d dust off some old Gilded Age anecdotes for this post but upon googling “ostentatious displays of wealth” found myself sinking into a truffle-scented morass of modern day Caligulas watering their golf courses using golden blimps filled with Evian water and hiring someone to “do” their dishes by flinging dirty ones into the trash and bringing in new sets for every meal.

Today’s Theme

38A is the central theme answer to this puzzle. The painting in question is Leonard da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi,” or “Savior of the World,” and it is the most expensive painting ever sold by a country mile, assuming that country is in OPEC. The back story is pretty thrilling if you don’t know it. I confess I sort of glazed over the whole thing when it happened, but suffice to say someone bought this exact same painting in 1958 for 45 British pounds. Also, it depicts Jesus, head on, and it really seems as if he’s just about to say “if you’re not worth billions, don’t even look at me.” Actually, that’s not true. But the whole convergence is very dissonant.

If you’re knowledgeable about art and the auction world you’ll have no problems with the other seven themed entries in this grid. The artist of the painting runs directly down the middle at 7D, forming a cross with the painting’s name, and there are entries at 14A, 65A, 10D, 12D, 35D and 60D. The strategy required to make all these clues show up in perfect symmetry makes this puzzle really lovely, a little work of art. Who can spare a hundred mil or two for Mr. Kahn?

The China Mobile document said that a manager of the company inspected five sites on Dec. 2 at the request of the Changbai County government.

The company was asked to ensure there was viable internet service in the areas that would be used for the camps. “Because the situation on the China-North Korea border has intensified lately, Changbai County government plans to set up five refugee sites in Changbai,” China Mobile said in the document.

The areas designated for the refugee camps were on state-owned land, and temporary housing had already been constructed at several sites, according to a local businessman who requested anonymity for fear of angering the local government.

Three county villages were named in the document as locations for the camps. The cities of Tumen and Hunchun will also house refugees, according to the businessman.

Tumen and Hunchun have for 20 years received defectors, who have managed to escape from North Korea into China. Many of those defectors travel on to Southeast Asia and eventually to South Korea.

Jilin Province is about 60 miles from Punggye-ri, the main North Korean nuclear test site. Fears of a nuclear war, or disaster, just miles away have set residents of the province on edge.

Last week, the Jilin Daily, a provincial newspaper, advised residents on how to react in case of a nuclear explosion or radioactive fallout.

The advice included washing off radioactive dust from exposed body parts and shoes, and taking iodine tablets. The article noted that when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, more than 70,000 people were killed. Modern weapons are many times more powerful.

China has refrained from imposing overly punitive sanctions on North Korea for fear of causing a collapse that would result in refugees flooding the economically vulnerable northeast. So far, China has resisted calls to cut off oil to North Korea, a move that would result in severe deprivation resulting in many people crossing the border.

Although China does not appear to have changed its basic position on maintaining stability, the increasingly hostile talk in Washington appears to be spurring contingency preparations.

Zheng Zeguang, the vice minister of foreign affairs, rushed to Washington last week to discuss what Chinese officials call the “black hole of confrontation” between the United States and North Korea.

As a result of the rising tensions, one of China’s most prominent experts on North Korea, called building the camps “absolutely reasonable.”

“It is highly possible that there is a conflict between North Korea and the United States now,” said Zhang Liangui, a professor of international strategic research at the Communist Party’s Central Party School. “What China does here is to be prepared for any kind of situation happening on the Korean Peninsula.”

In another sign of increased tensions, South Korea said on Monday that it would join the United States and Japan for a drill to practice tracking missiles launched from North Korean submarines.

Last month, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that flew higher and longer than its previous tests. The North said that the missile could deliver nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental United States.","Fearing the Worst, China Plans Refugee Camps on North Korean Border",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/asia/china-north-korea-border.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Gab, which claims to have more than 300,000 registered users, was supposed to be an alt-tech success story. The service attracted reams of attention when it launched last year, and it raised more than $1 million in a crowdfunding campaign, making it the rare alt-tech platform with significant resources. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s chief operating officer, told Slate this year that the company was starting an organization called the “Free Speech Tech Alliance,” and had recruited more than 100 Silicon Valley engineers to help.

But today, Gab is buggy and confusing, and much of the activity on the site appears to come from a small core of frequent users. Several of the well-known figures who once posted on the site have abandoned it. (“I’m a creature of habit, and fell out of habit of posting there,” Mike Cernovich, a notorious right-wing media personality, told me.) The site also had its own censorship drama earlier this year, after moderators removed a post that mocked Heather Heyer, the activist killed during the Charlottesville protests.

Gab’s founder, Andrew Torba, declined to comment on the site’s progress, telling me in a Gab message that “I don’t do interviews with fake news outlets.”

Instead, I spoke with Cody Wilson, a developer in Texas who is behind another alt-tech service. Mr. Wilson’s product, a crowdfunding site called Hatreon, was meant to give alt-right personalities and others a way to raise money for projects deemed too risqué for mainstream crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon and Kickstarter.

Hatreon got off to a fast start, with more than 400 creators raising about $25,000 per month on the platform. But lately, it has fallen into disrepair. According to Mr. Wilson, a major credit card company, which he declined to name, kicked Hatreon off its network last month, preventing many users from funding projects on the site and all but killing the company’s prospects for growth. Today, visitors to Hatreon are greeted by a message saying that “pledging is currently disabled while we upgrade our systems.”

Mr. Wilson, who does not describe himself as alt-right, said he has accepted that building a viable alt-tech business might be impossible, given the practical constraints.

“I don’t understand how any of them plan to be profitable,” he said.

Things aren’t going much better for WrongThink, which went online in late 2016 with aspirations of becoming a free-speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter. A year later, WrongThink has only about 7,000 registered members, according to the site’s founder, who goes by the username Bane Biddix.

Far-right activists have been trying to build alternative tech platforms for years, with little success. A decade ago, white nationalist websites with names like New Saxon and PodBlanc sprang up to compete with Myspace, Friendster, and the other social giants of the era. But most of those sites fizzled when their creators ran out of money or got into legal trouble. And none came close to reaching a large mainstream audience.

Granted, it is still the early days for this new wave of services, which are coming of age during the Trump years and could benefit from changing norms around P.C. culture and acceptable speech. Some alt-right leaders are hopeful that a coming “purge” on Twitter — their phrase for a change in the site’s hate speech policies, which Twitter plans to enforce beginning next week — will send scores of disgruntled users scurrying to alt-tech platforms.

But Mark Pitcavage, who studies right-wing extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, told me that alt-tech companies face several structural barriers. Not only do they have to build a compelling product and attract users — a steep challenge even in the best of circumstances — but they must do it without access to mainstream funding sources, such as venture capital firms and angel investors, which provide much of the fuel for other tech start-ups. They also rely on finding companies that are willing to host their services and process their payments.

“Being on the internet is a group venture,” Mr. Pitcavage said. “You rely on an internet service provider, a domain name service, a credit card processor. It’s a very common thing for one or more of these entities not to want to do business with a white supremacist group.”

There is also a talent shortage among alt-tech companies, many of which rely on volunteers, and few of which can afford to pay the kinds of salaries demanded by top-tier programmers.

“Speaking frankly, you’re not getting 10x engineer talent with these people,” said Mr. Wilson of Hatreon, using a popular Silicon Valley term for a star employee. “No one’s lining up for this.”

Alt-tech is also a victim of the same market forces that have held back other small tech start-ups. Much of the internet’s basic architecture is controlled by a handful of gatekeepers — Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon among them. Those companies run back-end services that allow developers to build reliable products, the app stores that allow them to reach a mass audience, and the advertising platforms that allow them to make money. Without the support of Silicon Valley’s giants, it’s nearly impossible to compete, no matter what your political views are.

“If someone with sufficient money and determination magically materialized, I’m not saying it’s impossible, but even then it wouldn’t be easy,” Mr. Pitcavage said.

The good news for the alt-right’s detractors, then, is that the movement’s vision of a flourishing parallel internet seems doomed to fail.

The bad news is that, without a functional alternate ecosystem, it may be harder to quarantine the views of neo-Nazis and other noxious ideologues to little-used corners of the internet, far from the vast majority of users. Facebook, Twitter, and other mainstream services will continue to be the dominant venue for ideological battles, and keeping these platforms free of hate and misinformation will remain those companies’ responsibility.

Let’s not let last week pass without mention of one bit of important California history. It was 50 years ago when Willie Brown, the San Francisco Democrat, was first elected to the Assembly. It’s almost a cliché to say they don’t make them like that anymore — well it is a cliché, but so what. They don’t.

Mr. Brown held office before California voters adopted term limits, which meant he was able to serve 15 years leading the Assembly. All those years meant that Mr. Brown had the kind of knowledge, connection and experience that helped make him one of the most powerful leaders in California history.

And his career kept going after he left Sacramento. He became mayor of San Francisco and today, at 83, he is writing political columns for the San Francisco Chronicle, where, characteristically, he has shown no reluctance in letting you know how he thinks. “Democrats needed the high road, so they ran over Al Franken,” read the headline over Mr. Brown’s weekend offering.

A very worthy, second New York Times Crossword outing from Lily Silverstein, with a central seed entry that will no doubt provoke some discussion. But that’s what we’re here for, isn’t it?

For those of you just joining us, a seed entry is a word or phrase that a constructor believes will make a lively start to the fill in a puzzle. The rest of the fill is built around it, and the seed entry typically gets a prominent place in the grid.

Today’s seed entry, according to Ms. Silverstein, is the central entry GENDER ROLES, clued as “Parts played on classic sitcoms?” Some solvers might discuss the entry because of the evolving nature of gender roles in society, but personally, I was more curious about the question mark at the end of the clue. It seemed to me that the clue would work just as well without a “?” but that was only on my first reading.

A “?” at the end of a clue typically means the clue cannot be taken at face value. It also means a clue is stretching beyond a single reality: Today, we’re not talking about literal roles or parts being played, but the fact that in old or “classic” sitcoms, people usually adhered to then-stereotypical gender roles, like the stay-at-home mom who raised the children or the beleaguered dad who worked outside the home. In an email, editor Will Shortz also remarked that “a secondary reason is the clue’s inexactness. It might not always be true. A question mark in a clue sometimes substitutes for ‘maybe’ or ‘perhaps.’”",A Story With an Apple,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2017-12-01.html

In 2002, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, gave a laudatory speech at the 100th-birthday party of fellow Republican Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. “I want to say this about my state: When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him,” Lott said. “We’re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn’t have had all these problems over all these years, either.”

Thurmond had run for president in 1948 as a pro-segregation Dixiecrat, declaring: “There’s not enough troops in the Army to force the Southern people to break down segregation and admit the Negro race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes and into our churches.” For celebrating him, Lott had to resign his leadership position. His words, the right-wing pundit Charles Krauthammer wrote then, were “evidence of a historical blindness that is utterly disqualifying for national office.”

At the time, many conservatives and Republicans had been trying for more than a decade to scrub the stink of racism off their movement. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush denounced David Duke, the Republican candidate for Louisiana governor, for his bigotry and Nazi sympathy. That year the Republican National Committee chairman, Lee Atwater, dying of a brain tumor, apologized for his race-baiting Willie Horton ads. Before the decade was through, Ralph Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition, apologized for white evangelicals’ “shameful legacy of racism” and indifference to the civil rights movement. By 2002, with George W. Bush presiding over the most ethnically diverse Republican administration ever, conservatives saw Lott’s nostalgia for segregation as very much off brand.

Since the election of Donald Trump, however, opposition to overt racism, like free trade and supply-side economics, has been revealed as an elite Republican preoccupation with questionable currency among the conservative base. The president’s supporters celebrate his racial demagogy as a refreshing rejection of political correctness; they stood by him when he referred to some of the white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, Va., as “very fine people.” Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, has felt liberated to let his fascist flag fly, recently tweeting a quote from Hungary’s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban: “Mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.” And as we approach Tuesday’s special Senate election in Alabama, the president has thrown his support behind Roy Moore, an apologist for slavery.

Moore’s record of alleged sexual assaults of underage girls has understandably overshadowed his many other disqualifications for high office. Still, his repulsive racial views also deserve our attention. In September, The Los Angeles Times reported on a rally where an African-American man asked Moore when America was last great. “I think it was great at the time when families were united — even though we had slavery — they cared for one another,” he responded. If Trump wants to return America to the 1950s, Moore would prefer the 1850s.

Moore’s affection for the America of chattel slavery was shocking but not surprising, because he has long palled around with white nationalists. In both 2009 and 2010, Moore’s Foundation for Moral Law hosted pro-Confederate Alabama “Secession Day” celebrations. On Monday, CNN unearthed two 2011 interviews Moore did on the far-right radio show “Aroostook Watchmen,” in which he said that getting rid of every constitutional amendment after the 10th would “eliminate many problems.” He was particularly contemptuous of the 14th Amendment, adopted to give former slaves equal rights under the law.",The White Supremacy Caucus,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/opinion/white-supremacy-caucus.html

Three years ago, Mr. Nisman was set to testify to the country’s Congress on Ms. Kirchner’s role in the cover up. The day before his testimony, on Jan. 18, 2015, he was found dead in his apartment in Buenos Aires, with a bullet in his head. This, despite the fact that he had a 10-man security detail paid to protect him.

Within hours, Ms. Kirchner announced that Mr. Nisman had committed suicide. In the days that followed, she strangely claimed his death was part of a lovers’ spat. Finally, she changed her story once more: His death may have been the result of rogue intelligence operatives.

When we heard the news of Mr. Nisman’s death and of Ms. Kirchner’s suspected cover-up, we were horrified, but not entirely shocked. Anyone who had followed Mr. Nisman’s pursuit of this case knew that he was assuming grave risks by taking on both a terrorist state and his own government. Through a decade of investigation, Mr. Nisman received death threats against not only him but his children as well. One email he told us about had a picture of bloodied and brutalized bodies lying on the ground, with a note saying this would be the fate of his young daughters if he did not cease his investigation.

None of it stopped him. Fearless and resolute, Mr. Nisman and his team had determined that former Iranian and Hezbollah officials planned the AMIA attack. He was able to show definitively that the plan included no less than Iran’s former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; its minister of intelligence; its foreign minister; the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; the head of the corps’ elite Quds force; the Iranian cultural attaché in Argentina; and the third secretary at Iran’s Embassy in Buenos Aires, as well as the former head of Hezbollah’s external security. His investigation led Interpol to issue red notices — akin to international arrest warrants — against six of the perpetrators. Argentina itself issued arrest warrants for Mr. Rafsanjani and Ali Akbar Velayati, then foreign minister, which Iran predictably disregarded.

But Mr. Nisman did not stop there.

In May 2013, he released a 500-page indictment outlining how Iran had penetrated not just Argentina, but also Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Paraguay, Trinidad, Tobago and Suriname, and how it used mosques, social service organizations and its own embassies to radicalize and recruit terrorists. Mr. Nisman also shared information that helped American authorities determine that Mohsen Rabbani, the Iranian embassy cultural attaché and one of the AMIA bombing masterminds, helped four men, including his disciple, a Guyanese official named Abdul Kadir, plot to blow up the fuel lines at Kennedy International Airport in New York. Mr. Kadir is serving a life sentence in the United States for the foiled plot, which could have led to the loss of countless lives.

In a normal democracy, investigating the murder of a man like Alberto Nisman would be a top priority. But Ms. Kirchner and her allies assured that justice for Mr. Nisman’s murder was stymied for years.

That changed three months ago, when, under Argentina’s new president, Mauricio Macri, a fresh investigation by the Argentine national police found that Mr. Nisman had been drugged with Ketamine, a drug used to sedate animals, then brutally beaten before he was shot in the head.

The case against Ms. Kirchner is based on more than 40,000 legal wiretaps and other evidence, much of it collected by Mr. Nisman, which reveals a secret backchannel between her government and Iran. On Ms. Kirchner’s personal orders, she and her associates used the backchannel to negotiate a public memorandum of understanding that would purportedly have the two countries establish a “truth commission” to jointly identify the culprits of the bombing. Mr. Nisman believed it was designed to expunge the Interpol red notices against the plot’s perpetrators.

One thing is entirely clear: Ms. Kirchner and her allies went to great lengths to establish this backchannel. For example, in 2011, Mr. Timerman, Ms. Kirchner’s foreign minister, made a secret trip to Syria to iron out the plan with Ali Akbar Salehi, then Iran’s foreign minister. This trip was revealed earlier this year by a former Argentine ambassador to Syria in court testimony. Further implicating Ms. Kirchner and Mr. Timerman is a voice recording of him acknowledging Iran’s responsibility in the bombing.

Ramón Allan Bogado, who claims to be a one-time Argentine intelligence agent and is one of those recently indicted, testified last month that the backchannel included an arrangement for Argentina to provide Iran with nuclear technology, with front companies in Argentina and Uruguay to conduct the transactions. He alleged that officials at the highest levels of Argentina’s government were aware of the scheme. If true, this would be even worse than Mr. Nisman had uncovered and may provide a further explanation about why someone wanted him dead.

The judge in the case has asked the Argentine Congress, where Ms. Kirchner serves as a recently elected senator, to strip her of immunity so that she can be arrested and tried. But regardless of what happens to her, Argentina is on track to make amends for more than two decades of gross injustice. President Macri has abandoned Ms. Kirchner’s revisionist history of the 1994 bombing, and he supports an independent investigation that would finally identify who ordered Alberto Nisman’s death.

But President Macri has more challenges ahead. As Mr. Nisman documented, Iran and Hezbollah have penetrated Latin America, and still pose a grave threat to the security of Argentina, the region and the United States.",Iranian Terror.

MONDAY PUZZLE — Here’s a hot take: From my constructing experience, I find Monday crosswords the hardest to create. A quintessential early-week offering should have a theme simple enough to draw in new solvers, yet interesting enough to captivate the regular audience. Not only is this balance difficult to achieve, but originality is still as important as it is with other puzzles. Finally, there’s a major emphasis on the fill being widely familiar to all; a tough crossing may pop up on a weekend puzzle, but this is essentially taboo for Monday.

Although Alan Arbesfeld is best known for constructing midweek and Sunday puzzles, he executes the above concepts well for a textbook Monday solve. And it’s no wonder; this is Mr. Arbesfeld’s 119th crossword in The New York Times, making him one of the most prolific constructors since Will Shortz became puzzles editor in 1993.

On Tuesday we’ll learn whether Alabama voters care if their next U.S. senator is an accused pedophile with a long history of dating teens when he was in his 30s.

History would suggest … not so much.

Roy Moore hasn’t pulled out a gun at any rallies lately, but he’s still the person you’d least like your daughter to run into in the Gadsden Mall. Women have charged, with what seems like extreme credibility, that he sexually assaulted them when they were 14 and 16. You’d think that would be enough to do him in.

Yet the chronicles of American politics are absolutely stuffed with stories about politicians who shocked their constituents with bad behavior, generally along the sexual line, without being punished at the polls.

At this very moment, the House of Representatives includes Scott DesJarlais, a physician and a staunch opponent of abortion rights, who was given a new term after voters learned he had dated his patients while still married to his first wife and pressured one of them to get — yes! — an abortion.

If horror movies were some of the year’s most illuminating, they were also some of the year’s cleverest and most fun.","Let’s say that this year things were normal, that we missed the news about hurricanes and earthquakes and wildfires, knew nothing about men sexually harassing actresses, Capitol Hill staffers, journalists and teenage Alabama girls, nothing about bombings and massacres and never-ending refugee crises, nothing about the creep toward nuclear war and the dangers of a warming planet, nothing of the lava flowing from our president’s Twitter account. What story would we come up with to explain why horror films grossed more than a billion dollars in 2017? Horror movies probably don’t need the world to be horrifying to be good. But when things are bad, the genre has a way of telling you they could be worse.

There’s a difference, of course, between being scared for fun and actually fearing for your life, your country, the future of humanity. But the thrill of horror movies has always been their grasp on collective nightmares. Horror is effective partly because it’s never new. We’ve always seen boogeymen in the movies. Now we’re seeing boogeymen at the office, in the government, at the comedy club, doing the news. Some of what drew us to the genre this year might have been the urge to have our worst fears realized and to see whether the movies could upstage reality by reflecting it. Their darkness was a respite from our own.

Led by the surprise blockbuster “Get Out,” the horror movies of 2017 offer up reliable pleasures — jump scares, creaky door hinges, lonely houses late at night — while playing with our expectations. “Get Out” invented mind-blowing metaphors for racism. “It” refashioned a shopworn fear of clowns so that their viciousness felt like news. In “Split,” a trio of young women trapped in a basement work together to get free of the basket case imprisoning them. A metaphor, perhaps? Even “Happy Death Day,” with its heroine who keeps dying until she figures out who’s killing her, seems right on time: Her horror movie might never end. And as bad as “Friend Request” is (very, very), it arrived with the tag line of the year: “Evil is trending.” Because, well, it is.

Like the superhero genre, horror is somewhat allegorical, a way of giving shape to abstractions. Monsters, demons, ghosts, psycho killers, that homicidal clown all pop out of the Pandora’s box of the collective unconscious, as our tormentors and our proxies. For all the supernaturalism attached to horror, the real source of the terror is usually us — or folks more or less like us. Ghosts and zombies are nothing more than former people (a point made with metaphysical wit in David Lowery’s mopey art house film “A Ghost Story”). Regular living humans turn out to be capable of diabolical cruelty (the point of “Get Out”) and coldblooded self-preservation (the revelation of “It Comes at Night”).

If horror movies were some of the year’s most illuminating, they were also some of the year’s cleverest and most fun. So we asked the actors who gave this year’s greatest performances — including Daniel Kaluuya, Nicole Kidman, Cynthia Nixon, Andy Serkis, Jake Gyllenhaal and Tiffany Haddish — to interpret the genre’s archetypes. Duck under a bedsheet, slip in a set of fangs, smear on some makeup, lose your mind and “Boo!”: You’ve captured 2017. But, of course, these performers had already done that, in movies that offered relief and enlightenment as well as terror. They played sensitive primates and brilliant poets, ordinary heroes and exceptional children, best friends and beguilers in movies that were funny, sad, sweet and revelatory. What’s truly scary about them is their talent, commitment and craft.",Fright Club,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/07/magazine/great-performers-horror-show-photos.html

Photo ID laws are written to make it difficult for people like them to vote. And that’s exactly what happens. A study by Zoltan Hajnal, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, comparing the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, found that the voter ID law kept black voters from the polls. After Alabama implemented its strict voter ID law, turnout in its most racially diverse counties declined by almost 5 percentage points, which is even more than the drop in diverse counties in other states.

The study controls for numerous factors that might otherwise affect an election: how much money was spent on the races; the state’s partisan makeup; changes in electoral laws like early voting and day-of registration; and shifts in incentives to vote, like which party controls the state legislature.

In Alabama, an estimated 118,000 registered voters do not have a photo ID they can use to vote. Black and Latino voters are nearly twice as likely as white voters to lack such documentation.

In other words, Alabama’s law is nothing but a naked attempt to suppress the voting rights of people of color. That’s why my organization, Greater Birmingham Ministries, with the help of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, has sued the state to block the photo ID law. The case will go to trial in February.

When the law was passed in 2011, it so reeked of discrimination that state politicians didn’t bother to submit it to the federal government for approval, as Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required. For decades, Section 5 had acted as a crucial prophylactic, stopping discriminatory voting laws before any election. Instead the ID law remained dormant until June 2013, when the Supreme Court’s devastating ruling in Shelby County v. Holder suspended Section 5’s preclearance requirement.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a United States senator, applauded the ruling as “good news” for the South. For Mr. Sessions, who called the Voting Rights Act an “intrusive” piece of legislation, it was a victory. But for voters in Alabama and the rest of the South, it was terrible news.

It left states like Alabama, Texas and North Carolina free to test the limits of voter suppression. Indeed, after the decision, Alabama announced the photo ID law would go into effect without federal approval.

The photo ID law isn’t the only obstacle in front of Alabama voters. My organization is also challenging the state’s felon disfranchisement law, which affects an estimated 250,000 people here — 15 percent of Alabama’s black voting age population, but fewer than five percent of whites.

The law bars people with felonies of “moral turpitude” from voting. For decades such crimes were ill defined, but once included things like miscegenation. A new law narrowed the list of disfranchising crimes, but a federal judge ruled this summer that the state is not required to inform people with convictions who couldn’t vote under the old law that they may now register to vote.

Sadly, on Tuesday, many of the voters who would most benefit from picking lawmakers who will represent their interests in the Senate will be kept away from the polls. Those voters are disparaged for their purported disengagement with the election, while the state’s voter suppression campaign is largely ignored.

Season 8, Episode 8: ‘How It’s Gotta Be’

As the eighth season of “The Walking Dead” has sunk itself into the “All Out War” story line and the extended conflict with Negan, the writing staff has entered into an unspoken understanding with its patient audience. This season has gotten repeatedly bogged down by chatter, positioning and repositioning characters for an impending reckoning. When a show makes the choice to frame so much of itself as anticipatory, it had better have the firepower to back up that promise. But much in the same way that leaders on both sides have reneged on their social contracts by neglecting to protect their followers, the writers have punished viewers with inertia and bitter nihilism.

After seven episodes of strategizing and interminably unproductive conversations about the value of life in times of crisis, the series has sputtered right when it should’ve begun roaring. The episode begins promisingly enough, as Negan mounts a counteroffensive just as it looked as if Rick’s coalition was seizing the upper hand. The script clearly establishes what’s at stake and assigns a timeline: Negan’s got the alliance’s compound surrounded, and they’ve got three minutes to surrender before the rocket-propelled grenades start flying. He goes the shock-and-awe route, flatly informing his enemies that “you lose, it’s over.” On all of this war’s multiple fronts — the Sanctuary, the road where Simons halts Maggie, the Savior refuge — Negan threatens to grasp the upper hand. His lieutenants spread themselves smartly and neutralize many of the threats before matters can get dire enough to require gunfire.

But it’s all in service of a climax that never arrives. Even at a bloated 90-minute run time, this week’s episode lacks the sense of momentousness that a midseason finale ought to possess. Perhaps the writers intend to save Rick’s inevitable showdown with Negan for the proper season finale, but all the same, they cannot muster a suitably dramatic substitute. This episode treads the same drawn-out, unaffecting path as so many have this season, briefly checking in with an array of minor players without crafting a particularly engaging character beat for any of them. The episode carries that splintered vantage into the final scenes, which divide attentions among multiple fronts through crosscutting that fails to produce the emotional response it’s looking for.

Within this fractured schematic, an unusual quotient of attention gets paid to young Carl in an instant sign of doom. It happened to Ezekiel before he lost his cherished tiger, it happened to Eugene before a complete internal break that sends him to the brink of suicide in this episode, and it happens to poor Carl when he attempts to make one last-ditch attempt at decency. In the post-apocalyptic wasteland, hopeful statements ring out like a death knell.

And indeed, the final moments reveal that Carl has been bitten by a Walker and his days are numbered. (Actor Chandler Riggs has confirmed that we haven’t seen the last of Carl; he’ll return when the series gets back up and running on Feb. 25, 2018 for a final goodbye.) Rick’s unmoored son finds purpose in mending the fences between the warring groups by any means necessary, no matter how extreme. In the episode’s most resonant scene, Carl takes it upon himself to barter peace and offers himself as a sacrificial lamb. It’s a naïve move, and Carl’s reasoning — that he can prevent any other deaths by causing his own — doesn’t quite stand up to scrutiny. But he succeeds in earning Negan’s respect with his chutzpah. More than that, he proves to the audience that he might be more than the whiny-voiced kid who spent years as an albatross around his father’s neck.

He won’t get the chance, however. The writers have cut down Carl in his prime, a break from the comics with no discernible rationale apart from a streak of moral sadism, determinedly quashing any flickers of hope. The series has long equated goodness with weakness, a bitter pose neither entertaining nor deep. Carl was one of the last remaining vestiges of the former world’s standards for ethical behavior, having helped the ailing Siddiq earlier this season when Rick regarded that man as too risky or burdensome to take on. Carl’s kinder tendencies have been a peg on which viewers could hang their hopes for a livable future, and the sting from having that possibility snatched away lingers.

Episodes like this week’s, which appear to take a perverse pleasure in dangling the possibility of salvation only to snatch it away, call into question the relationship between the show and its fan base. “The Walking Dead” has evinced a bleak pessimism since its earliest episodes, but previous seasons have situated the misery in a meaningful context. Somewhere around the shameless manipulation of Abraham’s cliffhanger death at the close of the sixth season, however, sadness became a blunt-force weapon that the show has wielded carelessly.","‘The Walking Dead’ Season 8, Episode 8: The Sacrificial Lamb",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/arts/television/the-walking-dead-recap-how-its-gotta-be-carl-bit.html

Second, today’s radicalism is more about identity than social problems.

Both the Trumpian populists and the social justice warriors are more intent on denouncing the people they hate than on addressing the concrete problems before them.

Third, today’s radicalism assumes that war is the inherent state of things.

The key influence here is Saul Alinsky. His 1971 book, “Rules for Radicals,” has always been popular on the left and recently it has become fashionable with the Tea Party and the alt-right. One of his first big assertions is that life is warfare. It is inevitably a battle between the people and the elites, the haves and the have-nots, or, as his heirs would add, between the whites and the blacks, the Republicans and the Democrats, Islam and the West. If you’re not willing to treat life as an endless war you’re a cuck.

Fourth, there is the low view of human nature.

Today’s radicals conduct themselves on the presumption that since life is battle, moral decency is mostly a hypocritical fraud. To get anything done the radical has to commit evil acts for good causes. “The ethics of means and ends is that in war the end justifies almost any means,” Alinsky writes. “Ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with the times,” he adds.

“Ethics are determined by whether one is losing or winning.” That sentence could have been uttered by Donald Trump, but it was really written by Saul Alinsky.

What can we conclude about the radicals?

Well, they are wrong that our institutions are fundamentally corrupt. Most of our actual social and economic problems are the bad byproducts of fundamentally good trends.

Technological innovation has created wonders but displaced millions of workers. The meritocracy has unleashed talent but widened inequality. Immigration has made America more dynamic but weakened national cohesion. Globalization has lifted billions out of poverty but pummeled the working classes in advanced nations.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What’s needed is reform of our core institutions to address the bad byproducts, not fundamental dismantling.

That sort of renewal means doing the opposite of everything the left/right radicals do. It means believing that life can be more like a conversation than a war if you open by starting a conversation. It means collectively focusing on problems and not divisively destroying people. It means believing that love is a genuine force in human affairs and that you can be effective by appealing to the better angels of human nature.

Today’s radicalism is fundamentally spiritual, even if it’s played out in the political sphere. It’s driven by the radicals’ need for more secure identity, to gain respect and dignity, to give life a sense of purpose and meaning.

The radicals are looking for meaning and purpose in the wrong way and in the wrong place, and they’re destroying our political world in the process.

That turns out not to be a very realistic concept. Yes, we can hold elections within parties, but party leaders will always have vastly more information about candidates — their strengths and flaws, their ability to govern and work with Congress, their backing among various interest groups and coalitions — than voters and caucusgoers do. That information is useful, even vital, to the task of picking a good nominee. As the political scientist E. E. Schattschneider once said, democracy is to be found between the parties, not within them.

Casting doubts about a party’s legitimacy — in particular picking a presidential nominee — can have real electoral consequences.

By the spring of 2016, democratic legitimacy was the overwhelming rationale of his campaign. In the general election, roughly one Sanders supporter in 10 ended up voting for Donald Trump, and many young voters defected for third-party candidates, possibly costing Mrs. Clinton the election in several key states.

This also happened in 1924, when Democrats held a famously divisive convention that spanned two weeks and 103 ballots. William Gibbs McAdoo of California fought to a nomination stalemate against Gov. Al Smith of New York, a favorite of the Tammany Hall organization.

McAdoo ran a deeply populist campaign aimed at maximizing his apparent democratic legitimacy. He ran in over a dozen primaries, a very rare approach at that time. He held numerous rallies among his supporters and claimed their mandate for leadership, all the while warning about the “sinister forces” trying to undermine his nomination.

During the convention, after the 77th ballot, he gave a rousing speech to his delegates, claiming, “I feel that I have to carry out the mandate of the people,” arguing that his candidacy symbolized democracy itself. Remarkably, in a contest between a Catholic New Yorker (Smith) and a Klan sympathizer (McAdoo), internal party democracy had become the defining issue of the campaign.

But this argument, however dramatic, wasn’t enough for McAdoo to win nomination. Unable to secure the necessary two-thirds of delegates, he and Smith eventually bowed out and made way for John W. Davis of West Virginia. Democrats divided, and they lost in a rout to Calvin Coolidge that fall.

Today, Democrats are undergoing some deep — and valid — soul-searching. The unity commission came with no shortage of internal division.

But it’s what happens when a party insists on being too democratic and when candidates use democratic appeals as a cudgel to undermine their opponents. Yes, Democrats did well in recent elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere, but those victories papered over very serious rifts that could affect it during the next presidential election cycle.

Tensions between party factions don’t have to result in lasting hostilities. As a candidate in 2004, Howard Dean made similar claims to grass-roots support and a bid financed by small donors. But Mr. Dean exited the nomination contest early on, endorsing the presumptive nominee John Kerry by the end of March.

Parties have something of a dual purpose — they need to win elections but also find a way to channel the different voices within their coalitions. Sometimes those goals mesh well and at other times they’re in tension.

The belief that parties should be internally democratic, which has gained wider acceptance over time and, with the reform commission, is likely accelerating, has altered the way parties balance those two objectives. Candidates who lose the nomination can protest on democratic grounds and gain traction in doing so.

But there’s a real danger in taking this path. It undermines both the nominee and the party, both immediately and in the long run. And it undermines one of the necessary, if difficult, aspects of democracy: conceding gracefully when you lose.",Is the Democratic Party Becoming Too Democratic?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/opinion/democratic-party.html

Research had linked birth control pills to a modest increase in breast cancer decades ago.

Both nonhormonal IUDs like the Paragard (or copper IUD) and hormone-releasing IUDs provide long-term, reversible contraception, Dr. Manson said.","Oral contraceptives appear to reduce the incidence of some less common reproductive cancers, like endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, which is often detected at an advanced stage, when it is hard to treat. There is some evidence that birth control pills may also reduce the odds of colorectal cancer.

A British study of over 46,000 women who were recruited in 1968, during the early days of the pill, and followed for up to 44 years found that despite increases in breast and cervical cancers among those who used the pill, the effect on overall cancer rates was neutral, because other cancers were reduced.

Other studies have reached the same conclusion.

“In aggregate, over a woman’s lifetime contraceptive use might prevent more cancers” than it causes, said David J. Hunter, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at University of Oxford in Britain, who wrote a commentary on the Danish study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week.

“There is good data to show that five or more years of oral contraceptive use substantially reduces ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer risk, and may reduce colorectal cancer,” he said. “And the protection persists for 10 or 20 years after cessation.”

While the new study’s findings about breast cancer are important, “these results are not a cause for alarm,” said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, a professor of women’s health at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

“It’s really problematic to look at one outcome in isolation. Hormonal contraception has a complex matrix of benefits and risks, and you need to look at the overall pattern.”

Dr. Hal Lawrence, an obstetrician-gynecologist and chief executive officer of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said his biggest concern was that the study would “scare women away from effective contraception,” resulting in unwanted pregnancies.

“We’re never going to eliminate all the potential risks that come with medication,” Dr. Lawrence said. “But we know a lot of the benefits, and the No. 1 benefit is preventing unintended pregnancies and the health and socio-economic risks that go along with that.”

In some ways, the results of the new study were not surprising. Research had linked birth control pills to a modest increase in breast cancer decades ago.

What was surprising was that the risk has persisted even with new pills that use lower doses of estrogen than the first generation of pills that came on the market — and that the increase in risk was experienced even by women who don’t take hormones orally, relying instead on implanted intrauterine devices that release a hormone “locally” into the uterus.

Many older women who have completed their families and are at higher risk for breast cancer because of their age turn to the IUD precisely because they want to minimize exposure to hormones.

So what are women to do?

Here’s some advice from top doctors who were interviewed about the implications of the new research.

• First, if you’re concerned, make an appointment to speak with your health care provider. Think about your priorities and preferences, the stage of life you’re in, your family plans and medical history, and find a doctor who will take time to listen to your concerns.

“Providers do tend to think a preference for a nonhormonal method is inherently unscientific, and we tend to dismiss that preference as not being founded in fact, and we have to recognize that women have real personal reasons for their preferences,” said Dr. Christine Dehlendorf, director of the program in woman-centered contraception in the department of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

“We have to trust women to know what their preferences are, and what their abilities are to use certain methods, and to choose the methods that are the best choice for them.”

• If you’re using oral contraceptives for reasons other than birth control, such as irregular periods, premenstrual syndrome or acne, consider taking a break from pills, suggested Dr. Marisa Weiss, an oncologist who founded breastcancer.org. The condition may have improved since you started taking the pills, or you may be able to find a nonhormonal way to manage it.

• If you use an IUD, find out if it releases the hormone progestin, which the Danish study implicated in the increased breast cancer risk. Both nonhormonal IUDs like the Paragard (or copper IUD) and hormone-releasing IUDs provide long-term, reversible contraception, Dr. Manson said. (Because an IUD can be effective for several years, it’s easy to forget about it; some women may not recall which kind they have.) Keep in mind that hormone-releasing IUDs may make menstrual periods lighter, while nonhormonal IUDs may make them heavier.

• If you’re not sexually active on a regular basis with a steady partner, or are using condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, ask your doctor if this might be a good time to take a break from the pill. One of the findings of the Danish study was that the risks increased with longer duration of hormone use.

• Ask your provider about new contraceptive products or older methods that have fallen out of favor but might be a good fit for you. The new diaphragm Caya, for example, does not have to be fitted and can be purchased at the drugstore with a doctor’s prescription. Apps can guide you through fertility-awareness methods that rely on daily tracking of body temperature and cervical mucous (these methods require motivation and discipline). Be aware that many doctors say these methods are less reliable than hormonal contraception; IUDs and sterilization are the most effective at preventing pregnancy.

• As you approach 40, you may want to discuss nonhormonal methods of contraception with your health provider. The risk of breast cancer increases with age, as does the risk of complications associated with oral contraceptives, such as blood clots in the legs and the lungs.

Most gynecologists do not think women under 35 or 40 need to worry about the findings of the new study. “The risk seen in this study is an incredibly small risk,” said Dr. Melissa Gilliam, a pediatric and adolescent gynecologist at the University of Chicago.

“This is not a call to change contraceptive behavior. An adolescent who uses birth control pills for painful periods when she’s 14 should not be hearing she has an increased risk of breast cancer.”

• If you have already had children and your family is complete, consider surgical options — for women and men. “We should be talking about vasectomy more,” Dr. Manson said. “It should be seriously considered in many relationships.”

Among married couples where the woman has taken responsibility for contraception for most of the relationship, this can be a way to share the burden.

And if your goal is to reduce your overall risk of breast cancer, know that having children before age 30, breast-feeding at any age for any length of time, minimizing exposure to radiation, and not using hormone therapy after menopause — all can help reduce risk.

Lifestyle changes — including not smoking, losing weight, exercising at least three to four hours a week, limiting red meat, and drinking no more than three alcoholic drinks a week — may reduce your risk, Dr. Weiss said.

On Oct. 30, four weeks after Ms. Doe filed a lawsuit accusing Dr. Harris of kissing and groping her in 2014, Columbia announced that Dr. Harris, 79, would step down from teaching and other student-related duties. He remains an employee of the university.

Dr. Harris did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for Columbia said administrators were dedicated to making the school harassment-free. “Universities do not exist apart from the widespread re-examination of workplace conduct that has dominated so much of the nation’s attention in recent weeks,” she said in a statement.

Dr. Moss and Dr. Knust are the first women to publicly accuse Dr. Harris and allow their names to be used. They said they decided to come forward after seeing Ms. Doe’s lawsuit. They, along with four other women who declined to be identified, have signed on as witnesses in support of Ms. Doe’s claim that the university turned a blind eye to Dr. Harris’s longstanding pattern of harassment, according to David Sanford, Ms. Doe’s lawyer.

Dr. Moss, now an associate professor at Wayne State University in Michigan, said she never expected Columbia to take action when she was a student.

Dr. Harris’s interest in her developed slowly, she said. During her second year of graduate study, in 1985, he began inviting her to dinner after seminars.

At the dinners, the topics of conversation moved from Roman history to sex in general to her personal life, she said. Dr. Harris never explicitly propositioned her. But she said “there was a constant sexual thing hanging over all of these interactions.”

She did not voice her discomfort outright to him, let alone to any other professors. “He was a very, very important person in the field, and I knew I wasn’t going to get anywhere without his support,” she said.

Her only recourse, she said, was gradually to stop going to dinner with Dr. Harris, and also to begin working more closely with another professor, Roger Bagnall.

Jacqueline Long, another student in the department at the time who is now a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, said she recalled Dr. Moss telling her about her discomfort with Dr. Harris. “She was getting hives and all sorts of allergic stress reactions,” Dr. Long said.

In the fall of 1986, Dr. Moss said, she sat for a Greek language exam, the last exam she needed to qualify for official status as a Ph.D. candidate. Dr. Harris administered the test, then told her she had failed.

Dr. Bagnall intervened and asked to see the test, but Dr. Harris refused.

Now an emeritus professor at New York University, Dr. Bagnall said Dr. Harris’s refusal was unprecedented, as the standard practice for disputed exams was to bring in a second reader.

Eventually Dr. Harris agreed to let Dr. Bagnall see the exam. Dr. Bagnall said that she had passed. So did a third reader, who served as a tiebreaker.

Dr. Bagnall said he was aware of Dr. Harris’s reputation for pursuing and harassing young women.

But he acknowledged that university policies surrounding such behavior had not yet crystallized. He did not report the dispute over the exam to administrators.

Dr. Moss said she would not have expected him or other professors to do so. “I just don’t think at the time there was anything, if they had gone to a dean or provost, that would have happened,” she said.

But even by the standards of the day, Dr. Bagnall said, Dr. Harris’s actions were clearly out of line.

“I think anybody would recognize that there’s a duty of care” between professors and students, Dr. Bagnall said. “And certainly in any situation where you use power against the interests of the student, even in the mid-80s, that just wasn’t acceptable.”

When Dr. Knust, now a tenured professor at Boston University, entered Columbia in the fall of 1993, a university committee had recently published draft guidelines stating that while Columbia was not barring romantic relationships between faculty and students, it was “always the faculty member’s responsibility to interpret with the greatest sensitivity the signals, negative or positive, received from the student and to refrain from exerting any pressure on that student,” according to a Nov. 3, 1993 article in the Columbia Spectator.

“Not taking ‘no’ for an answer may well constitute sexual harassment,” the draft said.

But administrators at the time said they doubted the draft would ever become policy. There was a “disposition not to write out this kind of thing into codes and rules,” Elinor Barber, an assistant provost at the time, told the student paper.

As that policy debate unfolded, Dr. Knust was experiencing a replay of what Dr. Moss said she had experienced a decade earlier: invitations to office hours and cocktail receptions, which turned into private meals.

At a lunch in 1995, Dr. Harris made his affections explicit, inviting Dr. Knust, who was married, to engage in a romantic relationship, she said.

Like Dr. Moss, Dr. Knust said she felt unable to be forthright in her rejection. She laughed off his advances instead, bringing up her husband and children more often in conversation.

“I played the game I learned in seventh grade when a boy likes you,” she said. “You make up some reason so that you protect their feelings, so that they don’t get angry with you, and you still manage to escape. It’s a skill a 12-year-old girl learns that she needs for the rest of her life.”

Dr. Knust said she never felt that Dr. Harris retaliated against her.

She said she told a fellow graduate student about Dr. Harris’s proposition at the time, and a professor several years later. Both confirmed her account.

By the time Ms. Doe began studying with Dr. Harris in 2014, Columbia had codified its stance on faculty-student relationships. “No faculty member shall have a consensual romantic or sexual relationship with a student over whom he or she exercises academic authority,” reads a policy approved by the faculty senate in 2012.

But Ms. Doe said the university paid only lip service to that policy. After she complained about Dr. Harris’s behavior, administrators asked her to avoid him, rather than restricting him from their shared buildings on campus, her lawsuit says; and professors dismissed her concerns, even though they said they were not surprised by them, she said.

Ms. Doe filed her lawsuit just three days before The New York Times published its first article on the allegations against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein.

In the months since, as the country has reckoned with revelations of harassment and assault in entertainment, media and politics, the world of academia has emerged as something of a paradox.

Mr. Sanford said he had seen an uptick in calls from people who said they had been harassed.

But Gayatri Phadke, a graduate student at the University of Connecticut and member of the graduate student union who has worked to negotiate the school’s sexual harassment policies, said students are by definition less likely to feel empowered to speak out against harassment. They are just beginning their careers, dependent upon their professors not only for connections and recommendations but also for their very degrees.

And while universities have often been at the forefront of conversations about gender equity and consent, “Whether you finish your Ph.D. or not is highly dependent on the individuals who are on your committee,” Ms. Phadke said. “And if one of them is the abuser, there’s very little chance that you can successfully stay in graduate school while outing that person.”","At Columbia, Three Women, 30 Years and a Pattern of Harassment",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/nyregion/columbia-university-sexual-harassment-three-decades.html

The New Health Care People Don’t Take Their Pills. Only One Thing Seems to Help. High-tech approaches and “reminder” packaging don’t work well. Reducing prices does.

For all that Americans spend on prescription drugs — $425 billion last year — you’d think we’d actually take our medicine.

But one of the frustrating truths about American health care is that half or more of prescribed medication is never taken.

It’s called medication nonadherence, and it’s a well-documented and longstanding problem, particularly for patients with chronic conditions. The drugs they’re prescribed are intended to prevent costly complications, reduce hospitalization, even keep them alive. But even when the stakes are high, many patients don’t take their meds.

This seems like a problem we ought to be able to solve. It motivates high tech approaches, like digital pills that can automatically communicate to doctors that they’ve been taken.

Maybe people forget to take their meds — about 60 percent of people say as much — so we just need to remind them. Maybe people don’t understand the value of what they’re prescribed, so we just need to educate them. Maybe drug regimens are too complex, so we just need to simplify dosing.

All these methods have been tried. It’s not so clear any of them work very well.

Only one approach has repeatedly been shown to be effective: reducing the cost of medications.

First, let’s look at the research on the other methods. So-called reminder packaging — pill packaging or containers that organize drugs by single dose or day of the week — is a relatively simple idea intended to help people remember to take their prescribed dose.

A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that it was helpful in doing so, but only modestly. Surveying 12 randomized controlled trials, the authors concluded that reminder packaging increased the number of pills taken by patients by 11 percentage points. But they also found that most of the studies had significant methodological flaws, casting doubt on the findings. Other systematic reviews of reminder packaging studies also found problems with the research, like small sample sizes and short follow-up periods.

Perhaps reminder packaging is too passive, and patients need something like an alarm to alert them when they’ve missed a dose. Electronic pill monitors can do that. Some just remind patients to take their medication. More sophisticated ones alert doctors when they don’t. In 2014, a team of researchers from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School published a systematic review of such devices in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Here, too, the results are disappointing. Most studies of such devices do not detect improvement in adherence.

A recent randomized trial not included in these systematic reviews tested three dose reminder approaches for people with a chronic health condition or depression: a pill bottle with toggles for each day of the week that can be changed after each daily dose; a pill bottle cap with a digital timer displaying the time elapsed since the medication was last taken; and a pill organizer with a compartment for every day of the week. Over 50,000 subjects were assigned randomly to one of these approaches or to none, as a control.

None of the devices performed better than the control in getting patients to take their medications. One possible explanation is that forgetfulness may not be why patients don’t take their medications as prescribed. Drug costs, a wish to avoid side effects, and a desire to be less reliant on drugs are some of the other reasons patients don’t take them.

“It is also possible that for reminder devices to be effective, they need to be coupled with other adherence-improvement strategies,” said Niteesh Choudhry, lead author of the study and a physician with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

That’s why augmenting electronic monitoring with other information or assistance delivered to patients may be more successful, if more expensive. For example, one study found that the adherence of hypertensive patients increased when digital display containers were combined with a blood pressure cuff and a card for recording blood pressure. This suggests that when patients receive feedback that signals how well they are controlling their condition, they may be more willing to take their medication.

Still, it isn’t hard to find studies that show that even with considerable support, getting patients to take medications can be challenging. A Cochrane review examined randomized controlled trials of interventions — across many dimensions — to increase medication adherence. Reminder packaging and alarms were just some of the methods assessed, with approaches including patient and family education about the value of medication, and mail or telephone follow-up.

Of the 182 randomized trials reviewed, four stood out as the most methodologically sound. Among those, two increased adherence but two did not. Over all, the authors concluded that there was a lack of convincing evidence that even complex and costly interventions significantly increased patients’ compliance with drug regimens.

“A cure for nonadherence is nowhere to be seen,” they wrote. A more recent study not included in the Cochrane review found that not even providing patients with financial incentives and social support, along with pill bottles that signal when a dose should be taken, was enough to boost adherence among heart attack survivors.

So why is price so important?

When drugs cost them less, patients are more likely to fill prescriptions. Even if people have already purchased drugs, they may skip doses — or split the pills — because of concerns that they won’t be able to afford future refills. Free drugs don’t get everyone to take them, but many more do so than if they have to pay for them.

For those with certain chronic conditions, extra help in affording medications can reduce adverse events and hospitalizations — a big increase in quality of life, as well as a potential benefit to the wider health care system and the economy.

Lowering prescription drug costs has been a longstanding pursuit for many politicians, and Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act helped (although most Americans still say costs are too high). President Trump said drug companies “have been getting away with murder,” but lower drug costs have not yet been a top priority of this White House.

“Our outcomes are nowhere near where we want them to be as far as on-time graduation and achieving competencies,” said William G. Clark, president of the Urban League of Rochester, which is part of the coalition that released the report. “And our homeless and formerly homeless students are only at half of that.”

The Education Trust found that there are schools where homeless students did better than statewide averages — there were 169 schools where this was the case in math and 164 in reading. A vast majority of those schools were in New York City, and about a third of them were charter schools.

“When we see these very successful schools that have reached homeless students, it really is a bright spot,” said Anna Shaw-Amoah, principal policy analyst at the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness. “It’s a point we need to be making, that these low proficiency scores we’re seeing over all really can rise up. It doesn’t need to be that way.”

Abja Midha, the deputy director of the Education Trust-New York, visited a few of the schools where homeless students performed well. She said that while each approach was tailored to that school’s particular community, they all used targeted academic help and intensive engagement with the families, and tried to address the social and emotional needs of their homeless students.

The study was written with an eye toward a federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was signed by President Obama in 2015. Under that law, states are required to report on the academic outcomes, like state test scores and high school graduation rates, for students in temporary housing. The coalition that released the study, which advocates on how best to implement the new education law in New York, includes civil rights, education and business organizations from around the state.

“Our coalition believes that the reason E.S.S.A. is so important is that it provides an opportunity to shine a light on how well schools are doing for every group of students,"" said Mr. Rosenblum of the Education Trust. “As we think about what groups of students are particularly vulnerable, it’s clear that the education system needs to do a better job of serving students in temporary housing and formerly homeless students.”","No Longer Homeless, but Still Struggling in School",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/homeless-students-school-new-york.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

We were led into a small locker room, where we took off all our clothes except for underwear and put on disposable bandeau-style bras — no underwires allowed in the cryo chamber because the metal can freeze and burn the skin — white cotton athletic socks, white cotton gloves an archivist might wear, a white robe, disposable surgical masks to protect our mouths and noses, ear warmers, black rubber sandals and giant wool mittens.

After about a minute, the cold seemed to move into my body. Chatting to pass the time was not an option. Moving around was difficult. We started moaning in pain as Yvonne counted off the last 30 seconds.

Karyn and I ran outside, where we put our robes back on and stood on vibrating plates for a few minutes, which was supposed to help our now-red bodies warm up. Then the staff brought us hot tea, and we sat down.

That’s when we both started feeling strangely hyper and euphoric. “I feel like I had three espressos and could run six miles,” I said.

Karyn said, “I’m going to tell the sober people in my life to try this.” We babbled about clothes and movies. A regular client emerged from the chamber and onto the vibrating plates. “I would do this every day if I could,” he said.

Maybe I would. The strain in my muscle wasn’t completely gone, but it felt noticeably better all day. Supposedly you sleep well the night after, but neither of us did. I was still so wired that I spent half the night listening to Tina Brown read “The Vanity Fair Diaries” audiobook and thinking about how Ms. Brown managed to get so much done every day.

In another passage, right after winning, the authors described Mr. Trump marveling that he got into the race essentially to have some fun.","But the authors are also the first Trump aides to put their names to stories about the campaign’s internal dynamics and to describe some notorious habits of Mr. Trump’s, like his preferences for lunch: He really did eat a lunch of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate shake, which he would call a “malted.”

“Do you think I deserve a malted today? I think I deserve one,” Mr. Trump would say after a hard-charging day of appearances.

He flipped incessantly through cable news, monitoring his coverage. The snacks aboard his private plane included Oreos and chips. He ordered people who sneezed to sit away from him. He ordered people Diet Cokes regardless of whether they actually wanted them, because that is what he drinks.

He spoke in non sequiturs that did not always make sense to the people on the other end of the conversation.

“Corey sat there with a half-smile on his face, not knowing quite how to respond,” the authors wrote about Mr. Lewandowski’s first job interview with Mr. Trump, as the candidate ticked off his fleet of planes and helicopters.

“Corey would come to find in the months and years that followed that Donald Trump’s mind works differently than most,” they wrote. “His thoughts sometimes come out like pieces of a puzzle. It’s only later when you put the pieces together that you realize how much they’re worth.”

Early on, according to the authors, who stitched together their own experiences and glossed over the times when neither was on the campaign, Mr. Trump got key validation from his wife, Melania, for an attack on Senator John McCain — whom he suggested was a war hero simply for being captured — because Mr. Trump said he had not helped veterans enough.

And he could be brutal to his underlings.

“The mode that he switches to when things aren’t going his way can feel like an all-out assault,” Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Bossie wrote about Mr. Trump’s notorious outbursts. Those moments pass quickly, they wrote, but can be disorienting. “Being the target of his wrath can make for a pretty jarring experience.”

When Reince Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Mr. Trump the same weekend the “Access Hollywood” tape was made public by The Washington Post that he needed to consider dropping out of the race, Mr. Trump replied, “If the Republican Party is going to run away from me, then I will take you all down with me.”

Two longer-serving aides with whom Mr. Lewandowski feuded, Roger J. Stone Jr. and Sam Nunberg, are marginalized.

While many have given Mr. Stone, Mr. Trump’s longest-serving adviser, the credit for bringing women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second debate, a stunt that clearly rattled Hillary Clinton, the authors attributed the idea to Stephen K. Bannon, who was by then the campaign chief executive.

Other former colleagues came in for warmer treatment, particularly Mr. Bannon, who is described as helping correct a ship that Mr. Manafort had driven toward trouble.

Kellyanne Conway was shown repeatedly trying to make Mr. Trump understand how his words could be offensive to women, particularly talking about the weight of Alicia Machado, the Miss Universe pageant entrant who became a flash point at the end of the campaign.

Then there are aspects of Mr. Trump that will sound wholly unfamiliar to most people who have worked with him. In one passage, the authors wrote that Mr. Trump — whose advisers always privately say he does not read books — loves “Memory, Dreams, Reflections,” by Carl Jung, the Swiss psychoanalyst.

And then there are things that Mr. Trump said that he has tried to paper over with the passage of time.

Neither anecdote is consistent with Mr. Trump’s insistence that he always knew he was going to win. But the authors observed that the former casino owner makes his own rules, and plays by them.

Stories often dwell on the gentrifying neighborhood’s property sales or the latest murder in the 40th precinct.

With coverage like that, it’s easy to forget that people live, love and grow up there.

In “Haven,” the photographer Sarah Blesener looks beyond the headlines, capturing a group of neighborhood boys coming of age. Her images defy the one-dimensional stereotype of “young boys in the Bronx.” No gang signs or bandanas, no flashing of guns, no clutched Hennessy bottles or blunts. Just kids.

Kids who cram into their mothers’ couches and text, who sit on each other’s beds like it’s their own, who spot each other a few quarters for chips and soda, who get nervous talking to their crush. They live in housing projects within walking distance of each other. Members of their family have been incarcerated, and they live in fear of being arrested themselves, as well as being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Their demeanors balance maturity and boyishness in a way those who live outside their neighborhood don’t necessarily get.

Ms. Blesener was born and raised in Minnesota and has only spent a few years in New York. One day, she was shooting a portrait of Chavi, 14, the first boy in the group she met through a friend at ICP, where she is a student. Chavi dreams of being a bachata star like another Bronx kid done good, Romeo Santos. After releasing a new single and asking Ms. Blesener for a portrait, she suggested they go up to a rooftop to get a panorama of the Bronx. Chavi was nervous, and after a few shots, asked to go back downstairs. Ms. Blesener didn’t understand why. He spelled it out for her: She can afford to get into trouble, he told her, but he can’t. “It really sucks that he has to be so aware of that at such a young age,” she said.

There are other things Chavi and his boys are aware of, too, like their neighborhood changing almost daily with expensive apartments, new cafes, restaurants and galleries. “They are all afraid of being left behind,” said Ms. Blesener, who recounted how she’d often make the walk with them down Third Avenue, and they’d stop and point out signs of gentrification: new businesses, shuttered ones, unfamiliar faces. In one photograph, they play softball in a field not far from Yankee Stadium. Behind them, a new construction project looms.

When Ms. Blesener met Chavi and his four friends as freshmen in high school, they were so shy they’d barely swear around her. Then she spent time with them, met their families and their girlfriends and they opened up. They are juniors now, experiencing their first breakups, their voices changing, and the feeling of being too cool to talk to anyone as openly as they once did.

Ms. Blesener said she plans to continue to photograph the boys until they are seniors in high school. The culmination, she hopes, will paint a different image of what it means to grow up in a neighborhood like Mott Haven.

“There’s nothing but bad statements about the place, especially when it comes to teenagers,” she said. “But these kids are really set on defying that. They don’t want to be put in those types of boxes.”

Although Drake’s Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school’s requested time, the dean still spoke.
“They basically put in writing: ‘We’re not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,’ ” Rossley says.
While advocates may refute Ehrhart’s suggestion that Title IX is now a state issue — unless Title IX and the Clery Act are overturned, state laws conflicting with them will be challenged in court — they concede that they can’t stop emboldened conservative legislatures from trying.
And that’s no accident, say advocates, many of whom have long warned that an attack on Title IX could enable similar attacks on Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act clause that forbids racial discrimination in schools, on which Title IX was modeled.","A decade ago, Title IX was better known as the law that forbade schools to banish women’s sports teams to the parking lot while men got the fields. Schools were required to address campus sexual assault under both Title IX and the 1990 Clery Act — a federal law, named for a Lehigh University freshman raped and killed in her dorm room, that requires colleges to report all campus crimes — but schools were only rarely sanctioned under the act, and few students knew how to lodge Title IX complaints. Reporting to law enforcement offered little help: Federal statistics compiled by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network show that only 310 out of 1,000 rapes are reported to the police. Just 11 of those are referred for prosecution, and just seven lead to felony convictions. Even if the criminal-justice system pursued sexual-assault allegations more aggressively, college victims would still have to face the accused on campus as investigations and prosecutions drag on for months, or even years.

In 2011, following an investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity on campus assault, the Obama administration decided to act. The Office for Civil Rights sent a “dear colleague letter” reminding colleges that sexual harassment and assault create an environment so hostile that women’s access to education is jeopardized, violating their civil rights. The letter noted a commonly cited (though commonly challenged) statistic from the National Institute of Justice that one in five women are victims of attempted or actual sexual assault during college. A subsequent clarification of the letter created no uniform policy for how schools should adjudicate cases, but it offered recommendations like having schools inform students that drinking “never makes the survivor at fault for sexual violence” and discouraging colleges from allowing either party to directly cross-examine the other in investigations. Schools that failed to uphold standards risked losing federal funds.

Colleges responded by creating new Title IX offices and drafting individual policies that varied from school to school. Some universities use hearings; others employ a “single investigator” model, in which a school designee is responsible for both investigating and making a determination. More typical is something like this: After students disclose an assault to a “responsible employee,” that staff member must relay it to the Title IX officer, who determines whether a full investigation is warranted. If it is, the officer taps a staff member or external investigator who has been trained in Title IX procedures to contact the parties, interview witnesses and gather evidence. Complainants are asked to participate, but schools can proceed without them if they decide the claim poses a larger threat on campus. A report is produced that each party can comment on, and panel hearings are held. Until this September, Office for Civil Rights rules stipulated that all of this needed to happen within 60 days, and afterward, the parties could appeal.

Campus reporting of sexual misconduct spiked significantly, and that increase led to an outcry from conservative media, including writers for National Review and Town Hall, which argued that the guidance letter made accusations as good as a verdict. The day the Office for Civil Rights sent its letter, the federal government made “all sex unsafe on campus,” the libertarian magazine Reason said.

The most widespread criticism was that the letter forced schools to lower their standard of proof when assessing claims, to the “preponderance of evidence” standard commonly used in civil lawsuits. Unlike the higher standard used in some civil trials, which require “clear and convincing evidence,” or the highest standard used in criminal trials, which require certainty “beyond reasonable doubt,” preponderance is often described as 50.01 percent certainty of guilt. If an accused student is found more likely than not to have committed the offense, he or she is “responsible,” in the parlance of campus hearings. While there were exceptions before 2011 — schools that used “clear and convincing” or, in a few instances, “beyond reasonable doubt” — preponderance was used in about 80 percent of colleges that had any fixed standard.

Victims’ advocates argued that it followed an established legal principle: In civil cases, where criminal penalties aren’t on the line, the burden of proof is lower. But critics viewed the mandate to use preponderance as a means to finding more accused students responsible, and the standard became a sort of shorthand — that college men were no longer presumed innocent and were being expelled en masse over “regret sex.”

It was an oversimplification, but also one that reflected real problems in the process. To Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a nonpartisan nonprofit that works on free speech, religious liberty and due process in higher education, the larger issue is that the lower standard exists within a “parallel judicial system” that lacks other due-process protections — like the consistent right for attorneys to meaningfully participate in hearings and access to the legal procedures to investigate complex cases. Schools can’t subpoena witnesses to compel relevant testimony or put people under oath; they rarely have access to forensic evidence or processes for discovery.

“O.C.R.’s rationale” was that preponderance of evidence “was the standard for suits alleging civil rights violations like sexual harassment,” wrote Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge and current Harvard law professor, in The American Prospect in 2015. “True enough, except for the fact that civil trials at which this standard is implemented follow months if not years of discovery.” She continued: “It is the worst of both worlds, the lowest standard of proof coupled with the least protective procedures.”

In 2016, FIRE, which had been connecting accused students with lawyers and offering a class to attorneys on handling complaints, put out a recruitment call for plaintiffs to sue the Department of Education over the guidance letter. There was already an abundance of lawsuits against schools — at least 190, according to the men’s advocacy group Title IX for All. Typically, victims’ complaints about mishandled Title IX cases have gone to the Office for Civil Rights, while complaints from accused men land in civil court. In a ruling involving Brown University last year, a Rhode Island judge noted: “A student is not entitled to a perfect disciplinary process, and it is not the court’s role to be an appeals court for Brown’s disciplinary decisions.” At the time, no circuit courts had weighed in, but there were so many cases it seemed one would have to. This September, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did so, finding that the University of Cincinnati violated an accused student’s due-process rights by failing to let him cross-examine his accuser.

With funding from right-wing donors like the Charles Koch Institute, FIRE has often aligned with conservative sensibilities. But a number of academics and lawyers, among them a group of feminist Harvard law professors (including Gertner) who released a public letter in August calling for reform, have cited reasons Title IX policies should concern progressives, too: that overly broad definitions of misconduct, encompassing most drunken encounters, threaten to erode distinctions between consensual and nonconsensual sex; that anecdotal evidence (there’s little hard data available) suggests men of color are disproportionately punished; that a conservative administration could co-opt the campus-rape debate to further its own aims; or that perceptions of bias could trigger a backlash casting women as liars.

“I concede I’ve seen cases where it seems schools were taking shortcuts to justice,” says S. Daniel Carter, a longtime campus-safety expert who consults with colleges and universities about sexual misconduct. But schools that did so, he emphasizes, were violating policy or breaking the law. He points to a September 2017 study released by FIRE that found that most top schools fail to consistently ensure 10 safeguards it considers “fundamental elements of due process” — like providing adequate written notice of allegations and the need for impartial fact-finders. With the exception of two items on FIRE’s list — one calling for a presumption of innocence, which Carter believes violates Title IX’s requirement that adjudicators make no presumptions whatsoever — Carter says not only that he agrees with every principle but also that each is already required by Title IX, the Clery Act or the guidance letter.

In the case of Thomas Rossley, which Andrew Miltenberg joined when father and son decided to sue, the Rossleys contend that Drake violated some of these policies. The school’s acting dean was afforded equivalent speaking time as Thomas and his accuser — effectively doubling the amount of time allowed to make the case against Thomas, which the Rossleys argue is a violation of Office for Civil Rights guidelines. Although Drake’s Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school’s requested time, the dean still spoke. “They basically put in writing: ‘We’re not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,’ ” Rossley says. (In a court filing, Drake denies violating any rules or procedures.)

Victims’ advocates say that cases like this illustrate that the problem isn’t the policy but rather schools’ failing to follow it. A situation where a school gave more time to one party than the other, says Alexandra Brodsky, a fellow at the National Women’s Law Center, would be “both a clear error by the school and points to a need for a more nuanced conversation about Title IX enforcement than ‘Is Title IX good or bad?’ ”

“For my entire career, I’ve seen the pendulum swing,” Carter says. For decades, schools followed “the path of least resistance,” he says, to the detriment of victims. More recently, some followed the same path to the disadvantage of the accused. Now that pattern of reaction and counterreaction is happening at the national level. “It’s not back and forth so much as it’s the same old failed system,” Carter says. “Who is it failing the most today?”

“It’s becoming, I don’t know if ‘circus’ is the right word,” says Laura L. Dunn, the executive director of the national victims’ rights group SurvJustice, but “it’s so legally complex that it’s not an easy thing to step into.” School officials are being named in individual lawsuits, so fewer agree to serve on Title IX panels; self-identified victims increasingly need lawyers of their own, because they risk being sued. Advocates on both sides suspect that schools are hedging their bets as they adjudicate, fearing both lawsuits and Office for Civil Rights sanctions.

In the past six months, two different professional attorneys’ associations have reviewed campus sexual-misconduct policy, and a third’s assessment is underway. They’ve come to different conclusions — one proposing higher standards of proof, another access to all evidence for accused students. The American Bar Association task force’s recommendations led to disputes even within the A.B.A. “I don’t think either side of this issue has advocates that are completely imagining problems,” says Cohn, who admits that no proposed solutions — including FIRE’s — come without costs to either side. “There isn’t a perfect, utopian answer to the problem.”

But under the Trump administration, these complexities are being cast largely as a matter of overregulation. Secretary DeVos, who has argued that local authorities and parents should have greater control over education than the federal government, seems to have taken a similar approach with Title IX. When she had one of her first official conversations about Title IX last April, it wasn’t with national experts on either side, but rather with a combative Republican state representative, Earl Ehrhart of Georgia, who has argued that Title IX enables rampant false allegations and that schools have no business investigating sexual assault. Ehrhart came away from his meeting gratified that DeVos seemed to agree with him on the limited role federal authorities should play. “She’s placing this back where it belongs,” he told me, “in the purview of the states.”

In January 2016, Representative Ehrhart, a former chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which drafts model bills for conservative state legislators, decided, after hearing from the distraught mother of an accused student, to make Georgia the testing ground for challenging the “dear colleague letter.” A conservative with a penchant for bomb-throwing who has been lampooned by a Georgia reporter for delivering “Wagnerian” pronouncements, he began with what he called his “Georgia Tech hearing.” At the time, Georgia Tech had a mandatory-expulsion policy for students found responsible for rape, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that it had expelled or suspended more students for sexual misconduct than any other Georgia state school. It also then used the controversial single-investigator model. Ehrhart, as chairman of Georgia’s House Subcommittee on Appropriations for Higher Education, wielded his financial authority like a weapon, effectively denying Georgia Tech funds to expand its libraries and warning other colleges to be more concerned about losing his support than that of the Office for Civil Rights. “If you don’t protect the students of this state with due process,” he said, “don’t come looking for money — period.” Some victims’ advocates believe he leveraged his role again in pushing the state’s Board of Regents to overhaul its sexual-misconduct procedures. The board announced new rules, including banning the single-investigator model, which went into effect in mid-2016.

That April, Ehrhart and his wife, represented by Miltenberg, sued the Department of Education, challenging the dear colleague letter on the claim that Ehrhart’s stepson, a Georgia Tech student, could “be wrongly accused and found responsible.” Then, early this year, Ehrhart proposed a bill, H.B. 51, which initially mandated that any campus sexual-assault report be forwarded to the police, with or without the complainant’s consent, and forbade schools to take final disciplinary action for any possible felony until there was a conviction or a no-contest plea.

The complexity around campus sexual misconduct has led observers from diverse political backgrounds to call for turning the whole matter over to the police. In a forthcoming law-review article, Brodsky notes that since 2013, at least six states and Congress have considered bills that included some form of law-enforcement reporting. Some mandated that schools refer complaints regardless of victims’ wishes; Congress considered a bill that prevented colleges from proceeding with Title IX processes until the police were at least notified, or in some cases, until a conviction was obtained. But no state bill before H.B. 51 took such an extreme approach — or so flagrantly contradicted federal law. And because state bills cannot override federal law, H.B. 51 seemed intended to force a court challenge to the dear colleague letter.

That, Ehrhart acknowledged, was the point. When we met in Atlanta in March, over Chick-fil-A sandwiches, he said he hoped “Georgia will hang a light on the problem such that the O.C.R., the D.O.E., will be put in a position: ‘Here’s a state statutory enactment that’s 180 degrees different from the old guidance letters. What are we going to do?’ ” Given the Trump administration’s signaling its distance from the dear colleague letter, he wagered that if H.B. 51 passed, the new Office for Civil Rights wouldn’t withdraw federal funds. Then other states would see that they could challenge the letter without repercussion and would follow suit.

The H.B. 51 fight was ugly. Hundreds of student protesters went to the state’s Capitol, where legislators challenged women seeking to testify about their assaults during a preliminary hearing. Ehrhart reprimanded one group of victims, saying: “If you feel triggered, trigger somewhere else.” Men’s rights activists showed up to lobby, at times targeting individual activists. They speculated on social media that one student organizer was a “pretty little liar” and brought to the Capitol a man suspended for having assaulted another.

The backlash Ehrhart mobilized created collateral casualties of its own. In his Georgia Tech hearing, Ehrhart read aloud a letter from the mother of a man expelled after being found responsible for rape. The expelled man had sued, and while his accuser wasn’t a defendant, her name and identifying details were in court documents then available to the public. It was a threat that her attorney, Lisa Anderson, who represents victims pro bono as executive director of Atlanta Women for Equality, feared was a new tactic: essentially outing women who lodged Title IX complaints.

There were threads about her case on the school’s Reddit page; riding a bus across campus, she sat in stricken silence as two students discussed it and decided she had probably made it up. Sidelined by panic attacks, she withdrew from most classes by the end of the semester, and though she tried to return last fall, she ended up leaving again and was hospitalized for a week after becoming suicidal. Her G.P.A. slipped so low that she told me she fears that she can’t transfer elsewhere, and that her only chance to graduate is to wait for the current crop of Georgia Tech students to cycle out.

At Kennesaw State University, one woman found that as the Georgia debate around Title IX grew, her case was caught up in the furor. According to her complaint, early one morning in February 2016, she was raped by a male friend, when consensual fooling around ended in nonconsensual intercourse that she explicitly refused. At first, she told me, she thought her friend had merely “disrespected” her clear line. She let him spend the night, and in the morning they ate breakfast, making plans to meet later. The man didn’t call, and the woman, troubled, talked to friends, who told her she was describing rape. Her mother took her to the hospital and the police, and school officials were informed. K.S.U. started an investigation. (The man denied that they had intercourse.)

But over the summer, as the new Board of Regents policy went into effect, the woman claimed the tone shifted. In her last interview, she says, investigators asked whether she was calling the situation rape because the man hadn’t called. Nonetheless, they found him responsible and recommended a two-semester suspension. (The man’s attorney, Lisa Wells, said the K.S.U. office fell out of touch for nearly five months, leading her client to believe the matter had been dropped.)

In the lead-up to a planned hearing in October 2016, the man argued that the investigation had been biased and hadn’t adequately considered his evidence. He asked that his case be reheard under the new regents’ policy and requested a stay of his decision “until the enforceability of the 2011 dear colleague letter has been adjudicated” — suggesting that Ehrhart’s lawsuit might settle the point. The request for a stay was denied, but the school agreed to have an external reviewer assess the case. When they informed the woman, she received a list of new witnesses for the man’s defense; among them was Ehrhart.

“I had no clue who he was or what he could possibly know about somebody raping me,” she said. “As soon as Ehrhart’s name came up, everything went crazy, and they dropped any care they had for me.” As a representative of K.S.U.’s district, Ehrhart had substantial ties to the school. He co-owned a sprawling sports complex that partnered with the university, and when K.S.U. needed a new president in 2016, Ehrhart championed the appointment of the state’s conservative attorney general, Sam Olens, who served with Ehrhart on the board of a K.S.U. business accelerator.

In the fall of 2016, Lisa Anderson, who represents the woman in the K.S.U. case as well, began to notice that email records K.S.U. sent had redactions in the “cc” line — a third party being kept abreast of the case. After filing multiple records requests, Anderson found emails involving Ehrhart, Lisa Wells and Olens. In one, Ehrhart wrote to Olens: “This is the second of the absolutely ridiculous cases I was concerned about. I label this one ‘breakfast with a rapist’ made for TV absurdity.” He noted he was drafting new legislation to remove such “nonsense” cases from university jurisdiction and his belief that “with a new administration in D.C., the guidance letters are now garbage, and the threat of federal funding is off the table.” In closing, he appeared to request a specific outcome: “I also hope this case can be dealt with in an expeditious manner benefiting its absurdity.”

Olens forwarded the email to the K.S.U. Title IX coordinator. When an external reviewer’s report came back in early 2017 — around the same time Ehrhart introduced H.B. 51 — it reversed the initial decision. (Wells says Ehrhart’s emails could not have influenced the external reviewer’s findings because they weren’t forwarded to her. K.S.U. officials said they were unable to comment on a continuing matter.) When Anderson and the woman appealed in the spring and summer, a process that finally culminated in a hearing this October, the panel declared that both parties were equally credible, so it couldn’t find the man responsible. Even before the verdict, the woman had become so despondent that she decided to withdraw. Wells says her own client is suicidal.

Ehrhart’s bill ultimately failed to pass before the legislative session closed in March, staved off largely by the mobilization of student activists. But if he lost the battle, it would come to seem he had won the war. After DeVos rescinded the guidance letter, he was elated. “We’re back to pre-2011,” he told me. “In many ways, we’ve succeeded.”

“We in the advocacy community, who have been involved with Title IX for decades, understand this is nothing short of a catastrophe,” says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, which in 1977 was one of the first organizations to argue in court that sexual harassment violates Title IX. But the exact nature of that catastrophe is not yet clear. The language in the Office for Civil Rights’s rescission letter and interim guidance is vague enough to allow for different interpretations. It might forbid accusers to appeal. Ehrhart hopes for this but acknowledges that “they didn’t make it crystal clear.” A line criticizing the Obama administration’s failure to let schools rely on law enforcement might allow — or push — schools to relegate complaints to the police. The new Office for Civil Rights interim guidance allows schools to choose between the “preponderance” standard or the higher “clear and convincing,” which could open the floodgates to hundreds of students’ demanding their cases be reheard or bringing new lawsuits. DeVos’s comments have already been cited by a man suing the University of Vermont over his suspension for sexual harassment, noting in his lawsuit: “UVM’s procedures for adjudicating sexual-misconduct complaints is precisely the type of system referenced in DeVos’ statement.” (The university says it is “confident it has acted legally and appropriately.”)

Title IX practices may also start to diverge state to state. While advocates may refute Ehrhart’s suggestion that Title IX is now a state issue — unless Title IX and the Clery Act are overturned, state laws conflicting with them will be challenged in court — they concede that they can’t stop emboldened conservative legislatures from trying.

In the week after DeVos’s speech, a bill sped through California’s Legislature, codifying many of the procedural aspects of the 2011 guidance. Although Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill, citing concerns about due process, Farrell predicted it would be just one among numerous state initiatives. At an October meeting of the State Innovation Exchange, a progressive legislative advisory group, there was discussion of potential Title IX legislation in Colorado, Maryland and Massachusetts; in November, a Massachusetts bill mandating better sexual-assault training for campus staff unanimously passed the State Senate.

Attorneys general will also take on a more active role, says Lizzie Ulmer, a member of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, which sent DeVos an open letter in July urging her not to rescind the guidance and has since held meetings to discuss how states can serve as a stopgap against federal changes. Already, Attorney General Andy Beshear of Kentucky has used his office to sue three state universities for concealing records related to sexual harassment or abuse allegations. “The lawsuits that we’re filing are now more critical than ever,” Beshear says. “If the Education Department is not going to be actively monitoring these investigations by our universities under Title IX, it’s going to take other leaders on the state level.” This could create a situation in which protections for students, on either side of an accusation, vary enormously depending where they live. “One thing we have to think about is it really does become a state jigsaw,” Dunn says. “We have a very polarized political debate, and I think states will come out all over the map.”

Calling campus sexual misconduct a state issue is a short step from calling it an issue of states’ rights. And that’s no accident, say advocates, many of whom have long warned that an attack on Title IX could enable similar attacks on Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act clause that forbids racial discrimination in schools, on which Title IX was modeled. The case law around both is intertwined, Dunn says, and their fates are, too: “If you’re rolling back Title IX, the next thing you roll back is Title VI.”

It’s an argument that some conservatives are already making. Days after DeVos withdrew the guidance, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed suggesting that she shouldn’t stop there but should also withdraw a 2014 guidance concerning the disproportionate suspension and expulsion of black and Hispanic students. The same week, the Federalist Society released a report, written in part by individuals who had been active in criticizing Title IX practices, charging that the Obama Department of Education had overreached on three grounds: the guidance on campus sexual misconduct; a 2016 letter, also under Title IX, mandating transgender students’ access to facilities that correspond with their identity; and the 2014 guidance over disparate suspensions of black and Hispanic students. Given that the first two guidance letters were withdrawn by the time the report was published, the next target seemed clear. The conservative think tank Center for Equal Opportunity, two of whose staff members helped write the report, published a blog post with the headline “Two Down, One to Go.”

One advocate, who asked to remain anonymous to describe a closed-door meeting with the Office for Civil Rights, said that Title VI had come up in conversation with Candice Jackson. “We’ve tried to approach them in good faith,” the advocate said, “and I think they’ve used it to unfortunately learn more of what they could undo.” In October, DeVos rescinded 72 additional Department of Education policies related to the civil rights of students with disabilities, an effort, the department said, to eliminate outdated guidance. A few weeks later, department officials met with a group of educators and advocates calling for the rescission of the third Department of Education guidance letter, on disproportionate discipline of students of color. Among them was the lead author of the section of the Federalist Society report calling for the letter’s rescission. And just before Thanksgiving, the department proposed revising its procedures for investigating school civil rights violations to no longer assess whether an individual reported incident could reveal more systemic discrimination, according to a draft document obtained by The Associated Press.

“This is about ending civil rights protections,” Dunn told me. “This is removing what we had a Civil War over, which really was limiting the states in their ability to violate the rights of individuals. The federal government is meant to be a civil rights check, and states have always retained tons of power to fight that check, but they’re trying to erode even that.”

This November, Equal Rights Advocates held the first leadership meeting of the Initiative to End Sexual Violence in Education, a new national network of attorneys and activists to defend Title IX that will train hundreds of new lawyers, establish a hotline to gather complaints and file suit either against schools failing to uphold Title IX rights or on behalf of those who might come under attack from the new Office for Civil Rights. “If the O.C.R. won’t defend Title IX,” Farrell says, “we will.”

This spring, Miltenberg’s phone rang again. On the line was another mother. “You’re not going to take our case,” she said. “You’re for the other side.”

Her daughter, a freshman at a college in upstate New York, said she had been raped during her first semester, after she was separated from friends at a Halloween party and a man she’d never met grabbed and forcibly kissed her. She said he repeatedly asked her to go to his room, and she repeatedly refused. Later, when she was drunk, he offered to help her find her friends, but he said he needed to stop by his dorm first. Once in his room, she said, he immediately undressed. The woman doesn’t remember exactly what happened next, but she found herself naked on his bed. Then he raped her. When she got up to leave, she said, he told her, “Now go back to your room and don’t hook up with anyone else tonight.”

Weeks later, when the woman was out at a local bar, she felt someone staring at her and saw the man again, standing alone and watching her. Over the course of the night, as she moved from room to room to evade him, he followed, ultimately accosting her on the dance floor. (The accused man denies this account and maintains that the sex was consensual.)

By most campus standards, it seemed like a strong case. The woman had text messages she sent friends the night of the rape, saying she needed help; a female friend of the accused man would testify that she stopped by his room and saw the woman there, looking terrified. The same friend said the man asked her to tell campus authorities that everything looked fine. And the woman went to law enforcement.

After she filed a Title IX complaint last December, the woman and her family moved quickly to comply with the office’s requests, pulling together documentation in the weeks before Christmas and participating in a Skype interview on Dec. 18. But after the woman took a medical leave of absence — she struggled after the assault and was beginning therapy — the school’s commitment seemed to flag. By late January, the woman and her family say, officials hadn’t contacted any of the witnesses she suggested, and the accused student wasn’t interviewed until mid-February. The family decided they needed an attorney of their own. But they found lawyer after lawyer who represented only the accused; no one would take their case.

Miltenberg’s partner warned him that taking the case would be career suicide. But over the previous few months, he had started telling fellow Title IX critics that he didn’t think the dear colleague letter should be summarily withdrawn; perhaps it merely needed to be amended. Far from his earlier suggestion that women who don’t want to involve the police shouldn’t report to schools, he began to believe there was no easy way out of requiring colleges to take action. The police are too overburdened, he said, and some cops too “hard-boiled,” to respond to campus sexual assault well. Miltenberg’s new opinions made him unpopular. “I’m left out of a lot of email chains and phone calls now, and I used to be the lead guy,” he says.

He instructed the family to copy him on their communications with the school. The college’s own investigator was a woman Miltenberg says he contended with in the past, when she aggressively defended schools from lawsuits brought by men. The school allowed the male student to withdraw voluntarily on the eve of his hearing — informing the woman that meant the case was closed. “In any case I’ve ever done, the first thing parents ask is: ‘Can we just pull him out?’ ” Miltenberg says. Uniformly, in his experience, schools said no: The process would proceed, with or without the accused, and with findings of responsibility put on his permanent record. (The school says cases like this would result in a notation on the student’s transcript.) Miltenberg took the case.

When he met with the woman and her family in early June, he was shaken. “It was the first time I’ve ever sat with someone who’s a victim, at least in this type of setting,” he says. “I’m used to hearing the other side in detail and trying to come up with the parts that don’t add up, or where the story doesn’t make sense.” When the woman sent him a diary she kept in the months after the rape — a stream-of-consciousness account of the aftermath of losing control of her body — Miltenberg was aghast. As he read the diary, he imagined the voice of his eldest daughter, the same age as his client, and felt like throwing up. “I read this and think, My God, what if this is what every woman who feels they’ve been sexually assaulted feels like?”

As the woman’s lawsuits begin, she is starting her sophomore year at another university far from her first school. When she notified the New York college, she says, officials seemed almost overjoyed to approve her transfer.

When DeVos rescinded the letter in September, Miltenberg released a statement that did not betray any doubts but instead stated that he was “encouraged” by the action. But when he elaborated to me, he sounded more conflicted. Although he was glad more people were talking about the issue, he said he was “having a bit of a crisis of conscience.” Over the months he had worked on the woman’s case, the conventional wisdom about campus sexual assault had changed, with greater public focus on concerns about due process. “And insanely, I’m one of the people, for better or worse, who had some impact on shifting the narrative.” At the same time, he worried that the rescission could lead to a reaction of its own. He had received nearly a dozen new cases — all decided in the weeks immediately surrounding DeVos’s speech — in which he believed the schools had meted out unduly harsh penalties to make “a political counterstatement.” That prospect was as concerning to him as the school’s inaction on his female client’s case.

“There are real topics in this world that are zero-sum games,” he said; finding a balance between addressing sexual assault and ensuring due process didn’t need to be one. He found himself thinking that advocates on either side of the debate shared a sense of battlefield camaraderie, because only they saw what was really going on. “Sometimes you sit in this hearing and your heart breaks for both people,” he said. “Sometimes I walk out and think the whole thing is a [expletive]: terrible for him, terrible for her, terrible for the parents.” It would be disingenuous, he said, not to acknowledge the concerns of the other side: That if the process is broken, it’s broken at least as much for victims as the accused. That correction can become overcorrection in either direction. The pendulum swings both ways. It shouldn’t, he said, “but I don’t know how to stop it.”",The Takedown of Title IX,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/magazine/the-takedown-of-title-ix.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

In the early 1980s, Mr. Dillard returned to Operation Crossroads Africa as its director of finance. Although Mr. Dillard said he had found being employed by that organization rewarding and enjoyed traveling for work to West African nations like Nigeria, his tenure there was lasted less time than he would have liked because of a management shake-up a few years after his arrival.

After Mr. Dillard left the organization for a second time he struggled to find steady work. In 1990, Mr. Dillard began the first of several part-time accounting jobs at the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, a nonprofit organization. By 1995, he found steady, but part-time consulting work for the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts through a temp agency. He came close to finding a full-time job in 2001, but the offer was rescinded two days after the collapse of the twin towers.

“They didn’t need me or they had other issues that they needed to tend to,” Mr. Dillard said. “And then that was pretty much around that time there were no jobs being offered.”

After this rejection, Mr. Dillard continued to search fruitlessly for a full-time job. Although he was unable to secure one, he occasionally found work through a temp agency as a consultant or bookkeeper, including at Food Bank NYC and the United Nations Development Programme.

The income he earned was not enough to cover the rising rent on his Manhattan apartment. In 2008, no longer able to afford the rent, he became homeless.

He spent nearly three years sleeping at his sister’s apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, as well as at city shelters, before being placed in supportive housing at Hunterfly Trace in Brownsville. Mr. Dillard stayed there for seven years. During that time, because of his age, he began to consider himself retired but continued to pursue short-term employment opportunities.

Nine months ago, after winning a city housing lottery, Mr. Dillard moved into a one-bedroom apartment at the Bishop Mugavero Senior Apartments, a low-income housing residence in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. It is run by Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

Mr. Dillard, who receives monthly assistance totaling $1,356, which includes Social Security Income and food stamps, could not afford to furnish his new space. In April, the organization used $630 from the fund to buy him a couch and a sofa bed.

“I’ve never had a bed this big,” he said.

Mr. Dillard said he was starting to feel at home in his new neighborhood and seeking volunteer work at food pantries. Although he previously focused on looking for jobs in the nonprofit industry, he has expanded his search to the private sector.

Mr. Dillard said he was inspired to persevere by his hero, Senator John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war who, at age 81, is battling cancer while continuing to serve his country.

Partly this has to do with its cast, especially Reese Witherspoon, just as good playing saintly as she would be ruthless in “Election” a couple of months later. But what really made Roger Kumble’s film stand out were the timeless structure and timely embroideries: a fail-safe plot based on the 18th-century novel “Les Liaisons Dangereuses” combined with an arch ’90s sensibility and an inspired soundtrack — the denouement, set to the Verve’s “Bitter Sweet Symphony,” was worthy of Scorsese.

Later on Monday, and separately, a federal judge in Seattle also ordered a halt to the ban on transgender people serving in the military.

Mr. Trump announced the ban in a series of tweets in July. He said then that he had decided to do so after consulting with generals and military experts, although Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was given only a day’s notice.

Advocates for allowing transgender people in the military said they were not yet ready to declare victory.

“What the ruling signals is that both the Pentagon and the courts have recognized that Trump was stepping out of his lane when he tweeted,” said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, which advocates on behalf of the transgender community in the military.

But, he added: “This could be a long process. We just don’t know what happens next.”

Since Mr. Trump gave the order, the Pentagon has slow-walked it, telling transgender members of the military that they could continue to serve openly while the Pentagon decided how to handle the ban. Last month, the Pentagon paid for gender-reassignment surgery for an active-duty military member.

Staff Sgt. Ashlee Bruce of the Air Force, who began her transition this year, said young transgender troops like her have been on edge in recent months, but noted that even after Mr. Trump announced all transgender troops would be discharged, her commanders and the medical team overseeing her transition continued to reassure her. They cleared the way for her to begin hormone treatments and have her name changed before she leaves for an assignment in South Korea in March.

In announcing his ban, Mr. Trump tweeted that American forces could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender service members. But the RAND Corporation, in a 2016 study, found that allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military would “have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs” for the Pentagon.

It estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million, to $8.4 million annually, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. Citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected “little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness” in the United States.

In temporarily blocking the ban in October, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said that the administration’s justification for it was suspect and probably unconstitutional.

Defense Department officials said that new guidelines, a reinstatement of President Barack Obama’s opening of the military to transgender recruits, first reported by The Associated Press, mean that new recruits will have to undergo medical tests before enlisting.

The Obama administration announced last year that the Pentagon would start accepting transgender recruits in the summer 2017, but after taking over the department, Mr. Mattis delayed the policy’s implementation until the beginning of 2018, pending further review.

Last week, the Justice Department asked a federal court to further delay implementation until the court cases involving the ban are resolved.

Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said the way forward “seems very uncertain.”

“Many in the military seem open to the prospect of going forward, but Trump seems very opposed,” he wrote in an email. “It is also possible that the government could allow people to enlist but impose such onerous conditions that few would enlist.”",Transgender People Will Be Allowed to Enlist in the Military as a Court Case Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/transgender-military-pentagon.html

Earlier in the day, after casting his vote, Mr. Maduro threatened to ban from future elections those political parties that participated in the boycott. “They will disappear from the political map,” he declared.

The elections on Sunday unfolded against a backdrop of economic misery in Venezuela. According to statistics published last week by the National Assembly, inflation in November was nearly 57 percent — above the 50 percent mark that is commonly regarded as the threshold of hyperinflation. Profound shortages of food and medicine, the scarcity of cash and a general breakdown of public services continue to worsen by the day, driving a surge of emigration.

Opposition leaders argued that participation in Sunday’s voting would have served only to legitimize Mr. Maduro’s administration, which they — and some foreign governments — have called a dictatorship.

Despite the call for a boycott, an array of opposition candidates ran across the country, most as independents. Untethered from their parties — and from the scaffolding of support and money that such relationships bring — many of their campaigns barely registered with potential voters, providing little threat to the government-backed candidates of the United Socialist Party.

“I don’t know who any of the opposition candidates are,” said Jesús Gómez, 37, the chief of security for a supermarket chain, who was on his way to vote on Sunday in Ocumare del Tuy, a city south of Caracas, the capital.

All he was sure of was that he would vote — an expression of his rights, he said — and that he would cast his ballot against the Maduro government, even if he suspected that the electoral process would be riddled with fraud.

“Everything’s already prearranged,” he said. “This isn’t a secret at all.”

A majority of voters, however, stayed away: The national election board said Sunday night that about 47 percent of registered voters participated.

Throughout much of the day, many polling stations around the capital had barely a trickle of voters. In past elections, at least in some places, lines of people numbering in the hundreds snaked down the block and wait times stretched for hours.

“Total waste of time!” exclaimed Carlos Paez, a 44-year-old restaurant cook, who on Sunday morning was lifting weights with Edgar Martínez at a makeshift outdoor gym in downtown Caracas. Both men scoffed at the notion of voting; they had better things to do.

“So much deception,” added Mr. Martínez, 29, a bartender. “I’m young and I feel this disillusionment with what’s happening. Imagine that!”

Opposition voters who turned out in defiance of the boycott said they were compelled by civic duty despite an overarching feeling of futility.

“They are going to win,” Estela Prisco, 69, said of the United Socialist Party’s candidates, while walking a Schnauzer on her way to vote in downtown Caracas.

“But still there are people who come out against them,” she said. “And at the very least they will look and see that there are voters who stand against them.”

Abstention appeared to be so high that in some places pro-opposition voters worried that their side was at risk of losing its grasp on mayoralties that until Sunday had seemed guaranteed.

One such place was El Hatillo, an affluent municipality in eastern Caracas, where the opposition has controlled the mayor’s office since the election of Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, President Hugo Chávez, in 1999. On Sunday, supermarkets had more people standing in line than did polling stations.

“We lost this,” said Carlos Araque, 73, an engineer. “I have never seen this. Only a few are coming to vote.”

Yon Goicoechea, one of the five opposition candidates contending to be mayor of El Hatillo, said that widespread abstention and disarray among the opposition assured that the government’s party “will win without fraud.”

Pro-government voters seemed far less anxious about the course of the day, saying that the opposition had only itself to blame for not fully taking advantage of the opportunity to choose leaders.

“That’s called thoughtlessness,” Juan Atencio, 80, a retired hotel administrator, said of the low turnout. “They think we have the elections secured.”

Standing outside a polling center in central Caracas, he said he intended to vote for the socialist party’s candidate in his municipality, Libertador. “I’m hoping that people become conscious of the need to maintain the process,” he said, referring to the socialist movement started by Mr. Chávez and continued by Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Atencio acknowledged that the country was passing through a tenuous, challenging moment but said that changes in political systems were always hard and required perseverance. Parroting Mr. Maduro, he blamed foreign governments, including sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, for the country’s economic crisis.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader — who has said “I believe the women” and took the stand for weeks that Mr. Moore should drop out of the race — said last week that the race was for the people of Alabama to decide.

Mr. McConnell’s colleagues have discussed the possibility that, if Mr. Moore is elected, he could be subjected to an ethics investigation, or even expelled from the Senate.

In a tight race, any votes cast for a little-known write-in candidate, Lee Busby, might affect the outcome.

How are Democrats responding?

National Democratic organizations and the party’s most prominent figures had largely steered clear of the race, our political correspondents reported, which had initially left Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, to mostly go it alone. But in the last, frenzied days of the campaign, a constellation of outside liberal groups discreetly launched a multimillion-dollar operation to get out the Democratic vote. Mr. Jones is relying heavily on turnout by black voters.

Soon after my 50th birthday, 10 years ago, I started keeping a list of “Things I will do/things I won’t do when I get old.”



It was a highly judgmental, and super secret, accounting of all the things I thought my parents were doing wrong. My dad lied chronically about taking his meds. He refused to get a hearing aid, telling others to “up their audio” (he had been a television producer). My mom smoked behind my back (she thought) until the day she was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was all too easy to call them out, and I recognized over and over just how awful it is to become feeble, sick and increasingly absent-minded, or worse.

Over the next decade I accumulated many pages of dos and don’ts, even as I fretted about exactly when I’d be old enough to start following my own advice. Recently I heard a sociologist on the radio call people in their early 60s, “the young old.” I imagine that my “young adult” nieces might consider me “old, old” already, but I don’t feel ready yet to start taking my own advice. I’m still working on building my list, not implementing it.

The entries on that list reflect my frustration of seeing the price my parents paid for their stubbornness. Take my mother’s terrifying driving, for instance. A growing number of fender benders, and worse, didn’t faze her, and she would not listen to any talk of her fading ability behind the wheel. In desperation, I reported Mom to the D.M.V. and they called her in for a road test. She failed it, and her license was revoked. It humiliated Mom, and tormented me.

Here’s how it appears on my list:

“If my driving capability is questioned, I will not reject the comment out of hand because I am afraid of losing my independence. I hope there will be self-driving cars by then. If nothing else works, I hope someone will turn me in.”

My biggest worry as I watched my parents grow old was their increasing physical frailty. Who hasn’t heard that hip fractures from falls are a leading cause of death among the elderly? I know my father had, if only because we talked about it with him ad nauseam. I pointed out the consequences of his own mother’s pride in refusing a cane or walker: At age 84, Grandma fell while riding the New York City subway alone, and that fall led over the months that followed to her death.",Things I’ll Do Differently When I’m Old,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/well/family/thing-ill-do-differently-when-im-old.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Photo ID laws are written to make it difficult for people like them to vote. And that’s exactly what happens. A study by Zoltan Hajnal, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, comparing the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, found that the voter ID law kept black voters from the polls. After Alabama implemented its strict voter ID law, turnout in its most racially diverse counties declined by almost 5 percentage points, which is even more than the drop in diverse counties in other states.

The study controls for numerous factors that might otherwise affect an election: how much money was spent on the races; the state’s partisan makeup; changes in electoral laws like early voting and day-of registration; and shifts in incentives to vote, like which party controls the state legislature.

In Alabama, an estimated 118,000 registered voters do not have a photo ID they can use to vote. Black and Latino voters are nearly twice as likely as white voters to lack such documentation.

In other words, Alabama’s law is nothing but a naked attempt to suppress the voting rights of people of color. That’s why my organization, Greater Birmingham Ministries, with the help of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, has sued the state to block the photo ID law. The case will go to trial in February.

When the law was passed in 2011, it so reeked of discrimination that state politicians didn’t bother to submit it to the federal government for approval, as Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required. For decades, Section 5 had acted as a crucial prophylactic, stopping discriminatory voting laws before any election. Instead the ID law remained dormant until June 2013, when the Supreme Court’s devastating ruling in Shelby County v. Holder suspended Section 5’s preclearance requirement.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a United States senator, applauded the ruling as “good news” for the South. For Mr. Sessions, who called the Voting Rights Act an “intrusive” piece of legislation, it was a victory. But for voters in Alabama and the rest of the South, it was terrible news.

It left states like Alabama, Texas and North Carolina free to test the limits of voter suppression. Indeed, after the decision, Alabama announced the photo ID law would go into effect without federal approval.

The photo ID law isn’t the only obstacle in front of Alabama voters. My organization is also challenging the state’s felon disfranchisement law, which affects an estimated 250,000 people here — 15 percent of Alabama’s black voting age population, but fewer than five percent of whites.

The law bars people with felonies of “moral turpitude” from voting. For decades such crimes were ill defined, but once included things like miscegenation. A new law narrowed the list of disfranchising crimes, but a federal judge ruled this summer that the state is not required to inform people with convictions who couldn’t vote under the old law that they may now register to vote.

Sadly, on Tuesday, many of the voters who would most benefit from picking lawmakers who will represent their interests in the Senate will be kept away from the polls. Those voters are disparaged for their purported disengagement with the election, while the state’s voter suppression campaign is largely ignored.

We’ve made too much progress to tolerate this. Federal courts must reject the voter ID law. Congress needs to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full strength.

In a brief visit to a Russian air base in Syria, where he was greeted by President Bashar al-Assad, Mr. Putin again said that Russia’s military had achieved its mission and would head home, a pledge he first made in March 2016 and has broken repeatedly in the past.

In Egypt, Mr. Putin and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi discussed several issues that reflected Moscow’s expanding role. They confirmed at a news conference that Russia had agreed to resume direct tourist flights to Egypt, suspended after the bombing of a Russian airliner in the Sinai Peninsula in 2015, which could restore billions of dollars in revenue. And they appeared to confirm the signing of a contract for Russia to build a $30 billion nuclear plant, Egypt’s first. Late last month, the two countries were reported to be exploring an agreement for the Russian air force to use Egyptian military bases.

The trip to Turkey was the last scheduled for the day, with the agenda focused on political talks to end the war in Syria and the sale of an advanced Russian S-400 air missile defense system to Turkey. Russia has in the past refused such a sale, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said at a joint news conference on Monday that the two countries would this week “come together to conclude necessary work for S-400.”

The session was the eighth time Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan have met this year, and lately they have been getting together every two weeks.

Russia has taken full advantage of the American reluctance to engage in various Middle East conflicts, especially Syria, to reconstruct relations with various capitals like Cairo, which expelled the Soviets in the early 1970s after years of close military cooperation.

Although Mr. Putin is assured of victory in the 2018 presidential election in March, he is seeking a record turnout and a record level of support, according to reports in the Russian news media.

To do that, he needs both to generate excitement in a lackluster campaign and to at least appear focused on domestic issues, according to various analysts, even if he personally seems far more animated when discussing foreign policy than fixing roads. Hence, he wants to significantly reduce the Russian role in Syria before campaigning begins in earnest in February.

“People are not that much concerned about Syria, it is a faraway land that people do not know much about,” said Konstantin von Eggert, a political analyst and talk show host on independent television. If Russians think about it at all, he and other analysts said, they typically wonder why the Kremlin is spending money in a region long peopled by savages bent on killing one another.

In Syria, Mr. Putin repeated that Russian forces had defeated the threat from Islamic militants that they had come to confront two years ago, although many believe that the real purpose was to shore up Mr. Assad, at the time Russia’s last ally in the region.

“In two years, the Russian armed forces, together with the Syrian Army have defeated the most combat-capable group of international terrorists,” Mr. Putin said in a speech at the Hmeimim air base in Syria. “In connection with this, I have made a decision: A significant part of the Russian military contingent in the Syrian Arab Republic is returning home, to Russia.”

As usual, Mr. Putin left himself plenty of wiggle room by saying that “a significant part” of the troops would come home. He also noted that Russia established a permanent presence, with the Hmeimim base and an expanded naval station at Tartus, Syria.

Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, was even more equivocal, saying that there was no specific timetable for the withdrawal. “It is clear that it is not a matter of a day,” he said.

Some analysts said that Mr. Putin’s visit and announcement of the withdrawal could be seen in part as an effort to pressure Mr. Assad, who up to now has shown remarkable willingness to defy Russia’s stated goal of a substantive political process despite his deep reliance on Russian power.

Russia has not only propped up Mr. Assad’s beleaguered army, but has also helped push international peace talks away from an earlier consensus that Mr. Assad step down before any transition could be negotiated.

But Moscow does not want to indefinitely support a weakened Syrian state with questionable legitimacy. Russia has lost hundreds of military personnel in the fighting, and is spending heavily on the war effort and on propping up the government. And Mr. Putin is eager to declare victory, not only militarily but to cement his leadership of an international diplomatic effort that he sees as crowning Russia’s return to the world stage as an equal to the United States.

Syrian opposition negotiators taking part in the United Nations-led talks in Geneva broadly welcomed Mr. Putin’s troop withdrawal order. “It will help us, it’s good, we are very positive,” said Hind Kabawat, a member of the opposition negotiating team.

They expressed the hope that Russia was now ready to use whatever leverage it had with Mr. Assad to press for compromises that would inject momentum into the Geneva talks. Other analysts noted that if nothing of substance happened in Geneva, or on the Syrian battlefield, then Mr. Putin’s announcement of a troop withdrawal would have had more to do with Russia’s domestic politics than with Syria.

In Turkey, Mr. Putin was expected to seek Ankara’s support in containing Islamist militias in the northern Syrian provinces of Idlib and Aleppo, and would be pressing Mr. Erdogan to recognize Mr. Assad as the legitimate leader of Syria, said Hakan Aksay, a Russia analyst and columnist for the independent Turkish news site, T24.

Mr. Erdogan said at the news conference that after discussing Syria with Mr. Putin on Monday, the next step was to hold a second meeting in Sochi, Russia. He called the close relationship between Russia and Turkey “meaningful for the stability in the region.”

Turkey still calls for the removal of Mr. Assad but, like most in the opposition, no longer insists on his removal as a precondition of peace talks.

Turkey also adamantly opposes having Syrian Kurds at the negotiating table, Mahir Unal, a spokesman for Mr. Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party, told a recent meeting of international journalists. The Syrian Kurdish groups are supported by the United States, but Turkey says they are allied with the outlawed separatist movement, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, and Ankara is increasingly concerned that weapons could be transferred to insurgents in Turkey.",Whirlwind Putin Tour Highlights Moscow’s New Reach in Mideast,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/europe/putin-syria-russia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The House Judiciary Committee’s approval of obstruction charges against Richard Nixon in 1974 does not show otherwise. The Congress then had evidence of specific illegal acts supporting a charge of obstruction, such as the use of “hush money” to silence witnesses. Nixon’s intent or motive while performing otherwise undisputed constitutional responsibilities was not the issue.

It is very much an issue in the case of Donald Trump and possible obstruction in the Russia matter. Yet the establishment of motive is a legal determination that tests Congress’s capacity for thorough, complex investigations of this kind. In the Bill Clinton impeachment process, the House and Senate showed little appetite for any serious investigation. The House conducted no witness depositions, and the Senate only three. The Republican leadership prosecuting the case relied wholly in the House, and primarily in the Senate, on the findings of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Congress may like the security of impeaching for clearly illegal conduct, which helps it fend off the accusation that it is playing politics, but it faces significant limits in these investigative endeavors.

Congress must struggle to function in these inquiries with the necessary secrecy, professional resources and time. It must do all this while containing internal partisan political conflicts and pressures. And it must act while mindful of the sensitivity of a legislative probe into an executive’s motivations when performing otherwise constitutionally authorized acts.

Impeachment is not a substitute for the criminal justice system. In cases like this, it requires the support of that system — the results of professional investigation and judgment.

The attacks on Mr. Mueller, together with Mr. Trump’s lawyers’ embrace of an aggressive legal theory, put in question whether the Department of Justice will be permitted to complete its investigation. Should the president next take the step of firing Mr. Mueller, he would end professionally conducted fact-finding on this crucial question of motive. Congress is then left to respond by trying to complete the department’s job or to proceed to impeachment and a showdown over which branch can claim primacy for its constitutional functions. It faces major challenges in accomplishing the first task, and the second course may lead to constitutional conflict in which, upon impeachment and conviction, the president refuses to vacate his office and the Supreme Court is called on to settle the dispute. Call it Bush v. Gore, the Sequel, another make-or-break case deciding who will be — or, in this instance, remain — president.

The preservation of presidential accountability to the rule of law requires the protection of the department’s role. If the professional prosecutors conclude that they will not bring a charge of obstruction, Congress will have the benefit of the evidence accumulated in the investigation in making its own judgment about impeachment.

Or the special counsel may determine that indictment is justified and proceed to prosecute, which will also force the issue of whether the president can be indicted while in office. The president is highly likely to argue the case for his immunity, but he should have no confidence that he will succeed. Beginning with United States v. Nixon, through later decisions in the Clinton years against presidential claims of privilege or of immunity from civil suit, the courts have stood firmly behind the proposition that the president is not above the law.

Whether or not an investigation concludes with an indictment, Congress will gain the tested evidence that it needs to assess the basis for impeachment for obstruction. Congress and the department would each be able to do what they are cut out to do. Nothing prevents criminal investigations and impeachment processes from running concurrently, as they have in the past.

But that only hardened our resolve to take a closer look. We redoubled our efforts to report on the military and opposition groups ensnared in what would ultimately be a 36-year conflict that claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people, mostly indigenous Maya, between 1960 and 1996. Some 45,000 victims disappeared, while more than one million people were displaced. Yet this conflict raged on in relative obscurity and mystery, even as the 1980s ushered in an era of horrific violence.

Traveling by bus from Guatemala City and into the Quiché highlands to the northwest, the urban bustle gave way to a dramatic landscape of rolling, verdant hills, though the awe inspired by that vista was soon displaced by a sense of menace. Army checkpoints appeared 30 minutes outside of Chichicastenango, where bus and car passengers lined up to show identity papers. Foreign tourists were generally exempt from the low-level suspicion and harassment shown to the Maya.

I was familiar with Guatemala’s turbulent political history and the C.I.A.’s support of its 1954 coup. But I was relatively new to the daily terror tactics of Central America where U.S.-backed troops used fear and violence to contain a growing left-wing insurgency. But unlike in El Salvador, where the United States openly provided military advisers and equipment, American support for Guatemala’s military government was purposefully hidden and downplayed.

The military’s campaign of violence and terror was carried out with rigor and exactitude. The way to multiply a political murder’s horror was to leave corpses in full public view, like on the side of the road with a slit throat and torn-off clothing. “This could happen to you,” was the clear message sent to potential victims, warning them of the fate that awaited those suspected of supporting the rebels.

These weren’t peripheral incidents with marginal players but a closely-managed pacification campaign whose violent counterinsurgency tactics were supported by other right-wing anti-Communist countries and their military attachés and trainers in Guatemala. Taiwan provided anti-Communist psy-ops training; Argentina contributed counterintelligence and interrogation techniques from its own Dirty War; South Africa supplied communications equipment and training; while Israel provided weapons for the soldiers and infantry. A small number of Spanish-speaking U.S. Special Forces troops worked in the field and at military training camps.

In January 1982, I traveled with Christopher Dickey, The Washington Post’s correspondent, to the military headquarters in Santa Cruz del Quiché to speak with the Guatemalan Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Benedicto Lucas García. The French-trained general implemented a scorched-earth policy aimed at eliminating a growing insurgency in the indigenous areas of the western highlands. The rebellion was at its peak, and the Guatemalan guerrillas considered themselves allies of Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the leftist F.M.L.N in El Salvador.

The general invited Chris and me on a helicopter flight over the mountainous farming area of the Quiché, where they targeted the enemy with simple, deadly logic: Anyone running from our white Bell helicopter was either a guerrilla or a sympathizer.

Accompanied by two door-gunners and an intelligence officer, Gen. Lucas García sat in the co-pilot’s seat and directed the flight around the rural areas. We were 15 minutes from the provincial capital, flying about 1,500 feet, when he spotted a group of women running away from the approaching helicopter. He ordered the pilot to circle the farm below and bank the helicopter hard so the door gunners could have a better view.

Then he yelled out the command to open fire, “Dale! Dale!” — “Give it to them! Give it to them!”

The gunners blasted away in a hail of smoke and spent cartridges, the pilot turned and banked again, noisily circling above as civilians were cut down with the American-supplied M60 machine guns. Gen. Lucas García explained to us that since the campesinos (peasant farmers) had run away from the helicopter, they had to have been guilty. When The Washington Post published Chris’s story, Gen. Lucas García denied he ever ordered his men to fire, even though a photograph of the door-gunner in action (Slide 3) accompanied the story.

On various occasions in the early 1980s, I left El Salvador to work in Guatemala, photographing in the Ixil triangle and western highlands. I used a Rollei 2¼ camera, a tripod and black-and-white film. The film, from Todos Santos and Nebaj, had been in storage and mostly unseen since 1985.

At the time, the violence in the highlands was fearful, mysterious and intimidating. Asking villagers in Todos Santos and Nebaj to sit for a portrait, I felt the best I could hope for was a glimpse of their dignity and independence and what they were desperately trying to hold onto in the midst of the cruel, scorched-earth injustices and devastating military sweeps: Exactly what the blasé embassy spokesman had dismissively wanted us to overlook.

One study estimated that 47 percent of human behaviors are of this habitual variety.

Yet many people persist in buying branded products even when equivalent generics are available. These choices are noteworthy for drugs, when generics and branded options are chemically equivalent. Why continue to buy a name-brand aspirin when the same chemical compound sits nearby at a cheaper price? Scientists have already verified that the two forms of aspirin are identical. A little personal experimentation would presumably reassure you that the generic has the same effect.

Our common failure to experiment extends well past generics, as one recent study illustrates. On Feb. 5, 2014, London Underground workers went on a 48-hour strike, forcing the closings of several tube stops. The affected commuters had to find alternate routes.

When the strike ended, most people reverted to their old patterns. But roughly one in 20 stuck with the new route, shaving 6.7 minutes from what had been an average 32-minute commute.

The closings imposed by the strike forced experimentation with alternate routes, yielding valuable results. And if the strike had been longer, even more improvements would probably have been discovered.

Yet the fact that many people needed a strike to force them to experiment reveals the deep roots of a common reluctance to experiment. For example, when I think of my favorite restaurants, the ones I have visited many times, it is striking how few of the menu items I have tried. And when I think of all the lunch places near my workplace, I realize that I keep going to the same places again and again.

Habits are powerful. We persist with many of them because we tend to give undue emphasis to the present. Trying something new can be painful: I might not like what I get and must forgo something I already enjoy. That cost is immediate, while any benefits — even if they are large — will be enjoyed in a future that feels abstract and distant. Yes, I want to know what else my favorite restaurant does well, but today I just want my favorite dish.

Overconfidence also holds us back. I am unduly certain in my guesses of what the alternatives will be like, even though I haven’t tried them.

Finally, many so-called choices are not really choices at all. Walking down the supermarket aisle, I do not make a considered decision about soda. I don’t even pause at the generics. I act without thinking; I automatically grab bottles of Diet Coke as I wheel my cart by.

This is true not only in our personal lives. Executives and policymakers fail to experiment in their jobs, and these failures can be particularly costly. For example, in hiring, executives often apply their preconceived notions of which applicants will be a “good fit” as prospective employees. Yet those presumptions are nothing more than guesses and are rarely given the scrutiny of experimentation.

Hiring someone who doesn’t appear to be a good fit is surely risky, yet it might also prove the presumptions wrong, an outcome that is especially valuable when these presumptions amount to built-in advantages for men or whites or people from economically or culturally advantaged backgrounds.

For government policymakers, experimentation is a thorny issue. We are right to be wary of “experimenting” in the sense of playing with people’s lives. Yet we should also be wary of an automatic bias in favor of the status quo. That can amount to a Panglossian belief that the current policy is best, whereas the current policy may actually be a wobbly structure held together by overconfidence, historical accident and the power of precedent.

Experimentation is an act of humility, an acknowledgment that there is simply no way of knowing without trying something different.

Understanding that truth is a first step, but it is important to act on it.

Mr. Farb noted that even these representatives of Lenin and Stalin had fashioned themselves in a Western style, with one almost resembling Cary Grant, and another Charles de Gaulle.","It’s hard to believe, but in 1977, the United States government tapped Nathan Farb, a left-leaning, hippie, Jewish artist to represent America on a public relations trip to the Soviet Union.

Let that sink in for a minute.

During the Carter administration, the U.S. Information Agency organized a traveling photography exhibition, aptly titled “Photography USA,” that toured the Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union. It was part of a multi-year effort by the U.S. government to present positive portrayals of the country — behind enemy lines, no less — which makes it that much stranger that someone like Mr. Farb would have been chosen as a cultural ambassador.

“I think your view of how different I was from, say, a jazz musician on the road for U.S.I.A. is a little overstated,” Mr. Farb deadpanned. “The world was clamoring for American music and jazz. And they sent every great musician around the world, multiple times. Does the world want American cars? Not really. The world wants American culture. And it certainly was that way then.”

A selection of images from the resulting project, “The Russians,” is on exhibit at the Wende Museum in Culver City, Calif., as a part of its mission to focus on the Cold War. His project depicts citizens of Novosibirsk, a Siberian city closer to Kazakhstan and Mongolia than it is to Western Europe. (He called it “the rough equivalent of Cleveland.”) He was included on the six-week trip after he had done a similar tour in Romania, and then begged to be included on the Soviet trip. The desire to visit the Soviet Union was personal for Mr. Farb, since he was raised in Lake Placid, N.Y., and was acutely aware of capitalism’s huge differences in wealth and class.

“I became an 11- or 12-year-old Communist, you might say,” he said. “I grew up in a town where there was enormous wealth, and enormous poverty. It was painful, because I went to school with children who did not have socks to put on inside their galoshes in the winter.

“I think that’s where my early interest in Marx and Lenin came as a boy.”

During the project, Mr. Farb set up a mobile studio to photograph the locals as a demonstration of the technology. And he gave his subjects a Polaroid image as a memento of the experience. Little did they know, however, that there was another, secret, photo. In what feels like something out of a John le Carré novel, Mr. Farb was loading his 4×5 camera with Polaroid Type 55 film, which created both a positive and a negative image.

“I felt I was gaming both the U.S. State Department officials, and I was gaming the Russians,” he said. ‘Nobody really understood what I was doing with the Polaroids. That I had a negative, and that I was going to be able to bring this stuff back.”

He sent the negatives back with his personal mail, through the diplomatic pouches available to him.

As for the photographs, they depict a community that is much less foreign than we might imagine. The fashion represents ’70s style, with jean jackets and paisley prints. According to Mr. Farb, many of the women made their own clothes, and had occasional access to magazines from the outside world, so they joined the funky fresh fashion craze, like farmers hitting Studio 54.

There was also a unique aspect to the city, given its remote location.

“Every morning I would go down to my studio, and there would be these women cleaning up,” he said. “And they would sing the most hauntingly beautiful music. On the second or third day, I thought, ‘Of course, I’m not in Europe, and I’m not in Asia. I’m somewhere in between.’”

The reality was that Mr. Farb had a minder, a member of the Communist Party, to keep an eye on him. Fortunately, he was able to get a photograph of the entire party cadre, including his minder and, yes, it’s as awesome as it sounds.

The photo shows five dour, serious-looking men, including one who’s a dead ringer for Werner Herzog. Mr. Farb noted that even these representatives of Lenin and Stalin had fashioned themselves in a Western style, with one almost resembling Cary Grant, and another Charles de Gaulle.

There’s a healthy dose of the unexpected in these pictures, from a distance of 40 years, including a young woman with a pronounced mustache, who was apparently the mistress of one of the party chiefs, or the large older woman with the head scarf who’s rocking a serious set of metal teeth.

While the humor and political relevance might make “The Russians” seem of the moment, to Mr. Farb, the pictures are really meant to humanize our fellow man.

Frankly, he became emotional when describing how it felt to have a contemporary audience, online and on the wall, interact with his subjects, many of whom have died in the intervening years. When asked what his greatest desire is, when people look at the photographs, he simply replied: “I want them to love these people.”

To earn their trust, Mr. Donovan had to figuratively get off the bench.
But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.","Chris Donovan arrived in Flint after the scandal over the Michigan city’s contaminated water supply had been dominating national headlines. He was there, just like dozens of other journalists, covering the crisis. “When I first went, everything I was photographing was really obvious,” he said of his initial trip in 2015. “It was people handing out water, protests and people showering with bottled water.”

But the more he got to know the city and its people, the more frustrated he became with the popular narrative: that Flint was a bad place. So after the city’s turn in the breaking news spotlight, he has returned each year to tell the beleaguered city’s other stories.

He could relate: His hometown, Saint John, New Brunswick, is very much like Flint, with both industry and population shrinking. “I had no idea what to expect,” Mr. Donovan said, other than unemployed factory workers. He did find plenty of idled laborers, but he also found a city greater than the water crisis that still seemed to publicly define it long after the media had moved on.

Mr. Donovan was so dedicated to documenting that lesser-known side of Flint and its people that his friends gently teased him about spending spring break there. Mr. Donovan laughed and said it fits. He could either go back to his hometown in Canada or travel the much shorter five hours to Flint from Toronto, where he lives.

“I’ll continue to go back, and I’ll continue working in Flint probably the rest of my life, just because I have an attachment to the city and the story,” Mr. Donovan says.

His latest story is about the last high school football team in the city, The Jaguars. The team was born from the merger of two schools, Southwestern and Northwestern Academies, and their two teams: the Knights and the Wildcats. It also nods to the athletic history of the city, which has produced dozens of professional football players over the years.

Chris Wilson was one of those. He graduated from Flint Northern in 2000 and went on to play professionally, first in the Canadian Football League and for Washington’s N.F.L. team. He is now back home overseeing the school’s entire program — from 8-year-olds playing flag football to the varsity level playing full-contact.

He has a simple but much-needed mission: To instill hope and purpose in these young men, in much the same way those values were instilled in him.

“By having sports start early, not only do we put out better talent and create a better brand of football, but now kids can know how to go to school and get their work down and strive for a goal,” Mr. Wilson said. Rather than turning to the streets to make quick cash, young people can discover new options and possibilities for a positive life and career though the discipline and teamwork of sports.

The young men of the Flint Jaguars are, by all accounts, resilient and intelligent, growing up hard and playing a hard sport. To earn their trust, Mr. Donovan had to figuratively get off the bench. “A big part of the way that I work is sharing my own experiences with these kids to show them that I’m a human, that I’m not just there to take pictures and leave.”

He played basketball with them and talked with them, and their comfort with him is evident in his photos. Mr. Donovan is invisible on the field and the locker room, and the Jaguars are at ease around him enough to be themselves in their sport and in their emotions, whether those be grief, intensity or exultation. Under the stadium lights, or against the green school bus seats, they show up as young adherents of a beloved American sport.

Just as the rest of Flint has faced tough times, the school struggles financially, to the point that last year the sports program was hanging by a thread. The city is still plagued by toxic water, and off the field the players must contend with the dangers of every day life. But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.

Trey Huddleston gets ready for the homecoming dance while his mother watches; Alone Branch intently works out in the weight room, whether its football season or not. Jalynn Bond is somber one moment, walking through the neighborhood where he lost his brother to gun violence; the next, he’s grinning and flexing at his teammates in the locker room because one of them dared to suggest Mr. Bond was smaller.

As is his habit, Mr. Wilson stands at the center of them (Slide 7), leading a prayer to inspire the team before taking the field. At a game against their rivals, Saginaw High, a brawl erupted between players, and two police officers used pepper spray to break them up. Mr. Wilson and the other coaches restored order and handed out suspensions, but both he and Mr. Donovan criticized the use of pepper spray in ending a scuffle between teenagers, none of whom, Mr. Wilson noted, were being hostile to teachers or coaches.

The program still struggles, just like Flint still struggles. But while Mr. Wilson talks about those challenges and the sacrifices that have been made to keep this program running, he couches it in terms meant to motivate his Jaguars in their daily lives.

“If you haven’t folded already, in a poor city in America, dealing with a water crisis, guess what?” he said. “There’s nothing else out there for you. There’s nothing that’s gonna hit you harder than that.”

There were only a few studies that directly compared them, but they suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy may be even more effective at reducing symptoms and at resolving the anxiety disorders, and that the combination of medication and C.B.T. may be better than either was alone. The drugs were associated with a variety of adverse events, though they did not find the association with suicide attempts that has led to a black box warning on S.S.R.I.s. Still, they have not ruled out those dangers: “The difference may be due to underreporting and monitoring of suicide attempts in clinical trials,” Dr. Wang said.

Dr. Stephen P.H. Whiteside, the director of the Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the Mayo Clinic, who was one of the authors of the meta analysis, said, “if your child has difficulties with anxiety, first of all, it’s treatable. There are a variety of interventions that can be helpful.”

So which of those children — the parent-clinger, the dog-fearer, the school-avoider — needs psychotherapy or psychopharmacology?

“Anxiety happens in kids,” said Dr. Christopher K. Varley, a professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “It does not always need treatment.” And it does not always look exactly like what adults think of as anxiety, he said. Kids can have physical symptoms, or become disruptive; headaches and stomachaches and tantrums can all mean that a child is anxious.

“The important questions to me are, is this a problem, is it getting in the way of functioning, is it creating stress for the child and the family, is it causing pain and suffering?” he said.

“A big thing for families is that sometimes anxiety can lead to avoidance behavior in social settings and in school,” Dr. Fernandez said. But staying away from school is only going to make the problem worse, she said. “As a parent, all you want to do is make your child feel safe and feel comfortable, and if they’re saying, I only feel safe and comfortable home with my door shut, that can only exacerbate the problem.”

The most helpful form of therapy, Dr. Whiteside said, according to the evidence, is exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves helping kids face their fears in a supportive environment. “If they’re afraid of dogs, they have to practice petting dogs; if they’re afraid of talking to people, practice talking to people.” That seems to be of greater value for children with these problems than, for example, therapies based on changing thought patterns, or distractions, or even therapy aimed at deeper insight into the fears.

The message of exposure therapy, Dr. Whiteside said, is that the situations the child is avoiding are not as dangerous as the child’s anxiety would suggest, and that the child can cope with the anxiety. “It’s an uncomfortable feeling that you can handle,” he said, and the more the child handles it, the more proficient the child will become.

But this takes skill and experience on the therapist’s part, and an investment of time and resources by the family. “We found that C.B.T. reports the most consistent outcomes compared to placebo, but it’s time-consuming and sometimes in rural areas it’s not available,” Dr. Wang said.

The question of medication may arise for children with moderate to severe anxiety, and perhaps ideally for a child who is already getting psychotherapy. But of course, not everyone has access to the experts, or to the recommended forms of therapy. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed by primary care doctors, pediatricians or family physicians, doing their best to help their patients, sometimes getting guidance from a psychiatrist by phone.

“Even though it’s a common problem and there are treatments that work, there are still profound problems in the United States with access to psychotherapists who are versed in psychotherapy techniques that have been demonstrated to help,” Dr. Varley said. “And there clearly is a paucity of child psychiatrists.”

In an editorial accompanying the recent meta-analysis, researchers hailed the large numbers of children included, but warned that many children don’t respond fully to treatment, and that children who suffer from one form of anxiety disorder are often at high risk to develop another.

That kind of event can change one’s perspective, and for the photographer Cig Harvey, her brush with vehicular death in 2015 inspired her new series “You an Orchestra You a Bomb,” recently released by Schilt Publishing, which also opens as a solo exhibition at Robert Mann in New York on December 7. With its strong emphasis on evocative color and objects culled from the natural world, the project touches upon magic, mystery and fairy tales. One easily imagines Narnia just through the wardrobe door or Hogwarts awaiting at the end of the train ride. (Surprisingly, Ms. Harvey, who was born in England, has never read the Harry Potter books.)

As is her custom, the series features Ms. Harvey’s six-year-old daughter, Scout, along with other relatives and friends. And the narrative is clearly propelled by the motivations of a mother, one enraptured by life after a near-death experience.

“The spark was ignited after I was in a serious car accident,” she said. “Then I started to make work about my relationship to life itself, and how fragile that felt in that moment.”

Photo

While her previous projects, including the books “Gardening at Night” and “You Look At Me Like An Emergency,” featured images that were preconceived and carefully constructed, Ms. Harvey began shooting in a more documentary style after her accident, roaming around with a camera in hand. While she still poses her subjects, her creativity pushed her to explore the world further, and to allow life to present serendipitous moments, like an old man jumping from a dock into the sea, or a pregnant friend standing stock-still on a misty beach.

“Every day, I sought out in everyday places images that made me jolt; that created some type of awe, and made me gasp because it was so beautiful,” she said. “And most of them are just in my backyard.”

Her book and exhibit carefully recreate that sense of childhood wonder, mixing saturated colors with verdant symbols and engaging text, allowing viewers to contemplate that sense of the unknown, but from a place of joy rather than anxiety. Ms. Harvey’s stories — poetic interludes sprinkled through the photographic narrative — add to the feeling that one has climbed into the back of her head, like in the film “Being John Malkovich,” and reality is twisted as a result.

Photo

Whether it’s a child’s tooth tied to red string, a platter of four-leaf clovers, a box full of butterflies, or a table covered with tangerines, that feeling of rapture, of youthful exuberance, permeates the pages. One vignette sums up her obsession with magic — with the things we feel but cannot understand:

“At a science-themed birthday I sit with the 5-year-olds in the front row, gasping at the impossibility of it all. / I keep mixing up science and magic. / Please do let me stop you, as you begin to explain the physics.”

Other artists, notably Sally Mann, have featured their children as a way of exploring universal themes, but the young women in this book seem like stand-ins for storybook characters. Whether they’re holding dead bugs or peeking out from behind a red curtain, the feeling is hard to escape, particularly with an image near the book’s end that features Scout dressed in a cape like Little Red Riding Hood.

Because tragedy is always with us, fairy tales have traditionally dealt with themes of life and death in exaggerated ways, so to explain difficult ideas to children. As a mother, Ms. Harvey is clearly grappling with these issues that suffuse her photographs.

Photo

“I became a better photographer when I became mother, and by better, I mean the work got more complicated and less decorative, because my world became more complicated,” she said. “The world became more beautiful, and it also became more terrifying. This book is about those two extremes.”

In the end, that’s what Ms. Harvey hopes people will get from “You an Orchestra You a Bomb” — a sense of being transported and, in turn, transformed by a perspective that helps them appreciate the ephemeral quality of life.

“Everything feels very temporary,” she said. “We have these short lives. How can we pack as much into them, and love fiercely, protect fiercely, give fiercely, deal with difficult things, and come through other side?”

LONDON — Emboldened by President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Benjamin Netanyahu paid the first visit to the European Union headquarters by an Israeli prime minister in 22 years on Monday, to seek similar endorsement from the 28-nation bloc.

The answer, though, was clear: no.

The bloc’s members are not unified in their attitudes toward Israel, but the European Union’s official position is that it supports what Federica Mogherini, its foreign policy chief, called the “international consensus” from which Mr. Trump departed last week when he announced a reversal of decades of American diplomacy.

The European Union, she said, remains committed to a two-state settlement for the Israelis and the Palestinians, with “Jerusalem as the capital of both.” The bloc is the biggest provider of aid to the Palestinians.

Both Mr. Netanyahu and European officials referred to White House plans to begin a new effort for peace in the Middle East that is being led by Trump advisers, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The Israeli leader also expressed optimism that other countries would follow the American move on Jerusalem.

“I believe that all, or most, of the European countries will move their embassies to Jerusalem, recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and engage robustly with us for security, prosperity and peace,” Mr. Netanyahu said.

Mr. Netanyahu met on Sunday with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, where he received a taste of what was to come, before flying on to Brussels. France said the status of Jerusalem could only be worked out in a final settlement between Israelis and Palestinians to their decades-old disputes.

After meeting with European Union foreign ministers, Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital “doesn’t obviate peace, it makes peace possible, because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, it’s the foundation of peace.”

Mr. Trump’s move last week set off protests in many parts of the Islamic world and led to airstrikes on Gaza after Palestinian militants there lobbed missiles into Israel. Mr. Netanyahu castigated the European Union over the weekend for what he said was its “hypocrisy” in criticizing Mr. Trump but not the rocket attacks or incitement against Israel.

Ms. Mogherini said she wished to “condemn in the strongest possible way all attacks on Jews everywhere in the world, including in Europe and on Israel and on Israeli citizens.”

Among the European Union members, several smaller countries — including Hungary and the Czech Republic — favor a closer bond with Israel. Last week, the Czech Republic said it would consider moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem but then seemed to retreat, saying it accepted Israel’s sovereignty over only the western part of Jerusalem.

The Czech foreign minister, Lubomir Zaoralek, said on Monday that Mr. Trump’s announcement last week “can’t help us.”

“I am convinced that is it impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution,” Mr. Zaoralek said, according to Reuters, as he and other European foreign ministers gathered for breakfast with Mr. Netanyahu. “We are talking about an Israeli state, but at the same time a Palestinian state.”

The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the Europeans had been waiting several months for the new American plan, and were growing weary of waiting. “If one is not forthcoming,” he said, “the European Union will have to take the initiative.”

Some Israelis, who see a pro-Palestinian bias among many Europeans, have been angered by European moves such as requiring that goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank be clearly labeled with their provenance. Additionally, many European countries have been seeking closer ties with Iran since it reached a nuclear deal with the United States and other powers.

In “Tape for the Turn of the Year,” there were moments when he debated stomping on his coil of paper.

When he left the house he unspooled the whole thing, he wrote, and brought it along, in case of fire. (Did Kerouac lug his scroll around like a football?) “I’m so tired / you can’t imagine,” he tells his readers, nearing the end. He thanks us for coming along.

On the most bedrock level, Ammons was a nature poet. Daily he was out amid the moss and grackles and the zucchini vines and the roadkill. He didn’t issue “cry of the loon” writing, however, to borrow an old New Yorker magazine put-down of overwrought nature prose.

If he saw a jay out before sunrise, it was probably “wheeling & dealing.” His poems are dense with weather reports, emotional and literal. His book “Garbage” meditates on what we’ve done to our blue-green planet as well as to our minds.

If I tend not to regard Ammons as a nature poet, it’s because I prefer him when he is talking about other things. Moping about his career, for example, he wrote in 1967:

what I need I mean is a champion or even a host of champions,

a phalanx of enthusiasts, driving a spearhead

or one or two of those big amphibian trucks

through the peopled ocean of my neglect:

I mean I don’t want to sound fancy but

what I could use at the moment is

a little destruction perpetrated in my favor.

He had a way, when the dew grew too thick on the leaves of his verse, of breaking into rude song:

Baby, you been stomping round on my toes so long

They’re breaking out in black and blue hyacinths,

Well-knit forget-me-nots

Geraniums are flopping out over the tops of my shoes

tendril leaves coming out along the edges of my shoelaces.

Ammons wrote often about sex, too, its own form of dancing:

swing!

your partner,

promenade (and when

you can

get laid

get laid)

Ammons sat down at his desk every day and wrote whether he had anything to say or not. Because of this, he wrote more guff than most important American poets. There is a not always pleasant sense of him working things out in real time.

He knew he could strain a reader’s patience. Please turn in your hymnals, he wrote, to page “Archie carrying on again.” He once referred to his career as “50 years of yapping.”

Ammons carries you along because as he vamps, like a musician, there’s a sense of drama, of his mind expanding and contracting. He will hit his groove and deliver a string of intensities. Then he will pull back because the beauty is too much; he’ll wait for the next moment to strike.

Is it O.K. to love a poet because he writes well about napping?

half an hour is great: an hour exactly twice as good, and all day

practically incalculable: but judge not me as you must not others:

some of the drowsy-looking people you see have had so much food, sex,

and sleep that the only sign of life on them is a tiny smile of dumb bliss.

His charm was so great you only slowly realize how much loneliness and anger and depression swam behind his verse. He wrote: “Some mornings, I don’t know whether / to discharge a gun or an obligation.”

Ammons hoped that the point in his poetry would be “delivered below / the level of argument, straight into the fat / of feeling.” He got there more than most poets of his time.

Ammons could be high-minded but he had few pretentious bones in his body. He told us what he wanted and, like Babe Ruth pointing at the bleachers, he delivered:",Adding Up a Prolific Poet’s Charming Weather Reports,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/books/review-a-r-ammons-complete-poems.html

There have already been signs of Mr. Putin’s influence starting to ebb, however, and a few brutish spats among the elite have spilled into the open.","This jockeying for power is expected to offer all the drama that next year’s presidential race sorely lacks. Cloistered, for now, mostly behind the Kremlin walls, the intrigues are expected to burst into public view with increasing frequency in coming years.

Several internal battles have already erupted publicly, including the dismantling of a respected research university and a startling corruption trial in which a former minister accused of soliciting bribes said he was set up by a former spy who has been a close Putin ally. It is the kind of fight the president would have managed privately in previous years.

“You cannot hide the enormous tension, the enormous degree of uncertainty within the Russian elite,” said Konstantin Gaaze, who contributes political analysis to the website of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a policy research organization. “They will do stupid things; they will blackmail each other; they will write reports about each other and bring them to Putin.”

For the coming three months, the election will be the main distraction. Then Mr. Putin, who will turn 72 in 2024, is expected to start building something of a retirement plan.

In the view of some analysts, the president believes that trying to retain the job for life would be a mistake. One day, if he stays too long, he could be hastily deposed — like the recent experience of President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe after 37 years in office.

“Putin thinks of himself as an historical figure, and he knows that if he wants to put himself into the history books, he should not repeat Mugabe’s mistake — he should find the right time to leave,” said Konstantin Kalachyov, the head of the Political Expert Group and an occasional consultant for the Kremlin.

At the same time, Mr. Putin is likely to want to preserve some political role after 2024 and not simply retire to his dacha, or worse, end up in jail.

“He cannot just go,” Mr. Gaaze said. “He knows perfectly well that if his successor fails, they will both be prosecuted.”

Some expect Mr. Putin to reshape the Constitution to create some kind of higher military or security council, appointing himself to lead it and securing his influence. “I cannot imagine a situation where he gives all power to the successor; he does not trust anybody,” Mr. Gaaze said.

Mr. Putin has done something similar before. When his second consecutive term as president ended in 2008, he served as prime minister during the one-term presidency of Dmitri A. Medvedev, although it was understood he remained the country’s ultimate leader. Starting with the election of 2012, the president’s term in office was extended from four years to six.

Mr. Pavlovsky, who worked in the Kremlin under President Boris N. Yeltsin, recalled that the process to replace Mr. Yeltsin, who was ailing, began right after he won the 1996 election and would clearly not run again.

It meant rebuilding the state, not just replacing the man.

“We knew that Yeltsin would be gone in 2000, and we did not want the state to go with him,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “It was Yeltsin’s Russia. Yeltsin was going, so Yeltsin’s Russia was going too, and we had to found a new Russia.”

Mr. Yeltsin appointed Mr. Putin his successor in 2000, and he has been the most powerful man in Russia ever since. Because Mr. Putin has centralized so much power, the question of who will succeed him is especially urgent.

“Today we have Putin’s Russia,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “If Putin is gone, Putin’s Russia also has to go. That is also a dangerous situation. His entourage understands this and wants to preserve Putin’s Russia after he is gone.”

So the various factions within the Putin Court will seek to convince the president to name an heir apparent who best preserves their collective interests.

For those angling to succeed the president, it is a high-wire act. Candidates need to be careful not to be seen as an immediate threat to the president, notoriously protective of his position. Push too hard, too fast, and a person could be purged.

Photo

And as 2024 nears, Mr. Putin’s ability to protect likely successors could lessen, putting them at risk of being brought down by rivals. As a result, no one is expected to seek the heir apparent title openly.

“People considered possible successors are ready to pay not to be called that,” Mr. Kalachyov said.

The Kremlin dismissed talk of internal intrigues, with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, calling such speculation the favorite pastime of political analysts. “That is what they do,” he said.

There have already been signs of Mr. Putin’s influence starting to ebb, however, and a few brutish spats among the elite have spilled into the open.

Russia’s former economy minister, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, delivered a long, emotional soliloquy at the closing of his corruption trial on Thursday about what he views as political treachery.

He faces up to 10 years in a penal colony on charges of soliciting a $2 million bribe to approve a major oil deal sought by the state oil giant Rosneft, run by Igor I. Sechin, a Putin ally and former military intelligence agent.

Mr. Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty, accusing Mr. Sechin of setting up a cloak-and-dagger sting operation by proffering a gift of fine wine and homemade sausages to disguise a brown leather satchel brimming with dollars.

In his speech, the former minister warned the Kremlin elite that anyone could be next in the docket. “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee,” he said, quoting the classic lines of John Donne. “It can toll for any one of you. It’s become very easy: a bag, a basket, a grainy video, three clicks, and it’s ready.”

In a show of force, Mr. Sechin refused a court summons to appear as a witness at the trial four times, saying he was too busy.

Aside from Mr. Ulyukayev, Mr. Sechin appears intent on crushing Sistema, a wealthy investment firm, by filing repeated lawsuits — despite public admonitions from Mr. Putin that he would like such disputes settled amicably.

Mr. Sechin also publicly, and unexpectedly, pledged to work with Ramzan Kadyrov, the autocratic leader of Chechnya. Both men have shown an increasing tendency to act independently of Mr. Putin, distancing themselves even though it was the president’s protection that allowed both to become outsize figures with vast fortunes and personal fiefs.

If Mr. Sechin and Mr. Kadyrov share a common cause, it is trying to help choose the next president, the best insurance for those in the inner circle. “Because the others, except those who decide the successor to Putin, will all be in great danger,” Mr. Pavlovsky said.

The more Mr. Putin becomes a lame duck, analysts said, the less influence he may have in choosing a successor and the more Kremlin insiders will assert themselves. Many point to the case of the European University at St. Petersburg as an example that Mr. Putin’s protection is no longer as robust.

By numerous accounts, Mr. Putin tried to preserve the university, a respected private, liberal, postgraduate institution. Conservative nationalists hated it, and real estate developers coveted the historic Small Marble Palace where it was housed.

First the university lost its building, and last week it was denied an operating license for the third time. The demise came despite what one senior university official and various Russian news reports described as three attempts by Mr. Putin to get the Education Ministry to protect the place.

“What matters now is your own potential independent of Putin,” Mr. Pavlovsky said, “because the moment is rapidly approaching when Putin will not be able to help you.”",Putin’s Re-election Is Assured.

In January, federal wildlife officials issued a report that called climate change the biggest threat to the survival of the polar bear.

Polar bears depend on sea ice as a platform for hunting seals. As the planet warms, that ice cover melts earlier and earlier, limiting the amount of time polar bears have to hunt and build up their fat reserves before moving to land. As a result, they can end up skinny and in poor physical health by the end of long ice-free summers.

Biologists agree that as ice cover continues to decrease, there will be a significant drop in the polar bear population, which according to federal wildlife officials stands at about 26,000 globally. A 2015 assessment projected a reduction of over 30 percent in the number of polar bears by 2050.

“Polar bears are built for a feast-or-famine type of eating,” said Elisabeth Kruger, an arctic wildlife program officer with the World Wildlife Fund. “But when that period of fasting gets too long, it can put them on the brink.”

Polar bears have been labeled threatened under the Endangered Species Act act since 2008. They are among the largest members of the bear species and prey heavily on seals.

All of which makes the viral images of a fur-and-bones polar bear particularly striking. The bear Mr. Nicklen and his team documented was stuck on land, its muscles atrophied by continuing starvation, and apparently on the edge of death.

One would have to do “a lot of specific investigating” to determine the cause of suffering for a particular polar bear, Ms. Kruger said, but what is captured in Mr. Nicklen’s photo “is one of the ways polar bears die.”

Most of the feedback Mr. Nicklen has received on social media appears positive, if twined with sadness. (The viral video of the polar bear, he noted, has been slowed from normal speed.) But he has also received blowback from some who have complained he did not do enough to help.

“People assume you’re just coldhearted,” he said. “Of course we’re upset.” But feeding the polar bear would not only prolong its misery, he said, it would have been illegal. And “for me to take a gun up to that polar bear and kill it, now you’re looking at jail.”

This is not the first time a downtrodden polar bear has captured the hearts of humans. After all, they are “incredibly charismatic,” Ms. Kruger said, and “big, white, fluffy creatures.”

Last year, a polar bear named Pizza garnered the support of millions of people worldwide when animal welfare advocates began a campaign to move “the world’s saddest polar bear,” as he was known, from a mall in southern China, where the bear lived in a glass enclosure.

Mr. Nicklen said the polar bear he and his team found was never given a cute human name.

Several high-profile television anchors have been fired from their jobs after being accused of inappropriate touching, exposing themselves or assaulting women in the workplace.

Allegations of sexual assault against Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, have roiled the special election in that state, where voting is to take place on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s decision to endorse Mr. Moore despite accusations that the Senate candidate once fondled a 14-year-old girl, has highlighted the president’s own accusations.

On Monday, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, added her name to a short list of Democratic lawmakers who have called on Mr. Trump to resign because of the sexual misconduct accusations lodged against him.

“President Trump has committed assault, according to these women,” Ms. Gillibrand said Monday afternoon on CNN. “And those are very credible allegations of misconduct and criminal activity, and he should be fully investigated and he should resign.” She echoed the comments of the women, saying that Congress should investigate.

Whether the president will hold himself accountable “is something you really can’t hold your breath for, so Congress should have hearings,” Ms. Gillibrand said.

This month, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, called on the president to step down because of a track record of “horrific conduct” with women. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said on Sunday that the president “has been accused by many women of assault” and urged him to consider resigning the way that Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, agreed to do after multiple allegations of inappropriate behavior. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, told Vice News on Sunday that the accusations by the women against Mr. Trump were “far more damning.”

White House officials on Monday repeated the president’s claim that the accusations of sexual misconduct were false and that the women were lying.

“The president has directly responded and said that these allegations are false and that’s what I’m doing in relaying that information to you,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters. Asked whether Congress should investigate, Ms. Sanders noted that voters had already made a judgment about the allegations.

“This took place long before he was elected to be president,” Ms. Sanders said. “And the people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump, and we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.”

The women accusing the president originally came forward, along with several others, in October 2016 after reports emerged of Mr. Trump talking crudely on an “Access Hollywood” recording. Mr. Trump admitted to making the comments on the tape, and apologized for them, but he vehemently denied the allegations of misconduct and harassment by the other women.

After Mr. Trump’s victory on Election Day, interest waned in the allegations. Several of the women said on Monday that they were angry that their decision to tell their stories did not initially seem to be taken seriously.

“It was heartbreaking last year,” Ms. Holvey said on the NBC program. “We are private citizens and for us to put ourselves out there, to try to show America who this man is, and especially how he views women, for them to say, ‘Meh, we don’t care,’ it hurt.”

It remains to be seen whether the women will now be treated differently. Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and a prominent woman in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, broke with White House talking points on Sunday when she said that the president’s accusers “should be heard” and should feel free to come forward — even though the election was over.

“I know that he was elected,” Ms. Haley said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”

At the White House, Ms. Sanders responded to a question about Ms. Haley’s comments by saying that the president agreed — in generic terms — that “it’s a good thing that women are coming forward” to tell their stories about harassment.

But she said that “he also feels strongly that a mere allegation shouldn’t determine the course,” and she repeated Mr. Trump’s belief that his victory in the election should be the end of the story.

(Mr. Moore said late Monday that he had taken his wife to West Point to see their son.)","And so with turnout the biggest riddle, both Mr. Jones and Mr. Moore scrambled Monday to shore up support where they could. After dark, Mr. Moore rallied supporters in this rural area of southeast Alabama, a near-certain trove of Republican votes. Mr. Jones, who spent his weekend appearing with prominent black Democrats, campaigned in Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama’s two most populous cities, to try to energize urban and African-American voters who would be central to a Democratic victory.

Mr. Jones, a former United States attorney who also needs support from independent and Republican voters if he is to win on Tuesday, tried to balance his get-out-the-vote appeals to Democrats with outreach to people who ordinarily would not consider voting for a Democrat. Indeed, it seemed his most powerful weapon was a Republican: Senator Richard C. Shelby, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, who, in an interview on CNN on Sunday, denounced Mr. Moore and declared that Alabama “deserves better.”

“The people of the state, they have elected Richard Shelby for four decades,” Mr. Jones said of the senator, who has said he wrote in “a distinguished Republican” rather than vote for Mr. Moore. “They’re going to listen to Richard Shelby.”

Mr. Jones also earned an implicit boost, of a sort, from Condoleezza Rice, the Republican former secretary of state and an Alabama native. In a statement issued by her office on Monday afternoon, Ms. Rice called on Alabamians to “reject bigotry, sexism and intolerance” and “insist that our representatives are dignified, decent and respectful of the values we hold dear.”

Photo

While Ms. Rice did not mention either candidate by name, and it is unclear how widely her statement will be seen before Election Day, she joined Mr. Shelby in giving a permission slip to wavering Republicans who may be tempted to vote for someone other than a nominee they find intolerable. Some Republicans, echoing Mr. Shelby, have written-in other figures, and a liberal “super PAC,” hoping to starve Mr. Moore of Republican voters who are skeptical of both candidates, has urged write-in votes for Nick Saban, the University of Alabama’s head football coach.

That Mr. Jones is even in a position to benefit from a make-or-break turnout effort is extraordinary by the standards of Alabama, where no Democrat has won an election for Senate or governor in almost 20 years and the party’s statewide infrastructure has crumbled and all but collapsed. A Fox News poll published on Monday found Mr. Jones with a 10-point lead over Mr. Moore, but other recent surveys have found Mr. Moore ahead, and private Democratic polling shows a closer race than the Fox poll suggested.

The campaign’s basic mathematics are widely agreed upon: If Mr. Jones can attract the votes of young people and African-Americans, and peel away a chunk of Republican-leaning whites — particularly women — who recoil from Mr. Moore, then he has a chance to win. Otherwise, the state’s conservative D.N.A. is all but certain to kick in and rescue Mr. Moore from tribulations of his own making.

Mr. Moore, who has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, has been a surprisingly rare sight in public as the campaign nears its end. But he re-emerged at a chandelier-adorned, barnlike building here Monday night in his first public appearance since last Tuesday. The event in Dale County was safe political ground for Mr. Moore, who won 66 percent of the county’s vote in his last statewide general election.

At a rally that featured three conservative firebrands — Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser; David Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis.; and Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas — Mr. Moore’s supporters urged voters to show up on Tuesday.

“This comes down simply to who is going to work the hardest,” Mr. Bannon said at the rally, which, at varying points, included the theme music to “Mission Impossible” and boos at the mention of Mr. Shelby’s name.

Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, later made an emotional appeal on her husband’s behalf, mounting a sustained assault on what she called “fake news” and trying to immunize Mr. Moore from attacks that he disliked women in positions of power, black people and Jewish people.

“One of our attorneys is a Jew,” she said. “We have very close friends that are Jewish and rabbis, and we also fellowship with them.”

Along a road near the event site, protesters gathered to demonstrate against Mr. Moore. Some held signs supporting Mr. Jones, and another placard read: “Real Christians Aren’t Bigots.”

Rural and reliably Republican pockets of east Alabama, like Dale County, could prove to be Mr. Moore’s political salvation. Along a stretch of U.S. Route 431 between Phenix City and Dothan on Monday, signs promoting Mr. Moore were common. Advertisements for Mr. Jones, whose signs fill yards in places like Birmingham and Gadsden, were rare.

Mr. Jones’s strategy does not depend on carrying rural counties that hug Georgia and Florida. Instead, he is hoping to run up significant leads in Alabama’s urban and suburban areas, drawing on traditional Democratic voters as well as Republicans spooked by the allegations against Mr. Moore or a controversial record that predates the Senate campaign.

Speaking briefly at an event space attached to a vintage car showroom in Birmingham, flanked by the basketball star Charles Barkley, Mr. Jones cast the vote as a choice that would define Alabama’s identity.

“It is time that we put our decency, our state, before political party,” Mr. Jones said. Mr. Barkley was more blunt: “At some point, we’ve got to stop looking like idiots to the nation.”

Although Mr. Jones is running against the tides of recent political history in Alabama, Mr. Moore is a deeply divisive figure in the state, where he was, in effect, twice removed as chief justice of the State Supreme Court.

He has a base of supporters whose fervor is the envy of Democrats, as well as plenty of Republicans who have hoped to vanquish him over the years. But should Mr. Moore prevail on Tuesday, he will likely have Mr. Trump, in part, to thank. The president did not visit Alabama after Mr. Moore won the Republican nomination in September, but he repeatedly took to Twitter in support of Mr. Moore and recorded an automated phone message that went out to Republican voters. (For his part, Mr. Jones dispatched automated phone calls from former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.)

Mr. Trump provided Mr. Moore with a crucial seal of approval at a moment of crisis for his campaign, effectively offering reassurance to Republicans who were uneasy about Mr. Moore’s scandals that it was acceptable to vote for him. At a rally last Friday just over the border in Florida, Mr. Trump hailed Mr. Moore as critical to enacting a “‘Make America Great Again’ agenda” in the Senate.

But Mr. Moore’s campaign has been unable to move past the allegations that made the race a close one, and the candidate himself has not made much of a public effort to deliver a pointed closing message.

On Monday morning, Mr. Jones ridiculed Mr. Moore for effectively going underground at the most intense moment in the race. He mockingly alluded to reports that Mr. Moore attended the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia. (Mr. Moore said late Monday that he had taken his wife to West Point to see their son.)

“Here I am once again, surrounded by this gaggle, which I’ve come to love and enjoy, while Roy Moore was not even in the state of Alabama over this weekend,” Mr. Jones said, adding, “When is the last time you’ve heard of a candidate for statewide office leave the state?”","Alabama Senate Race, Unlikely Nail-Biter, Races to Finish Line",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/alabama-roy-moore-doug-jones.html

Breakingviews’ Lauren Silva Laughlin argues that Xerox has few options to right itself and might do better “realigning itself inside a larger firm, or finding a buyer to take it private.”

“Corporate actions taken by Xerox, though commendable, are no match for the ravages of the digital world. Selling the company may be the logical next move.”

It’s a deal that seemed destined to happen: Shazam-Apple.

Apple confirmed Monday that it has reached a deal to buy Shazam, the maker of an app that identifies songs after listening to just a few seconds of them.

Apple did not disclose the price tag on the deal, but The New York Times reported Friday that it was expected to be far less than the $1 billion that Shazam was valued at in its most recent fund-raising round in 2015.

In 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses.

Shazam’s technology was introduced in 2002 as a dial-up service that would listen to a song for 30 seconds and send its user a text message identifying it. It eventually became one of the most popular mobile apps on Apple’s App Store. Last year, the company said that it had surpassed a billion mobile downloads and was used by “hundreds of millions of people each month.”

For Apple, the deal is all about Siri, writes VentureBeat’s Emil Protalinski:

Apple likely wants Siri to do what both Amazon and Google are working on: help the user figure out the world around them, and also sell them content. Siri should be able to extract valuable information for the user from what it hears and what it sees. It could also then let you add that song to your Apple Music playlist, watch the trailer, or even buy the movie on iTunes, and so on. That’s much easier to achieve once Siri has swallowed Shazam.

Paul Pendergass, formerly DealBook’s “Jack Flack” columnist, offers up his unique take on the deal:

Is Elliott a headache for Qualcomm — or a useful tool?

In arguing that NXP Semiconductors is worth $135 per share — on an independent basis, and therefore leaving aside Qualcomm’s takeover bid — the activist hedge fund is threatening to add more to Broadcom’s hostile acquisition campaign for Qualcomm.

Elliott argued in a presentation this morning that the market hasn’t appreciated how much of a revival NXP’s business has enjoyed, particularly now that it has fully processed its acquisition of fellow chip maker Freescale Semiconductor. And Qualcomm’s $110-a-share bid is currently acting as a cap on how much higher the stock can go.

From the activist's letter to other shareholders:

“While NXP’s operating performance has fully bounced back over the past year, its stock price has not – again, likely due to, in our view, the ceiling created by Qualcomm’s low priced offer.”

The bigger picture: Qualcomm has been fighting off Broadcom’s $105 billion takeover offer. But Broadcom said that its current bid is contingent in part on the NXP transaction being completed at the original level of $110 a share. Analysts and investors have speculated that, by paying more for NXP, Qualcomm could effectively persuade Broadcom to walk away — though some also have suggested that Elliott’s move could be a useful way to persuade Broadcom to raise its price.

Where things stand: Qualcomm is currently in the middle of a tender offer for NXP shares. A small fraction of NXP shareholders have currently agreed to accept the bid, with many waiting until the end of the offer period. At the moment, the earliest that Qualcomm’s tender could wrap up is middle-to-late January.

The Qualcomm response

For now, the chip maker said that it disagrees with Elliott’s analysis. Its statement:

“Elliott’s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda. We remain fully committed to closing the acquisition of NXP and believe that the agreed-upon price of $110 is full and fair.”

Bitcoin mania now extends to futures trading.

Cboe’s recently introduced futures proved so popular that the Chicago exchange’s website went down amid overwhelming traffic and circuit breakers were triggered — twice.

As of this morning, Bitcoin futures hit $17,540, from an open of $15,000.

“It is rare that you see something more volatile than bitcoin, but we found it: Bitcoin futures,” Zennon Kapron, managing director of the Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia, told Bloomberg.

Why the frenzy? Futures are the first way that investors can bet on the direction of Bitcoin without having to buy the digital currency.

Mario Batali is the latest to face misconduct accusations.

He has stepped away from day-to-day operations of his food empire, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group in the wake of an Eater story in which four women described what they said were incidents of unwanted groping and sexual harassment.

From the article by Irene Plagianos and Kitty Greenwald:

Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses.

As recently as October, one of his employees had reported inappropriate behavior by the celebrity chef to human resources, according to Eater.

Mr. Batali is the best-known restaurateur to date to face misconduct allegations amid a sweeping wave of accusations against powerful men. (Another well-known chef, John Besh, stepped down in October after the publication of a lengthy investigation by the Times-Picayune of New Orleans.)

How the Republican tax plan tilted toward corporations.

When President Trump lays out on Wednesday how he sees the tax overhaul benefiting the middle class — as reported by Axios — his argument runs counter to how the legislation has actually evolved.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Damian Paletta of the WaPo has outlined the transformation of the tax plan and how it began to emphasize issues like a $1 trillion cut for businesses while scaling back tax cuts for middle-class families. From his piece:

“Fundamentally, the bill has been mislabeled. From a truth-in-advertising standpoint, it would have been a lot simpler if we just acknowledged reality on this bill, which is it’s fundamentally a corporate tax reduction and restructuring bill, period,” said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.).

Speed kills?

One thing that lawmakers are trying to fix, according to Richard Rubin of the WSJ:

Some high-income business owners could face marginal tax rates exceeding 100 percent under the Senate’s tax bill, far beyond the listed rates in the Republican plan. That means a business owner’s next $100 in earnings, under certain circumstances, would require paying more than $100 in additional federal and state taxes.

More on the hits to New York: Wall Street is still lobbying against the current version of the bill, particularly on issues like limits to deductions for state and local taxes. “Over time this will be a major blow to keeping New York City the world’s undisputed financial capital,” Paul Taubman of PJT Partners told the FT.

If you want to understand Alabama and Roy Moore, read this.

This Op-Ed by the former NYT executive editor Howell Raines, an Alabama native, is worth noting as the state’s residents head to the polls tomorrow. At stake: whether the Republicans’ already-slim majority shrinks to just one seat.

From Mr. Raines’s piece:

Mr. Bishop, a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, said he had drifted over to the Democrats when Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal paid him and his jobless friends to work on the kind of infrastructure projects promised by candidate Trump. But he sees modern Democrats as detached from common folk. He’ll vote for Mr. Moore and intends to “sway” his wife from her plan to support Mr. Jones.

As the Trump administration closes in on its one-year anniversary, expect more officials to make their exits. Ms. Powell’s move is notable in that she is leaving on good terms with Mr. Trump, according to the WaPo.

Who else is on deck?

• Rex Tillerson could leave as secretary of state in February, according to Politico.

The net neutrality fight comes to a head this week.

The F.C.C. is scheduled to vote on Thursday on its proposal to roll back regulations. Expect protesters to keep up demonstrations against the move. “We want members of Congress to think of this as a third-rail issue that they have to support or else they will suffer in their elections,” Craig Aaron of the advocacy group Free Press told the NYT.

In the F.C.C.’s corner

Roger Stone, one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent advisers. From his op-ed in The Daily Caller:

But since the giant edge providers — companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter — are content providers, they are exempt from “Net Neutrality” rules, free to restrain content by censoring out all conservative and libertarian views at will, without so much as an explanation to anyone why the objectionable views were banned.

Across the pond: Strong competition and regulation have generally prevented bad behavior from internet service providers in Europe — but telecommunications companies have managed to push boundaries in other ways, the NYT reports.

The Fed is likely to raise interest rates this week. What’s next?

Economists are starting to believe that the Fed may have to raise rates more quickly than expected after its meeting — the last to be chaired by Janet Yellen — on Wednesday. Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT lays out many of the factors that Jerome Powell and the Fed will have to weigh, including strong economic growth and sluggish inflation.

Economists at Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase predict that interest rates across advanced economies will rise by at least 1 percent next year, in what Bloomberg says would be the biggest jump since 2006.

A lament for Ms. Yellen’s one term

From Amy Chozick’s article in the NYT on the departing Fed chair:

“Janet should’ve been renominated, as every past Fed chair has been renominated for nearly the last 40 years,” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview. “But it’s not the first time and certainly not the last a highly qualified woman is passed over for a job she clearly deserves.”

“Rational exuberance is the stock market’s theme for 2018.”

That’s the prediction that David Kostin, the chief U.S. equity strategist, gave Barron’s for its look at what next year holds for the markets. The publication surveyed 10 strategists at major financial firms. Among the consensus predictions: a 7 percent gain in the S.&P. 500.

But Barron’s also offers some caveats:

The outlook isn’t entirely rosy: Interest rates are headed higher, stocks are expensive, and a tax overhaul could still stall or fail. But so long as corporate earnings keep climbing and the Federal Reserve raises rates in a measured way, the strategists see more room for gains.

Extra credit: Mr. Trump’s overall approval ratings may be low, but Americans surveyed by the WSJ and NBC News in late October gave the president a 42 percent approval rating for his handling of the economy. (WSJ)

How would a Fox-Disney deal remake Hollywood?

First, a status update: The two companies are still in advanced negotiations, and a transaction could be announced this week. The standard caveats of deal reporting, including that the talks could still fall apart, apply here.

If Disney succeeds in buying Fox, it would upend the decades-old status quo of the Hollywood movie system. But what happens with the 20th Century Fox movie studio is still in flux, according to Ben Fritz of the WSJ:

Some people close to the deal talks said 20th Century Fox could become a production label within the Walt Disney Studios, akin to Pixar and Marvel. In that scenario, Fox operations such as theatrical and home-video distribution would likely be cut back, resulting in job losses among the studio’s approximately 3,200 employees.

A serial acquirer is in trouble after accounting issues.

Shares in Steinhoff International, a retailer that went on a debt-heavy buying spree in recent years, plunged 84 percent (wiping out nearly $12 billion in market value) over the past week after the company disclosed potential accounting irregularities. The company has hired Moelis & Company and Alixpartners to help with “liquidity management and operational measures.”

The bigger picture

David Fickling of Gadfly writes that there’s a lesson here for other inveterate corporate deal makers — notably HNA of China. From his piece:

There’s a simple reason that few companies spend long on the sort of shopping spree that Steinhoff and HNA followed in recent years: Takeovers tend to destroy shareholder value.

The Golden Globe nominations came out this morning, and on the TV side, it was business as usual — which for the Globes means some snazzy out-there choices, predictably unpredictable. The Emmys remain TV’s main award, while the Golden Globes are more of a fun side project. And sometimes, they really are a lot of fun.

[Golden Globes Updates | Movie Surprises and Snubs | Nominees List]

Snub: ‘The Good Place’

Nothing for “The Good Place” at all; not a best-comedy nod, not for Ted Danson, not for Kristen Bell, not for D’Arcy Carden. Maybe at the Emmys? The show is so joyously clever and surprising, in an era where many other network comedies are cynical, predictable or just dreadful. “The Good Place” is one of the brightest spots on TV right now, nimbly both highbrow and lowbrow. Give it an award!

Surprise: ‘SMILF’

The Golden Globes love a new comedy, but Showtime’s “SMILF” is still an out-there choice. The show, created by and starring Frankie Shaw — also nominated, in the comedy series lead actress category — follows a single mother in Boston who is barely making ends meet. (It’s interesting, if not always fully hatched.)

Snubs: Comedies

This is a quintessential Golden Globes slate. In recent years, the Globes have fallen hard for Amazon shows, with “Transparent” and “Mozart in the Jungle,” so “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” isn’t out of left field. “black-ish” was nominated last year, and “Master of None” earned Aziz Ansari a nomination in 2016, too. “SMILF” is the wild card — there’s often a wild card — and “Will & Grace”? “Will & Grace” was nominated for 27 Golden Globes during its initial run. (It went 0–27, somehow.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Left out, though, are last year’s nominees “Transparent” and “Veep.” “Better Things,” “Glow” and “Insecure” all earned acting nominations for their female leads, but not best comedy nods. “Girls,” which won in 2012 and was nominated twice more, didn’t make it, nor did previous winner “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.”

Surprise: ‘The Sinner’

USA’s murder-mystery mini-series did well ratings-wise, but this is a competitive category: “The Sinner” edged out “Twin Peaks: The Return,” “American Horror Story: Cult” and the Emmy nominees “American Crime” and “Genius.”

Snubs: Dramas

This is almost the same drama lineup as last year’s nominees, with “Westworld” swapped out for “The Handmaid’s Tale.” And the truth is it’s not a bad list of contenders: “The Crown,” “Game of Thrones,” “Handmaid,” “Stranger Things” and “This Is Us” is a perfectly serviceable selection.",The TV Surprises and Snubs of the 2018 Golden Globes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/arts/television/golden-globes-snubs-surprises.html

In the game, a DESTROYER has two units (or X’s when they’ve been HIT), so the answer we write in is CONAN THE XX.

I stared at that for a long time before I realized that the answer wasn’t 2X or TWENTY. In fact, I had to solve all the way down to the BATTLESHIP revealer at 60A — “It’s four units long in a popular board game (with the game’s other pieces hinted at by the circled letters)” — before I understood what I was aiming for, so to speak. Once I realized that all the circled squares needed X’s, it made the solve much easier.

One other thing I liked about this puzzle was the skill Mr. Charlson showed in filling his grid. Trying to fill cleanly around all of those X’s (especially with them being so close together) is not for the faint of heart. I think he succeeded, don’t you?

Kudos to Mr. Charlson for a fun take on this board game, and for debuting SUBMARINE SANDWICH. And kudos to the editors for the “Grinder” clue.

Tricky Clues

25A: I loved this clue. “Early form of airmail?” had me searching my brain, but I eventually came up with CARRIER PIGEON. Of course, there’s always the African swallow:

42A: “Butters up?” is also a term for flattering someone, but today — given our recent American Thanksgiving — we are supposed to be thinking about the word BASTES.

9D: He’s not wrong. “Congress” and SEX are synonyms. And I will leave it at that.

13D: Remember, it’s Thursday, so if you are thinking that a clue might mean one thing and none of your answers fit, try thinking about whether the clue could have a different meaning. “Giving heat?” could mean pressuring someone or coming down hard on them, but with that question mark, we are thinking of “heat” as slang for a weapon. That’s why the answer is ARMING.

Constructor Notes

The core concept behind today’s puzzle has been seen before, but I wondered if there was a new spin I could put on the idea. Perhaps, I thought, the squares themselves, rather than a letter sequence, could replace the word they represent. Still, this was just a thought — I couldn’t believe my luck when I discovered not only that DESTROYER, CRUISER, SUBMARINE and CARRIER could all be incorporated into lively, nonnautical-related entries, but also that along with BATTLESHIP as a revealer, these entries could be arranged symmetrically when their respective boat names were replaced with the number of squares corresponding to the boat’s length in Battleship! I briefly considered placing a HIT rebus in each of these squares, but decided on X’s to represent hits instead, figuring that I could only push my luck so far, and it doesn’t hurt that I have a soft spot for the high value Scrabble letters. In designing and filling the grid, I started with the upper region, deploying my black squares to best accommodate the seven X’s. Again, to my surprise, I got far better fill here than I expected — I’d like to give a shout-out to Pope JOHN X for his much-needed assistance. Interestingly enough, the bottom right was the toughest section to fill cleanly, despite the lack of X’s. Overall, though, I think this turned out pretty well, and am glad I could incorporate some long bonus fill like “JUKEBOX HERO” and LOOSE CANNON, and some nice mid-length fill in LIKE SO and ROOMBA. I was pleased to see that my favorite clue of mine, “Early form of airmail?” for CARRIER PIGEON, made the cut, and I like the opacity of Will and Joel’s clue “Grinder” for SUBMARINE SANDWICH. Given its proximity to 17-Across, I thought it might be fun to clue BOOR as “Barbarian,” but that didn’t end up making it into the final version. Finally, a note on circles. Although I wonder if the circled squares might give away the game a bit too easily for some, if they allow a mind-bending theme like this one to become accessible to more solvers, then I think they’re a good thing. On that note, I hope everyone enjoys the puzzle!

NEW ORLEANS — How is a little Pacific island like the planet Mars?

Let James Garvin count the ways.

In December 2014, an underwater volcano amid the islands of Tonga in the South Pacific erupted. When the eruption ended and ashes settled a month later, a new island had emerged, rising 400 feet above the ocean’s surface.

Scientists unofficially named the island Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai, a concatenation of two older, uninhabited islands it nestles between.

Since then, scientists have been tracking how the new land mass has eroded and shifted. What they have found could make the island a Rosetta Stone to understanding volcanic features on Mars that also appear to have erupted underwater, providing clues about when the red planet was wet several billion years ago.

“We see things that remind us of this kind of volcano at similar scales on Mars,” said Dr. Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “And literally, there are thousands of them, in multiple regions.”

Wynn, the hedge fund kingpin Steven A. Cohen or the media mogul David Geffen?

The news was something of an anticlimax for the art world, given that Prince Bader is unknown.
At Art Basel Miami Beach this week, people swarming the booths of contemporary art barely remarked on the revelation.
But the bar-setting price of the Leonardo has the art world wondering whether we will see a billion-dollar painting before too long.","That widened the list of usual suspects. Could it have been a trophy hunt for a major contemporary art collector, like the casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn, the hedge fund kingpin Steven A. Cohen or the media mogul David Geffen? Or might a wealthy collector have acquired the painting on behalf of a museum, like Ken Griffin for the Art Institute of Chicago?

Maybe the Qataris bought it for one of their museums — having paid among the highest prices for art in recent history, including $250 million for Cézanne’s “Card Players” in 2011?

As I moved on to reporting other stories, I kept raising the question of the buyer in my conversations with auction specialists, museum curators, art advisers, collectors and dealers. Everyone had their theories.

Clues, some argued, lay in the body language of who had done the bidding. Alex Rotter, Christie’s co-chairman of postwar and contemporary art for the Americas, represented the winning buyer on the phone and looked surprisingly relaxed during the 19-minute sale despite its nail-biting stakes. This suggested that Mr. Rotter was speaking with someone with whom he felt comfortable — a longtime collector client or an art adviser he had done business with for years.

The specialist representing the underbidder, Francois de Poortere, Christie’s head of old master paintings, on the other hand, was less visible to the spectators and had a specialist in Asian art standing behind him, which led many to speculate that he was representing Liu Yiqian, a former taxi driver turned billionaire art collector, who purchased a nude by Amedeo Modigliani at Christie’s for $170.4 million in 2015. I asked my colleague Amy Qin to check with Mr. Liu; he denied being the underbidder.

In the end, the buyer was someone from left field, a little-known Saudi prince who appears to have never before purchased a major artwork, as my colleague David Kirkpatrick learned from documents this week. The prince, Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, will be lending — or donating? — the painting to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, which just opened in a new building designed by Jean Nouvel. Since then conflicting reports have emerged about whether the true buyer was Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia or if Prince Bader acted as an agent for the ministry of culture of Abu Dhabi.

The news was something of an anticlimax for the art world, given that Prince Bader is unknown. At Art Basel Miami Beach this week, people swarming the booths of contemporary art barely remarked on the revelation.

But the bar-setting price of the Leonardo has the art world wondering whether we will see a billion-dollar painting before too long. And the auction did have a residual impact, experts say, attesting to the bullishness of the market and making works at a fair like Miami’s — most of which are priced below $5 million — seem like a bargain by comparison.

5. When the Islamic State seized territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014, it had the time and space to manufacture weapons on an industrial scale. We obtained extensive documents that show how the group built up its output levels “unlike anything we’ve ever seen” from a nonstate force.

At times the weapons were exceptionally cruel — booby-traps that blew up homes, heaters packed with explosives. Above, an area of Mosul recently recaptured from the group.

Jessica Chastain received news of her Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a dramatic feature while promoting that film, “Molly’s Game,” in Paris. Directed by Aaron Sorkin, the film tells the true story of Molly Bloom, a world-class skier who began running high-stakes, celebrity-magnet poker games. Speaking by phone shortly before she was due to fly to Amsterdam, Ms. Chastain said the Globe nomination was especially gratifying because she had been outspoken about recent sexual harassment accusations and had worried that she would face industry repercussions.

This is your fifth Golden Globe nomination. Do you feel like an old hand?

Not at all. The first, I think, was for the ceremony in 2012, for “The Help.” I struggled for so long to try to create a career. To have five nominations in such a short amount of time, it’s really shocking, and more than I ever imagined. I just feel so much gratitude and happiness.

“Molly’s Game” is an Aaron Sorkin film with acres and acres of dialogue. Was that daunting?

I feel everything I had ever done prepared me. This is a dream for an actress. It’s not normal for a film to really rely on what a female character says. I understood the importance of that. I understood the importance of doing an Aaron Sorkin film. He’s a political filmmaker. This is a film about gender politics, patriarchy. You see it with Molly’s father, and in her family, and in her industry and in the government. This was an issue 50 years ago, and now, because it’s in the newspapers, everyone’s interested. It’s always interested me, what women do to navigate patriarchy. To me Aaron’s always been a filmmaker with a sense of justice and idealism. When I got this script, it was something I was waiting for my whole life, to be able to sink my teeth into a female character like this.

How did you prepare?

I wanted to be filmable perfect for Aaron Sorkin. I worked with Molly, she’s very different than I am and very much a sensual being. I don’t see myself in that way at all. I spent a lot of time talking with her, and observing how she presents herself in the world. I talked to players who played in her game, and went to a New York game and observed what that room is like. There were women going around and massaging men and getting apple pie or chicken noodle soup if the guys were hungry.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

By sensual, do you mean in the luscious ’50s film star kind of way?

We live in society that values women for their sexual desirability. In the beginning of the film, many men tell Molly she needs to change what she looks like. She’s told her dress is ugly and to buy new shoes. Molly had to put this mask on, of this uber sexual being. For the guys to listen to her, to acknowledge her, to see her, she in a way had to objectify herself. And what I appreciated was I never felt objectified in the story. It was the first time I every worked with a [female cinematographer, Charlotte Bruus Christensen]. Aaron said from the very beginning he didn’t want the film to have a male gaze, because it’s Molly’s story. It was the first time on set, wearing these kinds of clothes, where I felt in control of my own body.

High Tea

In a gated office building off Sunset Boulevard, tucked between a parking lot and two motels, about 25 people gathered one recent Saturday for “White Rabbit High Tea.” Jessica Cole Eriksen, 34, began hosting tea parties in April 2016 after working as a nanny in Ireland where brew was a daily ritual. “I’m rolling joints so, everyone, let’s get rolling,” said Ms. Eriksen, who brought a box filled with masks and hats for people to wear. “I’m so happy you are here on this lovely afternoon.”

Some were friends or guests who read about the tea party, which cost $65, online. “I saw it on Instagram last month, and I thought I would come,” said Bridgett Davis, in between puffs under her leopard-print hat. “In December I’m going to pull out my mink. It’s a different kind of crowd, not teenagers or millennials.”

Holden Jagger, a former executive pastry chef at the Soho House who started a cannabis cooking and cultivation business last year, prepared the meal. The table was set with place cards, gold lace paper napkins and strategically arranged ashtrays. There was no pot in the roasted corn and buttermilk scones. But there were plenty of joints, vape pens and edibles on the table. A server wearing a crimson dress and rabbit ears poured peach green tea.

Tara Dawn Roseman, an eyebrow aesthetician, examined a bottle of lotion infused with medical marijuana.

“My dad loves this stuff,” said Roxanne Dennant, whose company, Fruit Slabs, makes cannabis-infused fruit leather. “He rubs it on his hands.”

“My hands are always hurting,” Ms. Roseman said.

“Then use some!” Ms. Dennant said. “They are on the table to be used.”

There were a lot of products to try: cannabis-infused cellulite cream, lip balm, chocolate cookies and small bottles of artisanal buds from Northern California. Ms. Roseman brought some pot from home, which she dumped on a plate so she could roll a joint. Platters of finger sandwiches were passed.

“Do you find yourself with friends that want to talk about something else?” said Ms. Dennant. “We can’t. We are passionate.”

Ms. Eriksen refrained from smoking because she was pregnant. She watched as guests eyed the buds on the table. “You get a gift bag so you don’t need to pocket anything,” she said.

As caramel popcorn and apple pie cookies were passed, the table grew silent. A man put a zebra mask over his face and scrolled through his cellphone. “I was just staring off into the sky and thinking, ‘I am sufficiently stoned,’” Ms. Dennant said.

Ms. Davis said, “You feel like not talking so much anymore.”

Mr. Jagger joined the table. “I had a mom give me a cookie once,” he said, recalling his early 20s. “I just couldn’t talk for a while. My arms were moving, but my mouth wasn’t working. She put a whole plant into butter and it was pretty strong.”

When he was a younger man, Mr. Jagger said, he prided himself in baking potent cookies. Nowadays, cooks are better at tempering the high. “The idea that we can manage it,” he said, “takes the fun out of it.”

Budtender to the Stars

Maya Cooper was dressed in raspberry tights, gold chains and a blue kufi, a tableau that looked vaguely like vintage MC Hammer. It was the day before Halloween, and Snoop Dogg was hosting his wife’s birthday party, a 1980s-themed bash in an industrial building near the airport. “It’s my job to know everybody,” said Ms. Cooper, holding court in a hazy, smoke-filled lounge packed with couches and a bar crowded with jars of marijuana bud, rolling papers and smoking accessories.

Ms. Cooper, 31, is the associate director of marketing for Merry Jane, a digital media company started in 2015 by Snoop Dogg to promote marijuana culture. She is better known, though, as a “budtender” to the stars. An Ohio native who once worked for Rolling Stone, she said she taught Gwyneth Paltrow how to use a vape pen. She has hosted bud bars at parties for Diplo and Calvin Harris, the music producers. Ms. Cooper has even spun cannabis-infused sugar into cotton candy for Miley Cyrus at a birthday party for Ms. Cyrus’s boyfriend, Liam Hemsworth.

These days marijuana is marketed like coffee beans. Humboldt’s Finest, a collective from Northern California, was that night’s sponsor. Among the strains scrawled on a menu were Sunset Sherbet (“luscious melty treat”), Cookies (“an uplifting, potent high”) and OG Kush (“for total body melt”). A guest sidled up to the bar and asked for six joints and some buds for a bong. On the dance floor, where Snoop Dogg was twirling with his wife, trays of pre-rolled joints were passed by female servers.

Last January Ms. Cooper teamed up with a dispensary to host a bar at the 30th birthday party for Cade Hudson, a talent agent who works for Creative Artists Agency. The party was held on the roof of an apartment complex in Beverly Hills, and about 200 people showed up. The singer Nick Jonas asked for a joint, Ms. Cooper said. Others kept their distance. “Sometimes celebrities will pass by,” she said. “They aren’t interested in coming to the station. So we bring the gift bag to them.”

Ms. Cooper said sponsors don’t get paid to give away product, which makes a bar a costly proposition. The average price of a joint is about $3.50; small batch or craft cannabis costs twice that. “It’s hard to regulate celebrities,” she said. “They are used to having whatever they want.” The music crowd is notoriously grabby. So much so, she toyed with the idea of making people who give parties pay. Ms. Cooper said they ran out of pre-rolled joints halfway through the night at a Def Jam event during Grammy week.

“People kept coming back to the bar,” she said. “They try to pretend like they are someone else. They kept stuffing their pockets. Someone even came over to the table, but this time with his hat off. I said, ‘I still recognize you.’”

Bake Sale

When Jessica Assaf talks about marijuana, she always uses the word “she.” “It is the female plant that creates this precious flower,” she said one evening at a party in Venice. The booming cannabis market is filled with female entrepreneurs. “We are a community,” said Ms. Assaf, a former beauty and marketing executive. “And we show up for each other.”

Indeed. About 100 people crowded a fenced-in yard at the home of Abby Gould, an acquaintance of Ms. Assaf’s who works for a firm that invests in the cannabis industry. Lit candles were placed on wooden railings. A singer playing acoustic guitar serenaded guests gathered on the front lawn under a string of lights. No one was sipping chardonnay. The crowd was there for a “Bake Sale” sponsored by Cannabis Feminist, the company Ms. Assaf founded a year ago to sell marijuana wellness products at home.

It was like a Tupperware party for the smoke set. Guests bought tickets for $5, which were exchanged for edibles, creams or smoke. (Gifts of cannabis are allowed, Ms. Assaf said; direct sales are not.) There were oils by Foria to enhance sexual pleasure, a powder from Mondo that could be sprinkled in food to soothe an anxious mind and Hmbldt vape pens to calm, sleep or arouse. One woman bought $105 worth of pink tickets for cannabis-infused capsules with turmeric to reduce chronic inflammation.

Ms. Assaf is adept at creating community among her peers, organizing weekly get-togethers. “It is an important part of reaching the audience,” said Derek McCarty, the chief marketing officer for Hmbldt. “People turn to their best friends for advice.” Cannabis Feminist teamed with Snoop Dogg’s Merry Jane to create a series, “Queens of the Stoned Age,” a chat show with Ms. Assaf and guests who explore their relationship with cannabis. They hired an all-female crew and Ms. Assaf committed to including more ethnically diverse smokers in coming episodes.

Despite the transactional nature of the Bake Sale, there was still, as one might imagine, a relaxed vibe.

Hannah Mason, a founder of Lit Yoga, set up a low-slung table and pillows under a tree. She had nothing to sell; she was there to support her female mates. Ms. Mason served green tea and passed joints to passers-by who joined her, something she and her students share before every yoga class. One student, Ryan Der, a maker of custom iron doors, was there. “It’s cool to connect with humans,” he said, packing a rolling paper. “Most of the time everyone is on their phones.”","Hey, ‘Budtender’: Los Angeles’s Power Brokers of Pot Crank Up the Kook",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/style/marijuana-clubs-los-angeles.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen returns with a puzzle that puts things inside of other things, as opposed to Monty Python’s Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things.

Today’s Theme

I normally love Mr. Chen’s puzzles and he is a godsend to beginning puzzle makers who are learning the art of construction, but I have to say that this one confused me. I get the theme, but I believe that solvers will have to take the theme clues absolutely literally in order to solve it. I made this a lot harder on myself by expecting the answers to the clues to “read” like a new phrase, and they do not. As always, your mileage will vary.

If you solve cryptic crosswords, you are used to seeing indicator words in the clues. Words like “about” or “around” can indicate to solvers that they need to look for a word that is wrapped “around” another word, or that another word is inside. Keep that in mind as you solve. At 22A, for example, the clue “Lists about a port on the Black Sea” has as its answer ROYAL TASTERS, and the letters for YALTA are either shaded or circled. The word “about” in this clue means that the “Lists” are literally “about,” or wrapped around “a port on the Black Sea.”

Don’t see it? Let’s zoom in a little closer:

ROYAL TASTERS: YALTA is the Black Sea port

Now let’s see what’s “about” YALTA:

ROYAL TASTERS: ROSTERS is what’s “about” YALTA, and a roster is a list. “Lists about a post on the Black Sea.”

Got that?

Let’s try another one. At 92A, “Fear among underground workers” solves as MINDREADERS. That doesn’t really make sense, so let’s dice this up:

MINDREADERS: DREAD is “among” or inside “underground workers.”

MINDREADERS: Those “underground workers” are MINERS.

Those worked well for me, but not all of the theme entries hung together, in my opinion. Well, that’s not entirely true; they work under the strictest interpretation, but some of the phrases and clues Mr. Chen used seemed a bit random to me. “Flourishes around monsoon events,” for example, is an odd but lexical phrase. The answer, BRAIN SURGEONS, would be absolutely mystifying if you hadn’t gotten some of the easier theme entries first. BURGEONS means “Flourishes,” but it probably wouldn’t be my first guess, and it goes around RAINS, or “monsoon events.”

Like I said, stick to the literal interpretation of what the indicator words are asking you to do, and you’ll do fine.

Constructor’s Notes

This puzzle was my first accepted puzzle in The New York Times, so it holds a soft spot in my heart. It was one of the first puzzles that I ever created, and looking back, I’m still pretty happy with the fill. I tried to open up the northeast and southwest corners by dumping the black squares beside YALE and FIRS, but couldn’t find any decent options for the long spot at 28-Down. The southwest actually caused the most trouble during the fill, which is why DIFFUSE is there instead of the snazzier seven-letter answers in the other corners. Clue-wise, pumped to see ODA get a clue other than “harem room.” I also have fond memories of watching reruns of “Let’s Make a Deal” at my grandparents’ house when I was a kid. And, the game show inspired a nifty little probability brain teaser called the Monty Hall problem (try it out if you haven’t heard of it!).

I had to look this up and this problem is a YouTube sensation. Here’s a demo:

Mr. Müller stopped short of calling for a quick end to the subsidies, and he may have just been acknowledging reality. Until last year, more than half of all cars sold in Europe were diesels, which were marketed as being not only economical but also environmentally friendly.

But diesel began to lose popularity after studies by the governments of France, Germany and Britain showed that the diesel cars from almost all manufacturers polluted much more than advertised. Though only Volkswagen has been accused of criminal behavior, many others exploited weak enforcement and loopholes in regulations. As a result, European cities like Madrid or Athens often have unhealthy levels of nitrogen oxides, which can cause asthma and lung cancer.

The decline in diesel’s market share has accelerated this year after cities like London, concerned about nitrogen oxide pollution, began taking steps to keep diesels out of city centers. Diesel vehicles produce far more nitrogen oxides than their gasoline-powered counterparts.

In another break from his peers, Mr. Müller said on Sunday that he was in favor of banning older diesels from city centers. But he said such restrictions should not apply to newer diesels that meet stricter standards on nitrogen oxide emissions.

Previously, Mr. Müller and the chief executives of BMW and Daimler insisted that diesel engines with the latest antipollution equipment were clean and that the technology still had a future.

An end to diesel subsidies could fall particularly hard on BMW and Daimler because they would have trouble selling large, profitable luxury cars without the fuel economy benefits offered by diesel. Volkswagen has recently begun converting one of its German factories to produce electric cars, vowing to be the company that will make battery-powered vehicles practical and affordable for the masses.

Germany and most other countries in Europe tax diesel fuel at a lower rate than gasoline, providing a powerful incentive for consumers in a region where gasoline costs $6 a gallon or more. The subsidy was based on the theory that diesel cars burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline and thus contribute less to global warming.

Diesel has been fundamental to the success of German carmakers. Volkswagen was among the first manufacturers to offer affordable diesel passenger cars that did not smoke and rattle, and parlayed its technical advantage into dominance of the European car market.

If diesel were taxed at the same rate as gasoline, Professor Dudenhöffer said, the German government would collect 8 billion euros, or $9.4 billion, more in revenue.

“Diesel is not the future, it’s the past,” he said. “It makes no sense to spend billions of tax money on the technology.”","VW Chief Breaks Ranks on Diesel, Suggesting End to Subsidies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/business/volkswagen-diesel-subsidies.html

He was on his way from 145th Street in Manhattan to the multiplex movie theater on 42nd Street where he works.

“I’m just seeing about it,” Mr. Fernandez said, thumbing his screen. “It’s messed up.”

Overhearing this, another man frowned. “What? When did that happen?” he asked. Just before 7:30 in the morning, he was told. “I was asleep,” he explained.

Brought up to speed on the calamity that did not quite happen, neither man had the slightest intention of altering his route.

Louis Bernier knew about the bomber before he boarded the A train in Washington Heights, pushing a stroller with his son Oliver, age 2 and a half. Indeed, he quickly summoned an inventory of recent terrible events, the killing of eight people on a bike path in Lower Manhattan this fall, and the derailment of an A train in June. “Now that it’s over, I expect that it’s safe to travel,” Mr. Bernier said. “We cannot stop living. There was the event on the bike path last month. I tell you, I’m more concerned by the derailment on this line last summer. My son and I are on the train every day. He loves all kinds of transport.”

In principle, the power of all bombs depends on the rapid expansion of gas under pressure, compression being an essential condition. A line of black gunpowder sprinkled on the ground will flare out with little effect. Packed into a container like a bullet shell or a jar and ignited, it can produce killing force. In the summer of 1997, acting on a tip, the police raided an apartment on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn and found parts of five pipe bombs, apparently destined for the Atlantic Avenue subway station. Two men were shot in the raid.

Besides the containerized nature of subway cars and tunnels, the crowds amplify the risks, a reality also on congested streets. A former superintendent of subway stations alerted officials in 2008 that it was possible for an evildoer to padlock gates intended for escape.

The current estimated number of things that can go wrong is put at infinity.

“Does it look like people are staying out of the subway?” asked Carolina Selia, a voice coach. She had a point: At midmorning, it was standing-room-only on her A train.

“You have to be a tough breed to survive in this town,” she said, but she noted that it wasn’t just the locals who keep going. Clients are coming to the city from Nashville this weekend. “They are going to see shows, and I’m telling you, they are still very determined,” Ms. Selia said. “They’re going to be in Times Square.”

Most Monday mornings, Ronald Rojas, a subway singer, does not rush out of his bed in the Bronx. “Mondays are slow,” said Mr. Rojas, whose nom de D train is B_Ron_X. But he was out early this Monday after hearing news of the bomb. “I figured, people are nervous already, they need someone who makes them feel a little better,” Mr. Rojas said, nominating himself. Plus, he acknowledged, the police were probably too busy to give him a ticket. “I guess that is secretly also why I am out here,” he said.

Cloistered, for now, mostly behind the Kremlin walls, the intrigues are expected to burst into public view with increasing frequency in coming years.

Several internal battles have already erupted publicly, including the dismantling of a respected research university and a startling corruption trial in which a former minister accused of soliciting bribes said he was set up by a former spy who has been a close Putin ally. It is the kind of fight the president would have managed privately in previous years.

“You cannot hide the enormous tension, the enormous degree of uncertainty within the Russian elite,” said Konstantin Gaaze, who contributes political analysis to the website of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a policy research organization. “They will do stupid things; they will blackmail each other; they will write reports about each other and bring them to Putin.”

For the coming three months, the election will be the main distraction. Then Mr. Putin, who will turn 72 in 2024, is expected to start building something of a retirement plan.

In the view of some analysts, the president believes that trying to retain the job for life would be a mistake. One day, if he stays too long, he could be hastily deposed — like the recent experience of President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe after 37 years in office.

“Putin thinks of himself as an historical figure, and he knows that if he wants to put himself into the history books, he should not repeat Mugabe’s mistake — he should find the right time to leave,” said Konstantin Kalachyov, the head of the Political Expert Group and an occasional consultant for the Kremlin.

At the same time, Mr. Putin is likely to want to preserve some political role after 2024 and not simply retire to his dacha, or worse, end up in jail.

“He cannot just go,” Mr. Gaaze said. “He knows perfectly well that if his successor fails, they will both be prosecuted.”

Some expect Mr. Putin to reshape the Constitution to create some kind of higher military or security council, appointing himself to lead it and securing his influence. “I cannot imagine a situation where he gives all power to the successor; he does not trust anybody,” Mr. Gaaze said.

Mr. Putin has done something similar before. When his second consecutive term as president ended in 2008, he served as prime minister during the one-term presidency of Dmitri A. Medvedev, although it was understood he remained the country’s ultimate leader. Starting with the election of 2012, the president’s term in office was extended from four years to six.

Mr. Pavlovsky, who worked in the Kremlin under President Boris N. Yeltsin, recalled that the process to replace Mr. Yeltsin, who was ailing, began right after he won the 1996 election and would clearly not run again.

It meant rebuilding the state, not just replacing the man.

“We knew that Yeltsin would be gone in 2000, and we did not want the state to go with him,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “It was Yeltsin’s Russia. Yeltsin was going, so Yeltsin’s Russia was going too, and we had to found a new Russia.”

Mr. Yeltsin appointed Mr. Putin his successor in 2000, and he has been the most powerful man in Russia ever since. Because Mr. Putin has centralized so much power, the question of who will succeed him is especially urgent.

“Today we have Putin’s Russia,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “If Putin is gone, Putin’s Russia also has to go. That is also a dangerous situation. His entourage understands this and wants to preserve Putin’s Russia after he is gone.”

So the various factions within the Putin Court will seek to convince the president to name an heir apparent who best preserves their collective interests.

For those angling to succeed the president, it is a high-wire act. Candidates need to be careful not to be seen as an immediate threat to the president, notoriously protective of his position. Push too hard, too fast, and a person could be purged.

And as 2024 nears, Mr. Putin’s ability to protect likely successors could lessen, putting them at risk of being brought down by rivals. As a result, no one is expected to seek the heir apparent title openly.

“People considered possible successors are ready to pay not to be called that,” Mr. Kalachyov said.

The Kremlin dismissed talk of internal intrigues, with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, calling such speculation the favorite pastime of political analysts. “That is what they do,” he said.

There have already been signs of Mr. Putin’s influence starting to ebb, however, and a few brutish spats among the elite have spilled into the open.

Russia’s former economy minister, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, delivered a long, emotional soliloquy at the closing of his corruption trial on Thursday about what he views as political treachery.

He faces up to 10 years in a penal colony on charges of soliciting a $2 million bribe to approve a major oil deal sought by the state oil giant Rosneft, run by Igor I. Sechin, a Putin ally and former military intelligence agent.

Mr. Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty, accusing Mr. Sechin of setting up a cloak-and-dagger sting operation by proffering a gift of fine wine and homemade sausages to disguise a brown leather satchel brimming with dollars.

In his speech, the former minister warned the Kremlin elite that anyone could be next in the docket. “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee,” he said, quoting the classic lines of John Donne. “It can toll for any one of you. It’s become very easy: a bag, a basket, a grainy video, three clicks, and it’s ready.”

In a show of force, Mr. Sechin refused a court summons to appear as a witness at the trial four times, saying he was too busy.

Aside from Mr. Ulyukayev, Mr. Sechin appears intent on crushing Sistema, a wealthy investment firm, by filing repeated lawsuits — despite public admonitions from Mr. Putin that he would like such disputes settled amicably.

Mr. Sechin also publicly, and unexpectedly, pledged to work with Ramzan Kadyrov, the autocratic leader of Chechnya. Both men have shown an increasing tendency to act independently of Mr. Putin, distancing themselves even though it was the president’s protection that allowed both to become outsize figures with vast fortunes and personal fiefs.

If Mr. Sechin and Mr. Kadyrov share a common cause, it is trying to help choose the next president, the best insurance for those in the inner circle. “Because the others, except those who decide the successor to Putin, will all be in great danger,” Mr. Pavlovsky said.

The more Mr. Putin becomes a lame duck, analysts said, the less influence he may have in choosing a successor and the more Kremlin insiders will assert themselves. Many point to the case of the European University at St. Petersburg as an example that Mr. Putin’s protection is no longer as robust.

By numerous accounts, Mr. Putin tried to preserve the university, a respected private, liberal, postgraduate institution. Conservative nationalists hated it, and real estate developers coveted the historic Small Marble Palace where it was housed.

First the university lost its building, and last week it was denied an operating license for the third time. The demise came despite what one senior university official and various Russian news reports described as three attempts by Mr. Putin to get the Education Ministry to protect the place.

“What matters now is your own potential independent of Putin,” Mr. Pavlovsky said, “because the moment is rapidly approaching when Putin will not be able to help you.”",Putin’s Re-election Is Assured.

The evening shift was about to begin at two nearby factories owned by Foxconn and Panasonic.

Most of the workers had been recruited from Romania, Bulgaria and other Central European countries by a large employment agency. When their contracts are up, they will be sent home, with another group of migrant workers brought in as required — replaceable cogs in a tireless machine.

Across Europe, nearly 55,000 agencies recruit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers each year for cheap manual labor and service jobs. The agencies allow employers to tap into a more flexible work force — and avoid some of the region’s more onerous labor costs.

Those agencies recruiting manual labor scour the Continent for people willing to pick vegetables in Britain, pour concrete in France or work assembly lines in Eastern Europe. While they receive monthly pay, they often work long days, so their wages can average out to as little as 3.50 euros, or about $4.10, an hour — less than the minimum wage in some of the countries. Some agencies control entire labor supply chains, transporting recruits across borders, lodging them, busing them to and from job sites, and then moving them elsewhere when they’re no longer needed.

The practices are legal under rules that allow European citizens to work anywhere in the 28-nation bloc. But as employers outsource more workers and deepen their reliance on shorter-term contracts to cut costs, European regulators are increasing their scrutiny. About a third of Europeans are now in some form of atypical employment, ranging from Uber drivers to pilots, and there are concerns that basic labor protections, including social security benefits and sick leave, are being eroded.

Got a confidential news tip about sexual harassment? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

“I’ve done nothing wrong,” he said in a brief interview last week. “I’m happy to visit with anybody who has a concern and explain the facts to the extent that I am allowed to under the settlement agreement.”

Details of Ms. Greene’s allegations have been known for several years, ever since she filed suit against Mr. Farenthold in 2014; she said, among other things, that Mr. Farenthold told another aide he was having “sexual fantasies” about her and that she was fired after she complained.

But she was not the only Farenthold aide to find fault with the office environment; in 2016, two additional aides complained — prompting the congressman to hire an independent law firm to investigate, a spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold, Stacey Daniels, confirmed in a statement.

One aide reported that Mr. Farenthold’s chief of staff, Bob Haueter, treated the female employees “differently.” The second aide — identified by The Houston Chronicle as Elizabeth Peace, a former press secretary to Mr. Farenthold — reported to Mr. Haueter that the first employee “did herself engage in inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace,” the statement said.

The review found no evidence of “gender bias” or “inappropriate sexualized comments,” Ms. Daniels said, adding that all staff members, including Mr. Farenthold, later “took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure full compliance with office policy and the law.”

In an interview, Ms. Peace said “the behavior never changed,” which was partly why she decided to quit in March. “There were a lot of inappropriate things that happened in that office that I don’t think would have happened if the congressman hadn’t already set the tone,” she said.

Ms. Peace and another former aide to Mr. Farenthold, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harming that aide’s reputation, described an atmosphere in his Washington office that was freewheeling, yet also filled with anxiety.

The congressman, they said, was volatile. When he was angry, they added, Mr. Farenthold would berate them, sometimes sweeping his arm across his desk, knocking its contents to the floor, and threatening to fire people. Ms. Daniels, who has worked for Mr. Farenthold since March, said she had never witnessed such behavior, adding, “All the staff get along here very well.”

The refrigerator in the “bullpen” — the open area where aides worked — was filled with beer, and sometimes happy hour would begin at 4:30 p.m., which his aides called “beer-thirty.” Ms. Peace said women would discuss which male lobbyists had texted them pictures of their genitals, and both men and women would talk about strip clubs and whether certain Fox News anchors had breast implants.

“There were numerous lewd comments that were made either about female reporters’ breast size, or other reporters’ breast size as well as female lobbyists and their appearance that would go on,” the other former aide said. “On any given week you were prone to either ridicule, rude comments, acts of aggression or rage.”

In the office, the congressman was known to like redheads. In her complaint, Ms. Greene said Mr. Farenthold “regularly drank to excess, and because of his tendency to flirt, the staffers who accompanied him to Capitol Hill functions would joke that they had to be on ‘redhead patrol’ to keep him out of trouble.”

In their response, lawyers for Mr. Farenthold acknowledged that “some staff occasionally joked that Rep. Farenthold finds redheads attractive.” But they said he denied the rest of that allegation, including “the implication that this was a source for, or cause of, concern for any staffer.”

Experts in civil rights and employment law say that the culture of any office or organization is set from the top and that sexual harassment may be more prevalent in workplaces in which there is anger and infighting among employees.

“If you are trying to create a workplace where sexual harassment and other sorts of unlawful harassment don’t happen, you really need to be thinking about workplace culture more broadly and about civility and respect,” said Emily Martin, the general counsel for the National Women’s Law Center here.

Kristin Nicholson, who spent 20 years as a House aide and now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, said that every office on Capitol Hill reflected the personality of the lawmaker and the chief of staff.

“Anecdotally we all know that there are offices out there that are really toxic or unpleasant to work in, whether it’s sexual staff or the way that stuff is treated,” Ms. Nicholson said. “I don’t think that’s the norm, but it’s certainly not unusual for staffers to be subjected to inappropriate comments or sexist remarks.”

Mr. Farenthold, who turns 56 on Tuesday, has had a whiff of notoriety about him ever since he first ran for office in 2010. At the time, he was best known as a host of a conservative radio show. But during his campaign, photographs surfaced of him at a costume party, wearing duck-print pajamas and standing next to a scantily clad woman.

He won the election, ousting Representative Solomon P. Ortiz, then an incumbent Democrat who had served for more than two decades, by less than one percentage point. The Republican-controlled legislature then redrew the district lines, making the district much more conservative. He is now serving his fourth term.

In 2014, the same year in which Ms. Greene sued him, Mr. Farenthold announced that he would be giving up an internet domain name — one that describes a sexually explicit act — that he had held since 1999, when he was in the business of buying such names on speculation and selling them.",Tawdry Tales Depict a Texas Congressman’s Frat House on the Hill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/blake-farenthold-sexual-harassment.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Southeast Asia, a region of 600 million people that is adding more internet users each month than anywhere else on the planet, has become a magnet for tech investment — and one of the toughest battlegrounds for Uber, which is under pressure to curb its losses around the world ahead of a planned public offering.

Grab, which was valued at $6 billion after its latest fund-raising, recently said it had completed its billionth ride. By contrast, Lyft, Uber’s largest American rival, has reached half that.

“It is a super growth market,” said Brooks Entwistle, chief business officer in Asia for Uber, which on Friday announced it had agreed to form a joint venture with a Singapore taxi company to strengthen its competitiveness in the region. “There’s no question there are challenges.”

China’s biggest tech companies, spying opportunity in the region, have contributed to those challenges.

Go-Jek is backed by Tencent Holdings, the video game and social media behemoth. Grab this year received a combined $2 billion in investment from Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing powerhouse that outgunned Uber in China, and the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.

Outside of transport, the Alibaba Group, which dominates online shopping in China, controls a regional e-commerce company called Lazada and has invested in Tokopedia, an Indonesian site. Tencent is a major shareholder of Sea, a Singapore-based company that operates a video game platform, shopping site and digital payments service.

“We all looked to China” to learn to develop e-commerce, said Nick Nash, Sea’s president. “The playbook was clear.”

It is no accident that Jakarta has attracted so many companies that help people get around — or that help them avoid having to get around in the first place.

The capital of the world’s fourth-most-populous nation has 10 million residents but no metro system. The traffic is so soul-crushing at all times that many residents have stopped speaking of discrete rush hours.

“In Southeast Asia, there’s little public transport, many dense cities and low car ownership,” said Ming Maa, Grab’s president. “It makes ride-sharing a much more compelling product than in India or even, frankly, China.”

Before ride-hailing apps came along, motorcycle taxis, or “ojek” in Indonesian, plied Jakarta’s clogged streets. But getting a good price required haggling. And safety was a concern, particularly for women.

Go-Jek is a “lifesaver,” said Hera Diani, a magazine editor in Jakarta. She orders food on the app, and booked a pedicure through Go-Life when she was pregnant and couldn’t walk easily. “The traffic jams are getting worse and worse,” she said.

Both Grab and Go-Jek are making big pushes outside transportation. The companies want their app-based wallets to replace cash as the main way Indonesians pay for coffee, fried rice and everything else offline, as is commonplace in Chinese cities.

It is unproven, though, that people will stick with a payment app just because they use it for rides. China’s dominant mobile payment services, AliPay and WeChat Pay, grew big because they could easily be used to buy stuff online and transfer money to friends, respectively.

Steve Cobb, who served on the university’s board of trustees, called Dr. Curran “an exceptional leader for this university during his 14-year tenure.”

“During that time, the university grew in size and stature by almost every measure and was positioned for continued growth,” Mr. Cobb said.

The average compensation for presidents at the surveyed private colleges who were in office for the full year rose 9 percent in 2015, to $570,000, and came after a 9 percent increase in 2014. The pay of the average American worker rose between 3 and 4 percent in each year, according to the Social Security Administration.

Private colleges tend to pay their presidents more than public ones do. The Chronicle’s most recent compilation for public universities showed eight earning compensation packages exceeding $1 million, led by Michael Crow of Arizona State University, at $1.6 million.

As presidents’ pay has risen unabated, lawmakers have begun criticizing the size of some universities’ endowments, which are currently untaxed. The tax bills that passed in the House and Senate each include a 1.4 percent tax on earnings of some college endowments, including many of the nation’s most elite schools. As many as 70 schools with large endowments could be affected by that tax, depending on which version of the bill is adopted.

Last year, three influential Republican legislators, led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, sent a letter to 56 private universities with endowments of $1 billion or more, requesting information on “the numerous tax preferences” they enjoy. “Despite these large and growing endowments,” the letter said, “many colleges and universities have raised tuition far in excess of inflation.”

A look at the costs of private colleges by the College Board suggests that while tuition has risen dramatically, the actual price paid by students after grants and financial aid has increased only 5 percent over the past 10 years.

But concerns have been raised about growing student debt. In a presentation earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that student debt was $1.3 trillion at the end of 2016, an increase of about 170 percent since 2006.

Dr. Eaton said the high salaries paid to private university presidents often are tied to the wealth of endowments.

“The unfortunate dynamic is that you see where the extreme wealth of private universities, and their ability to pay higher executive salaries, creates a norm that other universities feel pressured to follow,” Dr. Eaton said.",Big Jump in Million-Dollar Pay Packages for Private College Leaders,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/us/college-presidents-pay.html

The state is so often stellar in football, residents say ruefully, and not much else, a consequence of generations of bitter fights, political turbulence and eternal divides over race and class.

About 17 percent of Alabamians live in poverty — the fifth-highest rate in the country — and the state’s violence-wracked prisons are jammed to 159 percent of their intended capacity. With budget troubles a chronic fact of life, spending on Medicaid, which has not been expanded, lags. Standardized test scores are among the nation’s lowest. Heart disease and diabetes are endemic.

Last year, Marion, a rural city in central Alabama, suffered a tuberculosis outbreak so severe that its incidence rate was worse than that of many developing countries.

The infant mortality rate for 2016 rose to 9.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, the highest rate the state has seen since 2008. (The national rate was 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, the most recent year for which federal data is available.) The mortality rate was more than twice as high for black infants as white ones, and in some parts of the state, like Perry or Pickens Counties, the rate was 25.6 and 30.3.

“I think we really don’t know why it’s going up,” said Grace Thomas, the assistant state health officer for family health services with the state’s Department of Public Health, who called the rates a “key indicator of a health care system’s effectiveness” and said black, Hispanic and poor women were less likely to get the care they need.

Paris Daves, 24, said it took her several months after she found out she was pregnant last year to get on Medicaid, although she has since drawn support from an organization called Gift of Life, which works to prevent infant mortality in Montgomery. But as a young, single parent, there are other problems, too, like unreliable public transportation and low wages.

“Minimum wage here is $7.25,” said Ms. Daves, who earns a dollar more than that as a shift manager at McDonald’s. “That’s not enough to pay my rent or take care of my son.”

In Haleyville, northwest of Birmingham, the coming shutdown of the hospital looms over the city where, in 1968, the country’s first 911 call was made.

But you can pick anyplace in Alabama and find issues that feel somewhere between daunting and suffocating. In the Black Belt, named for its rich topsoil, but now a region of widespread rural poverty, people still wonder whether once-plentiful jobs will ever come back.

Along the Black Warrior River in Tuscaloosa, professionals and university professors worry about Alabama’s reputation and whether companies with money to spend might look elsewhere. Indeed, many fear that the ultimate fallout from the race will be yet another hit to the state’s reputation and attractiveness as a place to do business.

Huntsville cares about federal spending that helps power an economy that depends on rockets and missiles.

National reporters flocked to a town hall last month in Gadsden hoping for animated discussion of Mr. Moore and the Senate race. Instead, most of the conversation was about opioids, economic development and the extension of Interstate 759.

People here know that no single senator can fix all of Alabama’s ills. Many of the state’s troubles, residents acknowledge, must be solved at the State House in Montgomery, not in Washington. But as the campaign for a rare open Senate seat droops to an end that just about everyone here says cannot come soon enough, there is no shortage of regret that the tawdry overtook the tangible, and topics of statewide concern got little hearing.

“There’s really no other way to put it than a missed opportunity,” said Will Walker, a bank president in Haleyville, the largest city in a county where President Trump won 90 percent of the vote last year. “We’ve had so little discussion about issues, it’s disappointing.”

The state, like its neighbors in the South, is desperate to preserve the economic lifeboats that have emerged in recent decades: big-name foreign manufacturers who put down stakes in exchange for cheap labor, low taxes and lavish incentive packages.

The economic model has created a strange dichotomy: While Alabama often generates headlines about culture-war battles that outsiders view as hopelessly provincial, the flavor of commerce is increasingly, and proudly, international.

Airbus, a French company, assembles jets at a state-of-the-art, $600 million factory in Mobile, working with pieces pre-assembled in Spain, Wales, France and Germany. Mercedes-Benz produces luxury SUVs and sedans along Interstate 20 in Tuscaloosa County. Hyundai has been producing vehicles in Alabama since 2005; Honda, since 2001.

But the strategy only works so well. In 1999, according to census figures, Alabama’s median household income lagged the national median by about $7,800. Today, Alabama lags behind the national median by more than $11,000.

Samuel N. Addy, an economist at the University of Alabama, said the state still has glaring public sector needs in education, infrastructure, health and prisons.

“Those are our four major ones,” said Mr. Addy, “and all of them require raising revenues to meet the needs here. But I don’t think the climate is such that we are open to raising revenues much.”

The poor quality of public education, in particular, has long been a concern in a state where the gap between rich and poor residents — and white and black ones — remains a nagging reality.

The concerns have only seemed to mount with the realization that 21st century manufacturing jobs often require advanced understanding of computer systems: Building a jet is just not the same as running a loom. A year ago, then-governor Robert Bentley, a former church deacon not prone to strong language, at least in public, put the matter in shockingly blunt terms: “Our education system in this state sucks.”

In Escambia County, near the Florida border and the site of Alabama’s death row, Laurine Gentry, 37, said she, too, worried about the state’s schools. This year, she said, the area voted to consolidate some schools, and she worries about her kindergartner, who she says has to ride the bus with high schoolers.

“He hears and sees things that maybe he shouldn’t,” she said.

Ms. Gentry, who said her husband is serving a prison term elsewhere in Alabama, also described the state’s deteriorating prisons. Her husband, she knows, can take care of himself behind bars, but she said the strain on the system is obvious to her family.

“My husband’s last probation officer told me he’s sorry he failed me and my children, because he’s got 70 guys to look after, because it’s hard,” Ms. Gentry said.

Indeed, Escambia County is but one place that struggles. Even with the state’s vast presence and a nearby casino, Main Street is sprinkled with shuttered businesses.

Azu Nwagbogu, the festival’s founder and director, spoke with James Estrin about photography in Africa. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

What is your goal with the Lagos photo festival?

A.

I feel like photography has the power to make us understand the world better and to create empathy. So the goal is to have more visual storytellers telling more new stories to enable us to imagine a newer, better, richer, more prosperous, more safe, more empowered Africa.

In the past, the stories were told to create pity, and pity is an emotion that is not sustainable, that is easily dismissed, that does not allow us to understand or appreciate how to engage in that community. You just look away. And we are not trying to make people look away, we are trying to make people understand and invite them to share and to be part of that story.

Q.

How did you put together this year’s festival?

A.

The theme of the festival is Regimes of Truth. We are exploring a further understanding of the post-truth society that we live in. Now we are either inundated with so much information, or we have constructed another reality of what the truth is.

So it’s really looking at the way photography, the media and artists explore these notions of what is true and what is real. Because photography was founded on the science of observation, and it has always flattered itself to be a representative or an arbiter of truth.

In contemporary society, we now know that an image can be very deceptive and it can be propaganda. But at the same time we understand that visual language is becoming more decipherable by many more people, and that’s one of the reasons why I feel Africa is getting a lot of attention, mainly because of photography.

Photography created a pejorative view of the continent. Photography is also able to emancipate the impression that we have of Africa.

We have some really interesting work. Samuel Fosso’s “Black Pope” (Slide 7) explores the way religion and its symbols and objects that are used to create the narrative of a papal figure are so removed from the African context and culture that it almost promotes this idea of whiteness and white supremacy. In the history of the papacy, there has never been a black pope, while today the greatest number of Roman Catholics is actually in Africa.

Q.

In the 19th century, photography was thought to be scientifically accurate. Photojournalism still holds the conceit that one can be accurate in a sense. In a “post-truth” society, what does truth mean in relation to photography?

A.

I think through photography, especially photojournalism, we can sometimes establish the facts. When you have the facts, you can build on them and create the architecture that becomes the truth of the story.

Photojournalism is still very important in establishing the facts. How many people died, how many people traveled, who were the people in the room at that time. Photography can still do this. But to tell the story, you need to build a truth. But the truth is complex and the truth is something that we all search for. So I think that is always the balance between photography and visual culture.

Q.

How do you see the history of photography in Africa, and what is the role of photography in Africa today?

A.

It was photography that was used to create a dominant view for the colonizer over the Africans. And that is all about the colonizer with his hand over objects, or over his subjects. And it’s always about power, domination, control. So that’s really been the history of photography on the continent. It’s always been completely based on propaganda.

When we reflect on this in contemporary times, we want to reverse that.

We feel that sometimes we learn more through fiction than through what is considered to be factual. For example, the best information about Russia in the 19th century, when there was a lot of censorship, comes through fiction. So for us, it’s always finding that dance between the fictional and the factual. And also reclaiming African identity, which is really important to us.

We feel like we can’t use one approach. We have to adopt both. A lot of the fictive images seem to get more attention, but we have always had a strong documentary effort in the festivals.

Q.

Other than by exhibiting the stories, how do you build a culture and community of photographers to tell them? Or is that too elitist?

A.

No, I think that’s a mission of the festival. It’s always about building a community that has ownership, passion, and a feeling of adventure and camaraderie. We want to shape the way the stories that relate to Africa are told, and I think that’s really the most important thing that we can achieve. And that’s by shaping and expanding the community of visual storytellers.

One of the legacies of colonial intervention is a fragmentation of community. And where you have fragmentation of community it becomes harder to come together to grow.

We have conventional African storytellers trying to tell stories the way they think the West is interested in seeing the stories. There was not a community to support younger, contemporary visual storytellers on the continent who were trying to find their own voice, trying to find their own language, their own way, their own approach, their own unique, more knowledgeable perspective in telling stories that relate to Africa.

But when you have the community, there is a support for more nuanced, more honest, more true, more representative stories of contemporary Africa.

Q.

I see lot of work from Africa that is more in the art space and employs broader storytelling strategies. Is there a place in the Western media for African photographers? Or do they have to adjust or transform to fit that?

A.

I don’t think they need to transform. I keep hearing people say Africa seems to be in the news, to be hot, to be trending. I think it’s mainly because lots more people are able to tell their own stories and publish their own stories, by themselves, on social media. So that authorship, independent of the mainstream, has generated this interest in the unique voices and stories in Africa.

I don’t think there’s a real need to adapt or to change to a more understandable or decipherable visual language that the West is interested in. It’s more about developing an authentic voice and making sure that it’s consistent and coherent.

Q.

How?

A.

My message to practitioners on the continent is we shouldn’t follow Western journalism or art institutions, which are dominated by white males. Rather, we should innovate and find ways to be more representative, to include other voices. Media houses on the continent have to make sure they have as many women as men, and you have to make sure that you have women as editors. If you have enough diversity from the beginning, it makes it easier to make sure that you’re telling stories that are diverse, that are inclusive, that are more all embracing.

It’s really an exciting time on the continent — a lot is happening and a lot can still happen.

Q.

How about social class?

A.

Class is a massive problem in Africa, but the wonderful thing is that because of the communal nature of society, you’re never too far removed from those above and below you.

Class is always an issue in terms of breaking the mold and inviting more people to engage in the wider public discourse. That’s why contemporary art is so important. You come into an artist’s vision in public spaces where you have what I call interdependence — where people can agree or disagree, share ideas, in a very peaceful and a very safe zone with others of all classes. So there is really no need for conflict.

Q.

How are you bringing work to the public?

A.

We curate exhibitions in public spaces, like parks, where people can leave comments in any language about what they feel about the work. The most interesting comments we get are from people who might not feel comfortable in museums or galleries but feel very comfortable in parks.

Photo

Q.

How did you get involved in photography?

A.

Fifteen years ago when I was a writer and a scientist I realized that photography was the most powerful tool for visual storytelling, engagement and emancipation. And once I got into it I never looked back.

Q.

Were you ever a photographer?

A.

Not at all. I was more of a writer and curator. Those were my interests, my passion, so curating and writing is what I did.

Q.

The festival doesn’t only feature photographers who were born in Africa.

A.

Absolutely not. I think it’s really stupid that people sometimes question that. A lot of the work that exists on the continent has been made by photographers from elsewhere.

Sometimes the work is really, really good and meaningful and nuanced and well done, so why shouldn’t we show that? It’s empowering, and also it’s important that the local photographers see themselves as equals with anyone else. So that’s really the strength of the festival, is the fact that we do not isolate.

When it comes to empowering the continent, we do ourselves a disservice by saying, “You are not black enough” or “You are not African enough.” Because Africans go to Europe and improve the culture — evolve the culture, the language, the music, the art, the sport and everything else.

And when the reverse happens, we get scared or anxious about it. As long as we are shaping the narrative and we are not being overrun by the other voices, it’s important to invite many voices because it’s really about your sensibility, not the color of your skin.

But it’s always about work that relates to the continent. I would say that your color of skin is not important.

Photo

Q.

You talk about Africa, but what does Morocco have in common with Ethiopia, or Ghana? What do you mean when you say Africa?

A.

Africa is the most diverse continent on the planet. So our job really is to tell the stories of these various disparate communities. Presenting these wonderful diverse stories makes us richer.

I don’t think that I have one Africa. I’m a Pan-Africanist. I believe the Pan-Africanist approach is so much more interesting, more fun and more empowering, but at the same time we embrace the diversity across the continent because that makes us richer.

Q.

Then what is the commonality? That they were all colonies of Europe?

A.

Absolutely. The colonial history and the legacy have created a post-colonial continent with post-colonial trauma. We have the symptoms of trauma across the continent as a common theme. So I really don’t want to emphasize too much the negative, but people talk about colonization or colonialism as a stain, but it’s better understood as being actually woven into the very fabric of the continent.

Q.

Can that be transformed into something useful or positive?

A.

It must be, because decolonization starts by owning up to the fact that it’s already intricately woven into our DNA. And once you accept that position, then it empowers you to evolve from that.

When we think about art on the continent, the instinct is to look back. And that nostalgia for the past has kept the continent trapped in this loop.

We look back to before the colonialists’ intervention, to the masks, the sculptures, the objects. But we cannot go back to the masks. We love them, we think they’re beautiful and along with the pyramids they are a testament to the ingenuity of the people on the continent. But going back to that is almost like denying the fact that we have evolved and we are learning and we are able to take from the colonialists and shape a new language, shape a new culture. Because culture really is progressive if you want to find your peace, your balance, to feed your mind, to feed your soul in this world.

We want a future. You see the term Afrofuturism everywhere. We curated a show for the festival four years ago about Afrofuturism — Africans imagining a better future for themselves using technologies, many of which were not created on the continent.

So when you talk about colonization, it’s about saying, “We’re going to shape our future now.” And really shape and control every narrative.

You know the story of the hunt is told by the hunter. The lion will always be the victim. If the lion would be able to tell its own story, the story would be different.

Three years ago, Mr. Nisman was set to testify to the country’s Congress on Ms. Kirchner’s role in the cover up. The day before his testimony, on Jan. 18, 2015, he was found dead in his apartment in Buenos Aires, with a bullet in his head. This, despite the fact that he had a 10-man security detail paid to protect him.

Within hours, Ms. Kirchner announced that Mr. Nisman had committed suicide. In the days that followed, she strangely claimed his death was part of a lovers’ spat. Finally, she changed her story once more: His death may have been the result of rogue intelligence operatives.

When we heard the news of Mr. Nisman’s death and of Ms. Kirchner’s suspected cover-up, we were horrified, but not entirely shocked. Anyone who had followed Mr. Nisman’s pursuit of this case knew that he was assuming grave risks by taking on both a terrorist state and his own government. Through a decade of investigation, Mr. Nisman received death threats against not only him but his children as well. One email he told us about had a picture of bloodied and brutalized bodies lying on the ground, with a note saying this would be the fate of his young daughters if he did not cease his investigation.

None of it stopped him. Fearless and resolute, Mr. Nisman and his team had determined that former Iranian and Hezbollah officials planned the AMIA attack. He was able to show definitively that the plan included no less than Iran’s former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; its minister of intelligence; its foreign minister; the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; the head of the corps’ elite Quds force; the Iranian cultural attaché in Argentina; and the third secretary at Iran’s Embassy in Buenos Aires, as well as the former head of Hezbollah’s external security. His investigation led Interpol to issue red notices — akin to international arrest warrants — against six of the perpetrators. Argentina itself issued arrest warrants for Mr. Rafsanjani and Ali Akbar Velayati, then foreign minister, which Iran predictably disregarded.

But Mr. Nisman did not stop there.

In May 2013, he released a 500-page indictment outlining how Iran had penetrated not just Argentina, but also Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Paraguay, Trinidad, Tobago and Suriname, and how it used mosques, social service organizations and its own embassies to radicalize and recruit terrorists. Mr. Nisman also shared information that helped American authorities determine that Mohsen Rabbani, the Iranian embassy cultural attaché and one of the AMIA bombing masterminds, helped four men, including his disciple, a Guyanese official named Abdul Kadir, plot to blow up the fuel lines at Kennedy International Airport in New York. Mr. Kadir is serving a life sentence in the United States for the foiled plot, which could have led to the loss of countless lives.

In a normal democracy, investigating the murder of a man like Alberto Nisman would be a top priority. But Ms. Kirchner and her allies assured that justice for Mr. Nisman’s murder was stymied for years.

That changed three months ago, when, under Argentina’s new president, Mauricio Macri, a fresh investigation by the Argentine national police found that Mr. Nisman had been drugged with Ketamine, a drug used to sedate animals, then brutally beaten before he was shot in the head.

The case against Ms. Kirchner is based on more than 40,000 legal wiretaps and other evidence, much of it collected by Mr. Nisman, which reveals a secret backchannel between her government and Iran. On Ms. Kirchner’s personal orders, she and her associates used the backchannel to negotiate a public memorandum of understanding that would purportedly have the two countries establish a “truth commission” to jointly identify the culprits of the bombing. Mr. Nisman believed it was designed to expunge the Interpol red notices against the plot’s perpetrators.

One thing is entirely clear: Ms. Kirchner and her allies went to great lengths to establish this backchannel. For example, in 2011, Mr. Timerman, Ms. Kirchner’s foreign minister, made a secret trip to Syria to iron out the plan with Ali Akbar Salehi, then Iran’s foreign minister. This trip was revealed earlier this year by a former Argentine ambassador to Syria in court testimony. Further implicating Ms. Kirchner and Mr. Timerman is a voice recording of him acknowledging Iran’s responsibility in the bombing.

Ramón Allan Bogado, who claims to be a one-time Argentine intelligence agent and is one of those recently indicted, testified last month that the backchannel included an arrangement for Argentina to provide Iran with nuclear technology, with front companies in Argentina and Uruguay to conduct the transactions. He alleged that officials at the highest levels of Argentina’s government were aware of the scheme. If true, this would be even worse than Mr. Nisman had uncovered and may provide a further explanation about why someone wanted him dead.

The judge in the case has asked the Argentine Congress, where Ms. Kirchner serves as a recently elected senator, to strip her of immunity so that she can be arrested and tried. But regardless of what happens to her, Argentina is on track to make amends for more than two decades of gross injustice. President Macri has abandoned Ms. Kirchner’s revisionist history of the 1994 bombing, and he supports an independent investigation that would finally identify who ordered Alberto Nisman’s death.

But President Macri has more challenges ahead. As Mr. Nisman documented, Iran and Hezbollah have penetrated Latin America, and still pose a grave threat to the security of Argentina, the region and the United States.",Iranian Terror.

Although Drake’s Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school’s requested time, the dean still spoke.
“They basically put in writing: ‘We’re not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,’ ” Rossley says.
While advocates may refute Ehrhart’s suggestion that Title IX is now a state issue — unless Title IX and the Clery Act are overturned, state laws conflicting with them will be challenged in court — they concede that they can’t stop emboldened conservative legislatures from trying.
And that’s no accident, say advocates, many of whom have long warned that an attack on Title IX could enable similar attacks on Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act clause that forbids racial discrimination in schools, on which Title IX was modeled.","A decade ago, Title IX was better known as the law that forbade schools to banish women’s sports teams to the parking lot while men got the fields. Schools were required to address campus sexual assault under both Title IX and the 1990 Clery Act — a federal law, named for a Lehigh University freshman raped and killed in her dorm room, that requires colleges to report all campus crimes — but schools were only rarely sanctioned under the act, and few students knew how to lodge Title IX complaints. Reporting to law enforcement offered little help: Federal statistics compiled by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network show that only 310 out of 1,000 rapes are reported to the police. Just 11 of those are referred for prosecution, and just seven lead to felony convictions. Even if the criminal-justice system pursued sexual-assault allegations more aggressively, college victims would still have to face the accused on campus as investigations and prosecutions drag on for months, or even years.

In 2011, following an investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity on campus assault, the Obama administration decided to act. The Office for Civil Rights sent a “dear colleague letter” reminding colleges that sexual harassment and assault create an environment so hostile that women’s access to education is jeopardized, violating their civil rights. The letter noted a commonly cited (though commonly challenged) statistic from the National Institute of Justice that one in five women are victims of attempted or actual sexual assault during college. A subsequent clarification of the letter created no uniform policy for how schools should adjudicate cases, but it offered recommendations like having schools inform students that drinking “never makes the survivor at fault for sexual violence” and discouraging colleges from allowing either party to directly cross-examine the other in investigations. Schools that failed to uphold standards risked losing federal funds.

Colleges responded by creating new Title IX offices and drafting individual policies that varied from school to school. Some universities use hearings; others employ a “single investigator” model, in which a school designee is responsible for both investigating and making a determination. More typical is something like this: After students disclose an assault to a “responsible employee,” that staff member must relay it to the Title IX officer, who determines whether a full investigation is warranted. If it is, the officer taps a staff member or external investigator who has been trained in Title IX procedures to contact the parties, interview witnesses and gather evidence. Complainants are asked to participate, but schools can proceed without them if they decide the claim poses a larger threat on campus. A report is produced that each party can comment on, and panel hearings are held. Until this September, Office for Civil Rights rules stipulated that all of this needed to happen within 60 days, and afterward, the parties could appeal.

Campus reporting of sexual misconduct spiked significantly, and that increase led to an outcry from conservative media, including writers for National Review and Town Hall, which argued that the guidance letter made accusations as good as a verdict. The day the Office for Civil Rights sent its letter, the federal government made “all sex unsafe on campus,” the libertarian magazine Reason said.

The most widespread criticism was that the letter forced schools to lower their standard of proof when assessing claims, to the “preponderance of evidence” standard commonly used in civil lawsuits. Unlike the higher standard used in some civil trials, which require “clear and convincing evidence,” or the highest standard used in criminal trials, which require certainty “beyond reasonable doubt,” preponderance is often described as 50.01 percent certainty of guilt. If an accused student is found more likely than not to have committed the offense, he or she is “responsible,” in the parlance of campus hearings. While there were exceptions before 2011 — schools that used “clear and convincing” or, in a few instances, “beyond reasonable doubt” — preponderance was used in about 80 percent of colleges that had any fixed standard.

Victims’ advocates argued that it followed an established legal principle: In civil cases, where criminal penalties aren’t on the line, the burden of proof is lower. But critics viewed the mandate to use preponderance as a means to finding more accused students responsible, and the standard became a sort of shorthand — that college men were no longer presumed innocent and were being expelled en masse over “regret sex.”

It was an oversimplification, but also one that reflected real problems in the process. To Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a nonpartisan nonprofit that works on free speech, religious liberty and due process in higher education, the larger issue is that the lower standard exists within a “parallel judicial system” that lacks other due-process protections — like the consistent right for attorneys to meaningfully participate in hearings and access to the legal procedures to investigate complex cases. Schools can’t subpoena witnesses to compel relevant testimony or put people under oath; they rarely have access to forensic evidence or processes for discovery.

“O.C.R.’s rationale” was that preponderance of evidence “was the standard for suits alleging civil rights violations like sexual harassment,” wrote Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge and current Harvard law professor, in The American Prospect in 2015. “True enough, except for the fact that civil trials at which this standard is implemented follow months if not years of discovery.” She continued: “It is the worst of both worlds, the lowest standard of proof coupled with the least protective procedures.”

In 2016, FIRE, which had been connecting accused students with lawyers and offering a class to attorneys on handling complaints, put out a recruitment call for plaintiffs to sue the Department of Education over the guidance letter. There was already an abundance of lawsuits against schools — at least 190, according to the men’s advocacy group Title IX for All. Typically, victims’ complaints about mishandled Title IX cases have gone to the Office for Civil Rights, while complaints from accused men land in civil court. In a ruling involving Brown University last year, a Rhode Island judge noted: “A student is not entitled to a perfect disciplinary process, and it is not the court’s role to be an appeals court for Brown’s disciplinary decisions.” At the time, no circuit courts had weighed in, but there were so many cases it seemed one would have to. This September, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did so, finding that the University of Cincinnati violated an accused student’s due-process rights by failing to let him cross-examine his accuser.

With funding from right-wing donors like the Charles Koch Institute, FIRE has often aligned with conservative sensibilities. But a number of academics and lawyers, among them a group of feminist Harvard law professors (including Gertner) who released a public letter in August calling for reform, have cited reasons Title IX policies should concern progressives, too: that overly broad definitions of misconduct, encompassing most drunken encounters, threaten to erode distinctions between consensual and nonconsensual sex; that anecdotal evidence (there’s little hard data available) suggests men of color are disproportionately punished; that a conservative administration could co-opt the campus-rape debate to further its own aims; or that perceptions of bias could trigger a backlash casting women as liars.

“I concede I’ve seen cases where it seems schools were taking shortcuts to justice,” says S. Daniel Carter, a longtime campus-safety expert who consults with colleges and universities about sexual misconduct. But schools that did so, he emphasizes, were violating policy or breaking the law. He points to a September 2017 study released by FIRE that found that most top schools fail to consistently ensure 10 safeguards it considers “fundamental elements of due process” — like providing adequate written notice of allegations and the need for impartial fact-finders. With the exception of two items on FIRE’s list — one calling for a presumption of innocence, which Carter believes violates Title IX’s requirement that adjudicators make no presumptions whatsoever — Carter says not only that he agrees with every principle but also that each is already required by Title IX, the Clery Act or the guidance letter.

In the case of Thomas Rossley, which Andrew Miltenberg joined when father and son decided to sue, the Rossleys contend that Drake violated some of these policies. The school’s acting dean was afforded equivalent speaking time as Thomas and his accuser — effectively doubling the amount of time allowed to make the case against Thomas, which the Rossleys argue is a violation of Office for Civil Rights guidelines. Although Drake’s Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school’s requested time, the dean still spoke. “They basically put in writing: ‘We’re not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,’ ” Rossley says. (In a court filing, Drake denies violating any rules or procedures.)

Victims’ advocates say that cases like this illustrate that the problem isn’t the policy but rather schools’ failing to follow it. A situation where a school gave more time to one party than the other, says Alexandra Brodsky, a fellow at the National Women’s Law Center, would be “both a clear error by the school and points to a need for a more nuanced conversation about Title IX enforcement than ‘Is Title IX good or bad?’ ”

“For my entire career, I’ve seen the pendulum swing,” Carter says. For decades, schools followed “the path of least resistance,” he says, to the detriment of victims. More recently, some followed the same path to the disadvantage of the accused. Now that pattern of reaction and counterreaction is happening at the national level. “It’s not back and forth so much as it’s the same old failed system,” Carter says. “Who is it failing the most today?”

“It’s becoming, I don’t know if ‘circus’ is the right word,” says Laura L. Dunn, the executive director of the national victims’ rights group SurvJustice, but “it’s so legally complex that it’s not an easy thing to step into.” School officials are being named in individual lawsuits, so fewer agree to serve on Title IX panels; self-identified victims increasingly need lawyers of their own, because they risk being sued. Advocates on both sides suspect that schools are hedging their bets as they adjudicate, fearing both lawsuits and Office for Civil Rights sanctions.

In the past six months, two different professional attorneys’ associations have reviewed campus sexual-misconduct policy, and a third’s assessment is underway. They’ve come to different conclusions — one proposing higher standards of proof, another access to all evidence for accused students. The American Bar Association task force’s recommendations led to disputes even within the A.B.A. “I don’t think either side of this issue has advocates that are completely imagining problems,” says Cohn, who admits that no proposed solutions — including FIRE’s — come without costs to either side. “There isn’t a perfect, utopian answer to the problem.”

But under the Trump administration, these complexities are being cast largely as a matter of overregulation. Secretary DeVos, who has argued that local authorities and parents should have greater control over education than the federal government, seems to have taken a similar approach with Title IX. When she had one of her first official conversations about Title IX last April, it wasn’t with national experts on either side, but rather with a combative Republican state representative, Earl Ehrhart of Georgia, who has argued that Title IX enables rampant false allegations and that schools have no business investigating sexual assault. Ehrhart came away from his meeting gratified that DeVos seemed to agree with him on the limited role federal authorities should play. “She’s placing this back where it belongs,” he told me, “in the purview of the states.”

In January 2016, Representative Ehrhart, a former chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which drafts model bills for conservative state legislators, decided, after hearing from the distraught mother of an accused student, to make Georgia the testing ground for challenging the “dear colleague letter.” A conservative with a penchant for bomb-throwing who has been lampooned by a Georgia reporter for delivering “Wagnerian” pronouncements, he began with what he called his “Georgia Tech hearing.” At the time, Georgia Tech had a mandatory-expulsion policy for students found responsible for rape, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that it had expelled or suspended more students for sexual misconduct than any other Georgia state school. It also then used the controversial single-investigator model. Ehrhart, as chairman of Georgia’s House Subcommittee on Appropriations for Higher Education, wielded his financial authority like a weapon, effectively denying Georgia Tech funds to expand its libraries and warning other colleges to be more concerned about losing his support than that of the Office for Civil Rights. “If you don’t protect the students of this state with due process,” he said, “don’t come looking for money — period.” Some victims’ advocates believe he leveraged his role again in pushing the state’s Board of Regents to overhaul its sexual-misconduct procedures. The board announced new rules, including banning the single-investigator model, which went into effect in mid-2016.

That April, Ehrhart and his wife, represented by Miltenberg, sued the Department of Education, challenging the dear colleague letter on the claim that Ehrhart’s stepson, a Georgia Tech student, could “be wrongly accused and found responsible.” Then, early this year, Ehrhart proposed a bill, H.B. 51, which initially mandated that any campus sexual-assault report be forwarded to the police, with or without the complainant’s consent, and forbade schools to take final disciplinary action for any possible felony until there was a conviction or a no-contest plea.

The complexity around campus sexual misconduct has led observers from diverse political backgrounds to call for turning the whole matter over to the police. In a forthcoming law-review article, Brodsky notes that since 2013, at least six states and Congress have considered bills that included some form of law-enforcement reporting. Some mandated that schools refer complaints regardless of victims’ wishes; Congress considered a bill that prevented colleges from proceeding with Title IX processes until the police were at least notified, or in some cases, until a conviction was obtained. But no state bill before H.B. 51 took such an extreme approach — or so flagrantly contradicted federal law. And because state bills cannot override federal law, H.B. 51 seemed intended to force a court challenge to the dear colleague letter.

That, Ehrhart acknowledged, was the point. When we met in Atlanta in March, over Chick-fil-A sandwiches, he said he hoped “Georgia will hang a light on the problem such that the O.C.R., the D.O.E., will be put in a position: ‘Here’s a state statutory enactment that’s 180 degrees different from the old guidance letters. What are we going to do?’ ” Given the Trump administration’s signaling its distance from the dear colleague letter, he wagered that if H.B. 51 passed, the new Office for Civil Rights wouldn’t withdraw federal funds. Then other states would see that they could challenge the letter without repercussion and would follow suit.

The H.B. 51 fight was ugly. Hundreds of student protesters went to the state’s Capitol, where legislators challenged women seeking to testify about their assaults during a preliminary hearing. Ehrhart reprimanded one group of victims, saying: “If you feel triggered, trigger somewhere else.” Men’s rights activists showed up to lobby, at times targeting individual activists. They speculated on social media that one student organizer was a “pretty little liar” and brought to the Capitol a man suspended for having assaulted another.

The backlash Ehrhart mobilized created collateral casualties of its own. In his Georgia Tech hearing, Ehrhart read aloud a letter from the mother of a man expelled after being found responsible for rape. The expelled man had sued, and while his accuser wasn’t a defendant, her name and identifying details were in court documents then available to the public. It was a threat that her attorney, Lisa Anderson, who represents victims pro bono as executive director of Atlanta Women for Equality, feared was a new tactic: essentially outing women who lodged Title IX complaints.

There were threads about her case on the school’s Reddit page; riding a bus across campus, she sat in stricken silence as two students discussed it and decided she had probably made it up. Sidelined by panic attacks, she withdrew from most classes by the end of the semester, and though she tried to return last fall, she ended up leaving again and was hospitalized for a week after becoming suicidal. Her G.P.A. slipped so low that she told me she fears that she can’t transfer elsewhere, and that her only chance to graduate is to wait for the current crop of Georgia Tech students to cycle out.

At Kennesaw State University, one woman found that as the Georgia debate around Title IX grew, her case was caught up in the furor. According to her complaint, early one morning in February 2016, she was raped by a male friend, when consensual fooling around ended in nonconsensual intercourse that she explicitly refused. At first, she told me, she thought her friend had merely “disrespected” her clear line. She let him spend the night, and in the morning they ate breakfast, making plans to meet later. The man didn’t call, and the woman, troubled, talked to friends, who told her she was describing rape. Her mother took her to the hospital and the police, and school officials were informed. K.S.U. started an investigation. (The man denied that they had intercourse.)

But over the summer, as the new Board of Regents policy went into effect, the woman claimed the tone shifted. In her last interview, she says, investigators asked whether she was calling the situation rape because the man hadn’t called. Nonetheless, they found him responsible and recommended a two-semester suspension. (The man’s attorney, Lisa Wells, said the K.S.U. office fell out of touch for nearly five months, leading her client to believe the matter had been dropped.)

In the lead-up to a planned hearing in October 2016, the man argued that the investigation had been biased and hadn’t adequately considered his evidence. He asked that his case be reheard under the new regents’ policy and requested a stay of his decision “until the enforceability of the 2011 dear colleague letter has been adjudicated” — suggesting that Ehrhart’s lawsuit might settle the point. The request for a stay was denied, but the school agreed to have an external reviewer assess the case. When they informed the woman, she received a list of new witnesses for the man’s defense; among them was Ehrhart.

“I had no clue who he was or what he could possibly know about somebody raping me,” she said. “As soon as Ehrhart’s name came up, everything went crazy, and they dropped any care they had for me.” As a representative of K.S.U.’s district, Ehrhart had substantial ties to the school. He co-owned a sprawling sports complex that partnered with the university, and when K.S.U. needed a new president in 2016, Ehrhart championed the appointment of the state’s conservative attorney general, Sam Olens, who served with Ehrhart on the board of a K.S.U. business accelerator.

In the fall of 2016, Lisa Anderson, who represents the woman in the K.S.U. case as well, began to notice that email records K.S.U. sent had redactions in the “cc” line — a third party being kept abreast of the case. After filing multiple records requests, Anderson found emails involving Ehrhart, Lisa Wells and Olens. In one, Ehrhart wrote to Olens: “This is the second of the absolutely ridiculous cases I was concerned about. I label this one ‘breakfast with a rapist’ made for TV absurdity.” He noted he was drafting new legislation to remove such “nonsense” cases from university jurisdiction and his belief that “with a new administration in D.C., the guidance letters are now garbage, and the threat of federal funding is off the table.” In closing, he appeared to request a specific outcome: “I also hope this case can be dealt with in an expeditious manner benefiting its absurdity.”

Olens forwarded the email to the K.S.U. Title IX coordinator. When an external reviewer’s report came back in early 2017 — around the same time Ehrhart introduced H.B. 51 — it reversed the initial decision. (Wells says Ehrhart’s emails could not have influenced the external reviewer’s findings because they weren’t forwarded to her. K.S.U. officials said they were unable to comment on a continuing matter.) When Anderson and the woman appealed in the spring and summer, a process that finally culminated in a hearing this October, the panel declared that both parties were equally credible, so it couldn’t find the man responsible. Even before the verdict, the woman had become so despondent that she decided to withdraw. Wells says her own client is suicidal.

Ehrhart’s bill ultimately failed to pass before the legislative session closed in March, staved off largely by the mobilization of student activists. But if he lost the battle, it would come to seem he had won the war. After DeVos rescinded the guidance letter, he was elated. “We’re back to pre-2011,” he told me. “In many ways, we’ve succeeded.”

“We in the advocacy community, who have been involved with Title IX for decades, understand this is nothing short of a catastrophe,” says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, which in 1977 was one of the first organizations to argue in court that sexual harassment violates Title IX. But the exact nature of that catastrophe is not yet clear. The language in the Office for Civil Rights’s rescission letter and interim guidance is vague enough to allow for different interpretations. It might forbid accusers to appeal. Ehrhart hopes for this but acknowledges that “they didn’t make it crystal clear.” A line criticizing the Obama administration’s failure to let schools rely on law enforcement might allow — or push — schools to relegate complaints to the police. The new Office for Civil Rights interim guidance allows schools to choose between the “preponderance” standard or the higher “clear and convincing,” which could open the floodgates to hundreds of students’ demanding their cases be reheard or bringing new lawsuits. DeVos’s comments have already been cited by a man suing the University of Vermont over his suspension for sexual harassment, noting in his lawsuit: “UVM’s procedures for adjudicating sexual-misconduct complaints is precisely the type of system referenced in DeVos’ statement.” (The university says it is “confident it has acted legally and appropriately.”)

Title IX practices may also start to diverge state to state. While advocates may refute Ehrhart’s suggestion that Title IX is now a state issue — unless Title IX and the Clery Act are overturned, state laws conflicting with them will be challenged in court — they concede that they can’t stop emboldened conservative legislatures from trying.

In the week after DeVos’s speech, a bill sped through California’s Legislature, codifying many of the procedural aspects of the 2011 guidance. Although Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill, citing concerns about due process, Farrell predicted it would be just one among numerous state initiatives. At an October meeting of the State Innovation Exchange, a progressive legislative advisory group, there was discussion of potential Title IX legislation in Colorado, Maryland and Massachusetts; in November, a Massachusetts bill mandating better sexual-assault training for campus staff unanimously passed the State Senate.

Attorneys general will also take on a more active role, says Lizzie Ulmer, a member of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, which sent DeVos an open letter in July urging her not to rescind the guidance and has since held meetings to discuss how states can serve as a stopgap against federal changes. Already, Attorney General Andy Beshear of Kentucky has used his office to sue three state universities for concealing records related to sexual harassment or abuse allegations. “The lawsuits that we’re filing are now more critical than ever,” Beshear says. “If the Education Department is not going to be actively monitoring these investigations by our universities under Title IX, it’s going to take other leaders on the state level.” This could create a situation in which protections for students, on either side of an accusation, vary enormously depending where they live. “One thing we have to think about is it really does become a state jigsaw,” Dunn says. “We have a very polarized political debate, and I think states will come out all over the map.”

Calling campus sexual misconduct a state issue is a short step from calling it an issue of states’ rights. And that’s no accident, say advocates, many of whom have long warned that an attack on Title IX could enable similar attacks on Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act clause that forbids racial discrimination in schools, on which Title IX was modeled. The case law around both is intertwined, Dunn says, and their fates are, too: “If you’re rolling back Title IX, the next thing you roll back is Title VI.”

It’s an argument that some conservatives are already making. Days after DeVos withdrew the guidance, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed suggesting that she shouldn’t stop there but should also withdraw a 2014 guidance concerning the disproportionate suspension and expulsion of black and Hispanic students. The same week, the Federalist Society released a report, written in part by individuals who had been active in criticizing Title IX practices, charging that the Obama Department of Education had overreached on three grounds: the guidance on campus sexual misconduct; a 2016 letter, also under Title IX, mandating transgender students’ access to facilities that correspond with their identity; and the 2014 guidance over disparate suspensions of black and Hispanic students. Given that the first two guidance letters were withdrawn by the time the report was published, the next target seemed clear. The conservative think tank Center for Equal Opportunity, two of whose staff members helped write the report, published a blog post with the headline “Two Down, One to Go.”

One advocate, who asked to remain anonymous to describe a closed-door meeting with the Office for Civil Rights, said that Title VI had come up in conversation with Candice Jackson. “We’ve tried to approach them in good faith,” the advocate said, “and I think they’ve used it to unfortunately learn more of what they could undo.” In October, DeVos rescinded 72 additional Department of Education policies related to the civil rights of students with disabilities, an effort, the department said, to eliminate outdated guidance. A few weeks later, department officials met with a group of educators and advocates calling for the rescission of the third Department of Education guidance letter, on disproportionate discipline of students of color. Among them was the lead author of the section of the Federalist Society report calling for the letter’s rescission. And just before Thanksgiving, the department proposed revising its procedures for investigating school civil rights violations to no longer assess whether an individual reported incident could reveal more systemic discrimination, according to a draft document obtained by The Associated Press.

“This is about ending civil rights protections,” Dunn told me. “This is removing what we had a Civil War over, which really was limiting the states in their ability to violate the rights of individuals. The federal government is meant to be a civil rights check, and states have always retained tons of power to fight that check, but they’re trying to erode even that.”

This November, Equal Rights Advocates held the first leadership meeting of the Initiative to End Sexual Violence in Education, a new national network of attorneys and activists to defend Title IX that will train hundreds of new lawyers, establish a hotline to gather complaints and file suit either against schools failing to uphold Title IX rights or on behalf of those who might come under attack from the new Office for Civil Rights. “If the O.C.R. won’t defend Title IX,” Farrell says, “we will.”

This spring, Miltenberg’s phone rang again. On the line was another mother. “You’re not going to take our case,” she said. “You’re for the other side.”

Her daughter, a freshman at a college in upstate New York, said she had been raped during her first semester, after she was separated from friends at a Halloween party and a man she’d never met grabbed and forcibly kissed her. She said he repeatedly asked her to go to his room, and she repeatedly refused. Later, when she was drunk, he offered to help her find her friends, but he said he needed to stop by his dorm first. Once in his room, she said, he immediately undressed. The woman doesn’t remember exactly what happened next, but she found herself naked on his bed. Then he raped her. When she got up to leave, she said, he told her, “Now go back to your room and don’t hook up with anyone else tonight.”

Weeks later, when the woman was out at a local bar, she felt someone staring at her and saw the man again, standing alone and watching her. Over the course of the night, as she moved from room to room to evade him, he followed, ultimately accosting her on the dance floor. (The accused man denies this account and maintains that the sex was consensual.)

By most campus standards, it seemed like a strong case. The woman had text messages she sent friends the night of the rape, saying she needed help; a female friend of the accused man would testify that she stopped by his room and saw the woman there, looking terrified. The same friend said the man asked her to tell campus authorities that everything looked fine. And the woman went to law enforcement.

After she filed a Title IX complaint last December, the woman and her family moved quickly to comply with the office’s requests, pulling together documentation in the weeks before Christmas and participating in a Skype interview on Dec. 18. But after the woman took a medical leave of absence — she struggled after the assault and was beginning therapy — the school’s commitment seemed to flag. By late January, the woman and her family say, officials hadn’t contacted any of the witnesses she suggested, and the accused student wasn’t interviewed until mid-February. The family decided they needed an attorney of their own. But they found lawyer after lawyer who represented only the accused; no one would take their case.

Miltenberg’s partner warned him that taking the case would be career suicide. But over the previous few months, he had started telling fellow Title IX critics that he didn’t think the dear colleague letter should be summarily withdrawn; perhaps it merely needed to be amended. Far from his earlier suggestion that women who don’t want to involve the police shouldn’t report to schools, he began to believe there was no easy way out of requiring colleges to take action. The police are too overburdened, he said, and some cops too “hard-boiled,” to respond to campus sexual assault well. Miltenberg’s new opinions made him unpopular. “I’m left out of a lot of email chains and phone calls now, and I used to be the lead guy,” he says.

He instructed the family to copy him on their communications with the school. The college’s own investigator was a woman Miltenberg says he contended with in the past, when she aggressively defended schools from lawsuits brought by men. The school allowed the male student to withdraw voluntarily on the eve of his hearing — informing the woman that meant the case was closed. “In any case I’ve ever done, the first thing parents ask is: ‘Can we just pull him out?’ ” Miltenberg says. Uniformly, in his experience, schools said no: The process would proceed, with or without the accused, and with findings of responsibility put on his permanent record. (The school says cases like this would result in a notation on the student’s transcript.) Miltenberg took the case.

When he met with the woman and her family in early June, he was shaken. “It was the first time I’ve ever sat with someone who’s a victim, at least in this type of setting,” he says. “I’m used to hearing the other side in detail and trying to come up with the parts that don’t add up, or where the story doesn’t make sense.” When the woman sent him a diary she kept in the months after the rape — a stream-of-consciousness account of the aftermath of losing control of her body — Miltenberg was aghast. As he read the diary, he imagined the voice of his eldest daughter, the same age as his client, and felt like throwing up. “I read this and think, My God, what if this is what every woman who feels they’ve been sexually assaulted feels like?”

As the woman’s lawsuits begin, she is starting her sophomore year at another university far from her first school. When she notified the New York college, she says, officials seemed almost overjoyed to approve her transfer.

When DeVos rescinded the letter in September, Miltenberg released a statement that did not betray any doubts but instead stated that he was “encouraged” by the action. But when he elaborated to me, he sounded more conflicted. Although he was glad more people were talking about the issue, he said he was “having a bit of a crisis of conscience.” Over the months he had worked on the woman’s case, the conventional wisdom about campus sexual assault had changed, with greater public focus on concerns about due process. “And insanely, I’m one of the people, for better or worse, who had some impact on shifting the narrative.” At the same time, he worried that the rescission could lead to a reaction of its own. He had received nearly a dozen new cases — all decided in the weeks immediately surrounding DeVos’s speech — in which he believed the schools had meted out unduly harsh penalties to make “a political counterstatement.” That prospect was as concerning to him as the school’s inaction on his female client’s case.

“There are real topics in this world that are zero-sum games,” he said; finding a balance between addressing sexual assault and ensuring due process didn’t need to be one. He found himself thinking that advocates on either side of the debate shared a sense of battlefield camaraderie, because only they saw what was really going on. “Sometimes you sit in this hearing and your heart breaks for both people,” he said. “Sometimes I walk out and think the whole thing is a [expletive]: terrible for him, terrible for her, terrible for the parents.” It would be disingenuous, he said, not to acknowledge the concerns of the other side: That if the process is broken, it’s broken at least as much for victims as the accused. That correction can become overcorrection in either direction. The pendulum swings both ways. It shouldn’t, he said, “but I don’t know how to stop it.”",The Takedown of Title IX,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/magazine/the-takedown-of-title-ix.html

For most of the year, people inside and outside Washington have been convinced that there is a strategy behind Mr. Trump’s actions. But there is seldom a plan apart from pre-emption, self-defense, obsession and impulse.

Occasionally, the president solicits affirmation before hitting the “tweet” button. In June, according to a longtime adviser, he excitedly called friends to say he had the perfect tweet to neutralize the Russia investigation. He would call it a “witch hunt.” They were unimpressed.

He has bowed to advice from his lawyers by not attacking Mr. Mueller, but at times his instincts prevail.

When three former campaign advisers were indicted or pleaded guilty this fall, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the investigation, urged the president not to respond. If he did, it would only elevate the story.

Mr. Trump, however, could not help himself. He tweeted that the financial charges lodged against his former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, had nothing to do with the campaign and that investigators should be examining “Crooked Hillary & the Dems” instead. By the next morning, he was belittling George Papadopoulos, the campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his outreach to Russians, dismissing him as a “low level volunteer” who has “proven to be a liar.”

He was calm at first when his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty. The next morning, as he visited Manhattan for Republican fund-raisers, he was upbeat. He talked about his election and the “major loser” in the Senate who had said his tax bill would add to the deficit (presumably meaning Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee).

By Sunday morning, with news shows consumed by Mr. Flynn’s case, the president grew angry and fired off a series of tweets excoriating Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I., tweets that several advisers told him were problematic and needed to stop, according to a person briefed on the discussion.

Once he posts controversial messages, Mr. Trump’s advisers sometimes decide not to raise them with him. One adviser said that aides to the president needed to stay positive and look for silver linings wherever they could find them, and that the West Wing team at times resolved not to let the tweets dominate their day.

The ammunition for his Twitter war is television. No one touches the remote control except Mr. Trump and the technical support staff — at least that’s the rule. During meetings, the 60-inch screen mounted in the dining room may be muted, but Mr. Trump keeps an eye on scrolling headlines. What he misses he checks out later on what he calls his “Super TiVo,” a state-of-the-art system that records cable news.

Watching cable, he shares thoughts with anyone in the room, even the household staff he summons via a button for lunch or for one of the dozen Diet Cokes he consumes each day.

But he is leery of being seen as tube-glued — a perception that reinforces the criticism that he is not taking the job seriously. On his recent trip to Asia, the president was told of a list of 51 fact-checking questions for this article, including one about his prodigious television watching habits. Instead of responding through an aide, he delivered a broadside on his viewing habits to befuddled reporters from other outlets on Air Force One heading to Vietnam.

“I do not watch much television,” he insisted. “I know they like to say — people that don’t know me — they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources — you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don’t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I’m reading documents a lot.”

But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.","Chris Donovan arrived in Flint after the scandal over the Michigan city’s contaminated water supply had been dominating national headlines. He was there, just like dozens of other journalists, covering the crisis. “When I first went, everything I was photographing was really obvious,” he said of his initial trip in 2015. “It was people handing out water, protests and people showering with bottled water.”

But the more he got to know the city and its people, the more frustrated he became with the popular narrative: that Flint was a bad place. So after the city’s turn in the breaking news spotlight, he has returned each year to tell the beleaguered city’s other stories.

He could relate: His hometown, Saint John, New Brunswick, is very much like Flint, with both industry and population shrinking. “I had no idea what to expect,” Mr. Donovan said, other than unemployed factory workers. He did find plenty of idled laborers, but he also found a city greater than the water crisis that still seemed to publicly define it long after the media had moved on.

Mr. Donovan was so dedicated to documenting that lesser-known side of Flint and its people that his friends gently teased him about spending spring break there. Mr. Donovan laughed and said it fits. He could either go back to his hometown in Canada or travel the much shorter five hours to Flint from Toronto, where he lives.

“I’ll continue to go back, and I’ll continue working in Flint probably the rest of my life, just because I have an attachment to the city and the story,” Mr. Donovan says.

His latest story is about the last high school football team in the city, The Jaguars. The team was born from the merger of two schools, Southwestern and Northwestern Academies, and their two teams: the Knights and the Wildcats. It also nods to the athletic history of the city, which has produced dozens of professional football players over the years.

Chris Wilson was one of those. He graduated from Flint Northern in 2000 and went on to play professionally, first in the Canadian Football League and for Washington’s N.F.L. team. He is now back home overseeing the school’s entire program — from 8-year-olds playing flag football to the varsity level playing full-contact.

He has a simple but much-needed mission: To instill hope and purpose in these young men, in much the same way those values were instilled in him.

“By having sports start early, not only do we put out better talent and create a better brand of football, but now kids can know how to go to school and get their work down and strive for a goal,” Mr. Wilson said. Rather than turning to the streets to make quick cash, young people can discover new options and possibilities for a positive life and career though the discipline and teamwork of sports.

The young men of the Flint Jaguars are, by all accounts, resilient and intelligent, growing up hard and playing a hard sport. To earn their trust, Mr. Donovan had to figuratively get off the bench. “A big part of the way that I work is sharing my own experiences with these kids to show them that I’m a human, that I’m not just there to take pictures and leave.”

He played basketball with them and talked with them, and their comfort with him is evident in his photos. Mr. Donovan is invisible on the field and the locker room, and the Jaguars are at ease around him enough to be themselves in their sport and in their emotions, whether those be grief, intensity or exultation. Under the stadium lights, or against the green school bus seats, they show up as young adherents of a beloved American sport.

Just as the rest of Flint has faced tough times, the school struggles financially, to the point that last year the sports program was hanging by a thread. The city is still plagued by toxic water, and off the field the players must contend with the dangers of every day life. But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.

Trey Huddleston gets ready for the homecoming dance while his mother watches; Alone Branch intently works out in the weight room, whether its football season or not. Jalynn Bond is somber one moment, walking through the neighborhood where he lost his brother to gun violence; the next, he’s grinning and flexing at his teammates in the locker room because one of them dared to suggest Mr. Bond was smaller.

As is his habit, Mr. Wilson stands at the center of them (Slide 7), leading a prayer to inspire the team before taking the field. At a game against their rivals, Saginaw High, a brawl erupted between players, and two police officers used pepper spray to break them up. Mr. Wilson and the other coaches restored order and handed out suspensions, but both he and Mr. Donovan criticized the use of pepper spray in ending a scuffle between teenagers, none of whom, Mr. Wilson noted, were being hostile to teachers or coaches.

The program still struggles, just like Flint still struggles. But while Mr. Wilson talks about those challenges and the sacrifices that have been made to keep this program running, he couches it in terms meant to motivate his Jaguars in their daily lives.

“If you haven’t folded already, in a poor city in America, dealing with a water crisis, guess what?” he said. “There’s nothing else out there for you. There’s nothing that’s gonna hit you harder than that.”

Mr. Reed, in a memoir, “Beware of Limbo Dancers: A Correspondent’s Adventures with The New York Times,” wrote that “Speaking Southern was not just a matter of drawl or twang; it meant a different way of framing thoughts.” It meant that he understood the territory, even as he was appalled by the racism and violence that undergirded the suppression of voting rights.

Roy Earl Reed was born on Feb. 14, 1930, in Hot Springs, Ark., and grew up in Piney, in the state’s western Hill Country. His parents were Roy Edward Reed, a grocer, and Ella Meredith Reed. A younger sister, Hattie, died in 1964. In his memoir, he said that working in the store as a boy and talking to a black customer, Leroy Samuels, about the injustice of segregation helped awaken him from “generations of family prejudice lying not quite dormant in my young mind.”

In 1952, he married the former Norma Pendleton, who survives him. Besides his son, John, he is also survived by a daughter, Cynthia Buck, and five grandchildren.

Mr. Reed studied journalism at the University of Missouri, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and worked at The Globe in Joplin, Mo., from 1954 to 1956. From there, he made his way to The Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock, taking time off to continue his journalism studies with a Neiman fellowship at Harvard as a member of its class of 1964.

The Times hired him six months after he returned to The Gazette. He did his first Southern reporting for the newspaper from a base in Atlanta, then moved to the Washington bureau in 1966, covering national politics and the White House.

As a White House correspondent Mr. Reed sometimes took trips with Lady Bird Johnson, often as the only male reporter in a group of 20 or 25. “All of them, including Mrs. Johnson, treated me like one of the girls,” he said.

He returned to the South in 1969 to work from New Orleans, and ended his Times career as a correspondent based in London. He said that he had loved the life of adventure and travel until he didn’t, waking up one morning and not knowing where he was. “I got out of bed and found the hotel stationery and learned that I was in a hotel in Ireland,” he wrote.

After leaving the newspaper, he taught journalism at the University of Arkansas and wrote several books, including “Looking for Hogeye,” essays about the South, published in 1986, and “Faubus: The Life and Times of an American Prodigal,” about Orval Faubus, the former Arkansas governor, in 1997.

His memoir “Beware of Limbo Dancers” was published in 2012. The title, he wrote, came from a message neatly written on the inside of a door in a bathroom stall in the old New York Times building on West 43rd Street.

“This was a style of wit that I had never before encountered,” he wrote. “I suddenly knew that I was a stranger in town — not unwelcome, just a stranger.’’

As a retired reporter he also wrote many advance obituaries about Southern figures for The Times, some of which have not yet been published.

When Mr. Reed first left the South, in 1966, his Times colleagues gave him a trophy of sorts: a wooden stand displaying a soda bottle and a brass plaque bearing the words, “WHERE’S ROY REED?”

America has an acute case of Anglophilia, but it’s a highly selective one. We love “Downton Abbey,” Shakespeare and John Oliver but studiously ignore prawn-cocktail-flavored crisps, Cliff Richard and pantomime. The new Off Broadway show “Jack and the Beanstalk,” presented at the Abrons Arts Center, may help rectify the situation regarding panto, a vaudeville-derived, proudly lowbrow genre that happily endorses an anything-goes approach.

In Britain, pantos are beloved Christmas staples delighting children and adults alike thanks to a cartoonish mix of slapstick, drag, clowning, recycled pop songs, groan-inducing puns and active audience participation; suggestive double entendres are also included for the parents’ benefit.

“Jack and the Beanstalk” was adapted from the fairy tale of the same title by the English actor-musician Mat Fraser (“American Horror Story: Freak Show”), who also plays drums in the two-person band (the music director Meghan Kelleher is at the keyboard); Mr. Fraser’s wife, the neo-burlesque star Julie Atlas Muz, directed. The new show is a stark departure both from their usual work, such as the adults-only “Beauty and the Beast,” and the slick, corporate-flavored entertainment that often dominates the holidays.

“There was something attractive about doing it in a place where there wouldn’t be a whole set of eyes seeing the work and judging it before it’s fully baked,” Ms. Chavkin, who had never been to Edmonton and had never heard of Citadel, said.

Then there was the money.

The American dollar stretches further in Canada. And Citadel was not asking for much — the theater agreed to spend what it usually spends to stage a musical (about $600,000 Canadian) and also agreed not to seek a royalty from future productions (nonprofits that help develop commercial shows often get a percentage of Broadway profits).

The commercial producers would pay the rest of the costs, and bring their own sound and lighting equipment, a revolving stage, and significant set elements to upgrade what they would find at Citadel.

“There was no question it was financially in our interest to go to Canada,” said Ms. Isaacs, who is producing the show along with Mr. Kirdahy, Dale Franzen, and Hunter Arnold.

During just three weeks of rehearsal and four previews, Ms. Chavkin restaged the show several times over, with new cast members, including Reeve Carney (“Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark”), in three of the five main roles. At first, a rail line bisected the stage; the creative team scrapped that design after a single performance. There were several experiments with how best to deploy characters added for the Edmonton production in an effort to bring to life, as it were, those toiling away in hell.

“We’re trying to walk this line between maintaining the metaphorical and poetic world, and also trying to deliver a satisfying story,” Ms. Mitchell said. “The only way we know where it comfortably wants to sit is by going too far in one direction or another.”

The Citadel says that if it worked on a Broadway-aimed show again, it would dedicate a staffer to managing relations with the commercial producers, because immigration and budget issues proved more time-consuming than anticipated.",An Unexpected New Stop on the Road to Broadway: Edmonton,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/theater/an-unexpected-new-stop-on-the-road-to-broadway-edmonton.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

After dark, Mr. Moore rallied supporters in this rural area of southeast Alabama, a near-certain trove of Republican votes. Mr. Jones, who spent his weekend appearing with prominent black Democrats, campaigned in Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama’s two most populous cities, to try to energize urban and African-American voters who would be central to a Democratic victory.

Mr. Jones, a former United States attorney who also needs support from independent and Republican voters if he is to win on Tuesday, tried to balance his get-out-the-vote appeals to Democrats with outreach to people who ordinarily would not consider voting for a Democrat. Indeed, it seemed his most powerful weapon was a Republican: Senator Richard C. Shelby, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, who, in an interview on CNN on Sunday, denounced Mr. Moore and declared that Alabama “deserves better.”

“The people of the state, they have elected Richard Shelby for four decades,” Mr. Jones said of the senator, who has said he wrote in “a distinguished Republican” rather than vote for Mr. Moore. “They’re going to listen to Richard Shelby.”

Mr. Jones also earned an implicit boost, of a sort, from Condoleezza Rice, the Republican former secretary of state and an Alabama native. In a statement issued by her office on Monday afternoon, Ms. Rice called on Alabamians to “reject bigotry, sexism and intolerance” and “insist that our representatives are dignified, decent and respectful of the values we hold dear.”

While Ms. Rice did not mention either candidate by name, and it is unclear how widely her statement will be seen before Election Day, she joined Mr. Shelby in giving a permission slip to wavering Republicans who may be tempted to vote for someone other than a nominee they find intolerable. Some Republicans, echoing Mr. Shelby, have written-in other figures, and a liberal “super PAC,” hoping to starve Mr. Moore of Republican voters who are skeptical of both candidates, has urged write-in votes for Nick Saban, the University of Alabama’s head football coach.

That Mr. Jones is even in a position to benefit from a make-or-break turnout effort is extraordinary by the standards of Alabama, where no Democrat has won an election for Senate or governor in almost 20 years and the party’s statewide infrastructure has crumbled and all but collapsed. A Fox News poll published on Monday found Mr. Jones with a 10-point lead over Mr. Moore, but other recent surveys have found Mr. Moore ahead, and private Democratic polling shows a closer race than the Fox poll suggested.

The campaign’s basic mathematics are widely agreed upon: If Mr. Jones can attract the votes of young people and African-Americans, and peel away a chunk of Republican-leaning whites — particularly women — who recoil from Mr. Moore, then he has a chance to win. Otherwise, the state’s conservative D.N.A. is all but certain to kick in and rescue Mr. Moore from tribulations of his own making.

Mr. Moore, who has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, has been a surprisingly rare sight in public as the campaign nears its end. But he re-emerged at a chandelier-adorned, barnlike building here Monday night in his first public appearance since last Tuesday. The event in Dale County was safe political ground for Mr. Moore, who won 66 percent of the county’s vote in his last statewide general election.

At a rally that featured three conservative firebrands — Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser; David Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis.; and Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas — Mr. Moore’s supporters urged voters to show up on Tuesday.

“This comes down simply to who is going to work the hardest,” Mr. Bannon said at the rally, which, at varying points, included the theme music to “Mission Impossible” and boos at the mention of Mr. Shelby’s name.

Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, later made an emotional appeal on her husband’s behalf, mounting a sustained assault on what she called “fake news” and trying to immunize Mr. Moore from attacks that he disliked women in positions of power, black people and Jewish people.

“One of our attorneys is a Jew,” she said. “We have very close friends that are Jewish and rabbis, and we also fellowship with them.”

Along a road near the event site, protesters gathered to demonstrate against Mr. Moore. Some held signs supporting Mr. Jones, and another placard read: “Real Christians Aren’t Bigots.”

Rural and reliably Republican pockets of east Alabama, like Dale County, could prove to be Mr. Moore’s political salvation. Along a stretch of U.S. Route 431 between Phenix City and Dothan on Monday, signs promoting Mr. Moore were common. Advertisements for Mr. Jones, whose signs fill yards in places like Birmingham and Gadsden, were rare.

Mr. Jones’s strategy does not depend on carrying rural counties that hug Georgia and Florida. Instead, he is hoping to run up significant leads in Alabama’s urban and suburban areas, drawing on traditional Democratic voters as well as Republicans spooked by the allegations against Mr. Moore or a controversial record that predates the Senate campaign.

Speaking briefly at an event space attached to a vintage car showroom in Birmingham, flanked by the basketball star Charles Barkley, Mr. Jones cast the vote as a choice that would define Alabama’s identity.

“It is time that we put our decency, our state, before political party,” Mr. Jones said. Mr. Barkley was more blunt: “At some point, we’ve got to stop looking like idiots to the nation.”

Although Mr. Jones is running against the tides of recent political history in Alabama, Mr. Moore is a deeply divisive figure in the state, where he was, in effect, twice removed as chief justice of the State Supreme Court.

He has a base of supporters whose fervor is the envy of Democrats, as well as plenty of Republicans who have hoped to vanquish him over the years. But should Mr. Moore prevail on Tuesday, he will likely have Mr. Trump, in part, to thank. The president did not visit Alabama after Mr. Moore won the Republican nomination in September, but he repeatedly took to Twitter in support of Mr. Moore and recorded an automated phone message that went out to Republican voters. (For his part, Mr. Jones dispatched automated phone calls from former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.)

Mr. Trump provided Mr. Moore with a crucial seal of approval at a moment of crisis for his campaign, effectively offering reassurance to Republicans who were uneasy about Mr. Moore’s scandals that it was acceptable to vote for him. At a rally last Friday just over the border in Florida, Mr. Trump hailed Mr. Moore as critical to enacting a “‘Make America Great Again’ agenda” in the Senate.

But Mr. Moore’s campaign has been unable to move past the allegations that made the race a close one, and the candidate himself has not made much of a public effort to deliver a pointed closing message.

On Monday morning, Mr. Jones ridiculed Mr. Moore for effectively going underground at the most intense moment in the race. He mockingly alluded to reports that Mr. Moore attended the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia. (Mr. Moore said late Monday that he had taken his wife to West Point to see their son.)

“Here I am once again, surrounded by this gaggle, which I’ve come to love and enjoy, while Roy Moore was not even in the state of Alabama over this weekend,” Mr. Jones said, adding, “When is the last time you’ve heard of a candidate for statewide office leave the state?”","Alabama Senate Race, Unlikely Nail-Biter, Races to Finish Line",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/alabama-roy-moore-doug-jones.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Delanie Walker, a tight end for the Tennessee Titans, offered Keaton and his family tickets to the team’s New Year’s Eve game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. In a short video, he read a poem attributed to Buddha and told Keaton, “You can be whoever you want to be.”

On Monday, as the Facebook posts spread on social media, questions were also raised about Ms. Jones’s motivations in sharing Keaton’s story, but with little solid evidence.

The mixed martial arts fighter Joe Schilling shared a screen shot of an exchange with an Instagram user named kimberlyjones_38 in which the user made a racist remark, but there was no indication that the account actually belonged to Ms. Jones.

By Monday afternoon, both the Instagram account and a GoFundMe campaign that it had linked to had been deleted. A GoFundMe spokesman, Bobby Whithorne, said the campaign had been removed before any money was collected because “the identity of the campaign organizer did not match anyone associated with the family.”

Another GoFundMe campaign, started by a person named Joseph Lam, raised more than $58,000 in two days, but Mr. Lam acknowledged that he had no connection to the family; he wrote in the campaign’s description that he simply “came across” Ms. Jones’s video on Facebook and “felt compelled to help.” On Monday, he suspended the campaign.

Asked whether GoFundMe had verified that the funds already collected would go to Keaton, Mr. Whithorne said the company was working with Mr. Lam to ensure that.

“When a stranger starts a campaign and does not have a direct connection to the individual they’re raising money for, funds are collected by our payment processors, held, and then only released only to the person named as the beneficiary,” he wrote in an email. “All funds are on hold until we’ve received additional information from the beneficiary of the campaign.”

Public attention to bullying tends to come in waves, surging around cases like Keaton’s before falling off again. In some well-publicized cases in recent years, bullying has been so vicious that victims have killed themselves.

Multiple studies, including a 2008 review by researchers at Yale and another published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2014, have found a connection between bullying and suicide.

In his video, through his tears, Keaton told viewers: “If you are made fun of, just don’t let it bother you. Stay strong, I guess.”

Your Liver Doesn’t Know It’s the Holidays Think of your liver as the unindulgent relative at your holiday party who doesn’t like the change in schedule and would rather be in bed.","Jolie Kerr: Reach for the table salt! When you have a fresh red wine stain, pouring an anthill-style mound of table salt on the spill will help to pull it out of tablecloths (or furniture or carpets). Let it sit for several minutes until you notice that the salt is saturated with wine, then brush it away. Much of the stain should be gone, and any remaining wine can be treated later using Wine Away.

TH: O.K., so the tablecloth will be fine, but what if someone spills wine on what he or she is wearing?

JK: The Wine Away will work, but if you don’t have any on hand, flushing the stained part of the clothing with cold running water will at least help to push out a lot of the stain. If you can add some suds to the party, massaging a small amount of dish or hand soap into the stain while flushing it with the water will be even better. If you can’t get to a sink, or just don’t want to walk around with a wet shirt, Shout Wipes are excellent and super easy to stash in a wallet or purse.

TH: Now moving to eating from drinking: What should I do about all of the inevitable grease and gravy stains I’m going to cover myself in?

JK: There are basically two ways you can go with greasy, oily stains: Dab a liquid degreasing product, such as Pine Sol, Lestoil or CitraSolv, on launderable items, or cornstarch for things that can’t go in the wash. (The degreasers can also be used on pots, pans and kitchen surfaces that have gotten splatter-y.) Cornstarch works on grease in much the same way that salt works on red wine: It will absorb it up out of textiles like tablecloths or cashmere sweaters. Lay whatever has gotten greasy on a flat surface, pile the cornstarch on the stain, and let it sit, undisturbed, for 12 to 24 hours before brushing away.

TH: So tomorrow is the first night of Hanukkah. Any specific spill and stain advice for those celebrating?

JK: That grease stain advice will be crucial for those on latke-frying duty. Also, Hanukkah gelt is super delicious, but it also gets melt-y very quickly, which means lots of little chocolate-y fingerprints tend to get on clothes and upholstered furniture. So here’s a quick tip: Shout laundry pretreatment spray is excellent on chocolate stains. Spray the Shout onto the stained fabric and work it in using a damp light-colored rag or sponge — the chocolate will come right out.

TH: What other tips or tricks for the holiday party season can you give us?

JK: If I had to tell people to carry just one thing with them to handle stains on the fly, it would be hand sanitizer. Weird but true. It has a high concentration of alcohol in it, which is a very good stain remover and will work on everything from pen to food spills to blood. Not that you’d need to get blood stains out of anything during the holidays, of course.

JK: Hairdryer to melt, then wipe it up with paper towels.

TH: Lipstick?

JK: Rubbing alcohol, or that hand sanitizer trick I mentioned.

TH: Coffee?

JK: Flush with water and massage a tiny amount of dish soap into the stain, or use a Shout Wipe.

TH: And last: Blood?

JK: Let them bleed out.

TH: O.M.G. Jolie no!

JK: O.K. fine, hydrogen peroxide.

TH: Thank you so much for chatting with me! Any parting words of advice for living clean in 2018, physically or spiritually?

JK: Most people think of cleaning as something they have to do because someone else says so, or shames them into it. If you can flip the script on yourself and think about taking care of your things and your home as a gift you give to yourself, it will make cleaning feel less gruesome and sloggy. And make your bed every day!

The few regulatory disputes that have arisen in Europe have mostly involved big telecom companies that steer users to Facebook and other services.
In Europe, the loophole created a confusing patchwork of interpretations in different countries over whether zero rating violates net neutrality.
But then they get free surfing on Spotify.”Wasn’t net neutrality being compromised?","Europe has sought to combat such practices by adopting net neutrality rules aimed at ensuring that I.S.P.s in the bloc’s 28 member states can’t pick the web’s winners and losers. The regulations are binding and enforced by each country’s national telecom regulators.

For the European Union’s sprawling market of over 500 million citizens, the rules have mostly helped prevent bad behavior.

“There is not a long trail of abuse by telecom operators in net neutrality,” said Philippe Defraigne, a director at Cullen International, a Brussels-based consultant that covers telecoms and the digital economy.

That’s largely because unlike in the United States, Europeans have plenty of choices for internet access at home and on their mobile phones. France has four major mobile and internet operators and nine low-cost offshoots. Britain has more than 50. And there aren’t dominant giants born of megamergers, like the ones between Comcast and NBC Universal, and Verizon and AOL.

Even so, telecom operators in Europe have tried to take advantage of some of the gray areas in the rules.

When Netflix entered the European market in 2012, some national telecom companies forced it to pay “tolls” to deliver content to customers. Netflix did not name the companies but told a regional regulator in a letter that the dispute showed “the importance of strong net neutrality rules.”

The bloc’s rules also left open a major regulatory loophole for a practice called zero rating, in which a mobile network does not charge for data used on certain applications or services, giving them a leg up against competitors. The few regulatory disputes that have arisen in Europe have mostly involved big telecom companies that steer users to Facebook and other services.

Mr. Pai dismantled zero ratings protections in the United States even before he unveiled the plan to undo net neutrality rules entirely.

In Europe, the loophole created a confusing patchwork of interpretations in different countries over whether zero rating violates net neutrality. Sweden’s regulator concluded that the Telia offer didn’t treat internet traffic equally and should be halted. Want to stream music from a scrappy Spotify competitor? Telia would “throttle,” or artificially slow, that service once users reached their data caps, although they could keep listening to Spotify.

That doesn’t necessarily bother consumers.

“From a user perspective, I don’t think it’s a problem and I think most consumers don’t think it’s an issue,” said Magnus Haglunds, a Stockholm-based independent music producer who uses the Telia service. “There are those who may have to change from Apple Music to Spotify. But then they get free surfing on Spotify.”

Wasn’t net neutrality being compromised? “It’s not Cuba,” Mr. Haglunds replied. “Cuba has a problem. There they don’t have any internet at all.”

But the offer alarmed Swedish media companies, which warned that the deal gave Facebook an advantage over competitors, and Telia an edge over other telecom operators.

In February, Indian regulators shut down a separate Facebook zero rating deal with the mobile phone carrier Reliance Communications, saying carriers should not be allowed to “shape the users’ internet experience.”

A Swedish court ultimately overturned the decision on technical grounds after Telia appealed. Telia continues to offer the service in Sweden and other Nordic countries. But Sweden’s administrative court is expected to issue a broader decision on zero rating rules this year.

Critics of the rollback in the United States have cited zero ratings schemes in Europe, or versions of it, as an omen of how the web may be split.

Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, posted a screen grab on Twitter from the Portuguese mobile carrier Meo that went viral. The shot showed basic monthly subscription plans with names like Social, Messaging and Video, each appearing to favor a batch of established apps.

“Providers are starting to split the net into packages,” Mr. Khanna wrote.

In Germany, a similar case involved a Deutsche Telekom offer called StreamOn, which allows users to access unlimited videos and music from specific partners like Netflix. The country’s telecom regulator approved the deal, drawing criticism from consumer activists. StreamOn sought to address some of the concerns by expanding the offer to include around 50 partners.

“This a battle for the next century,” said Klaus Müller, the chairman of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, a lobbying group. “We can either have oligarchical markets with huge players, or a big variety of companies with lots of competition, which would be good for consumers but bad for big business.”

Many in Europe are watching the F.C.C. ruling with trepidation. Over 200 European companies signed a letter to Mr. Pai warning that ending the net neutrality rules will undermine privacy, free speech and competition on the internet.

Robert Beens, the chief executive of Startpage, a Dutch privacy-based encrypted search engine used by surveillence-wary consumers who don’t want their search data recorded, said his company could be put in jeopardy.

Half of the 2 billion searches done annually through Startpage are in the United States. If American I.S.P.s start charging companies to be in the internet’s fast lane, Mr. Beens said he would not be able to keep up with deep-pocketed competitors like Google, Bing and Yahoo.

“People want privacy, but what if we can’t pay the amounts of money that I.S.P.s are looking for?” he said. “In the U.S., people would have a slower connection to our search engine. It could really harm our business model.”

Perhaps the biggest issue for Europe — and other parts of the world — is that countries watch what the United States does.

“The U.S. set good standards for the globe, but now they could go backward,” said Maryant Fernández Pérez, a senior policy adviser at European Digital Rights, an association of civil and human rights organizations advocating an open digital environment.

Later on Monday, and separately, a federal judge in Seattle also ordered a halt to the ban on transgender people serving in the military.

Mr. Trump announced the ban in a series of tweets in July. He said then that he had decided to do so after consulting with generals and military experts, although Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was given only a day’s notice.

Advocates for allowing transgender people in the military said they were not yet ready to declare victory.

“What the ruling signals is that both the Pentagon and the courts have recognized that Trump was stepping out of his lane when he tweeted,” said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, which advocates on behalf of the transgender community in the military.

But, he added: “This could be a long process. We just don’t know what happens next.”

Since Mr. Trump gave the order, the Pentagon has slow-walked it, telling transgender members of the military that they could continue to serve openly while the Pentagon decided how to handle the ban. Last month, the Pentagon paid for gender-reassignment surgery for an active-duty military member.

Staff Sgt. Ashlee Bruce of the Air Force, who began her transition this year, said young transgender troops like her have been on edge in recent months, but noted that even after Mr. Trump announced all transgender troops would be discharged, her commanders and the medical team overseeing her transition continued to reassure her. They cleared the way for her to begin hormone treatments and have her name changed before she leaves for an assignment in South Korea in March.

“Everyone in the leadership kept saying it would be O.K.; they never wavered,” she said. Though she still has to wear a man’s uniform at work, she appeared in a dress for the first time at her squadron’s holiday party last week, with the support of her command.

“It was the first time I could show who I really was, and everyone was so great about it,” she said.

In announcing his ban, Mr. Trump tweeted that American forces could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender service members. But the RAND Corporation, in a 2016 study, found that allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military would “have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs” for the Pentagon.

It estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million, to $8.4 million annually, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. Citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected “little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness” in the United States.

In temporarily blocking the ban in October, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said that the administration’s justification for it was suspect and probably unconstitutional.

Defense Department officials said that new guidelines, a reinstatement of President Barack Obama’s opening of the military to transgender recruits, first reported by The Associated Press, mean that new recruits will have to undergo medical tests before enlisting.

The Obama administration announced last year that the Pentagon would start accepting transgender recruits in the summer 2017, but after taking over the department, Mr. Mattis delayed the policy’s implementation until the beginning of 2018, pending further review.

Last week, the Justice Department asked a federal court to further delay implementation until the court cases involving the ban are resolved.

Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said the way forward “seems very uncertain.”

“Many in the military seem open to the prospect of going forward, but Trump seems very opposed,” he wrote in an email. “It is also possible that the government could allow people to enlist but impose such onerous conditions that few would enlist.”",Transgender People Will Be Allowed to Enlist in the Military as a Court Case Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/transgender-military-pentagon.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Melbourne

Tied Together

By Krystal Ha

Recently, I was on a morning peak hour train in Melbourne, and there was a tall, middle-aged woman sitting down on one of the disabled seats, with a young man in front of her standing up (they didn’t know each other).

After some pointed observation, the woman spoke to the man — asking permission, I suppose. She leaned down and tied the laces on the man’s brogues, as he looked on, smiling.

I was laughing to myself. It was such a motherly thing to do.

Sydney

My Sweet Goodbye

I took this photo on December 28, 2015.

I had just finished my degree and was about to move to Melbourne. This is practically my last memory of Sydney.

I like it because I like to think of Sydney as it is in the photo — maybe too fuzzy sometimes, but always vibrant, hitting you with an unexpected moment of warmth.

Brisbane

Claim Your Onions

By Cecile Blackmore

I was riding the 345 through the northern Brisbane suburbs, my fat sack of groceries bouncing merrily on the vacant seat next to me. While in the city I'd bought myself a treat: a host of ingredients for a spicy laksa soup for one — silken tofu, light coconut milk, bean sprouts, and one loose brown onion.

We passed Normanby, Kelvin Grove, Newmarket … and it was then that my onion went rogue. It slipped out of its packaging and bounced off the seat, under the next one, and began to roll drunkenly up and down the aisle.

Pa-toonk. Pa-toonk.

All eyes turned to me as we pulled in at Alderley and the onion, too, reached its resting position by the driver’s door.

Pa-toonk-clunk!

I detest confrontation and owning up to my mistakes more than anyone, but I knew I had to be brave.

“Excuse me, I … I think that’s my onion!” I hobbled down to collect it like a reluctant fifth-place winner in a raffle.

I’ve done walks of shame before but never one quite like this. I plucked it up and returned to my seat clutching my prize. We drove onward, all vegetables where they were meant to be.

Own your mistakes. Speak up. Claim your loose bus onions.

Dr. Bagnall intervened and asked to see the test, but Dr. Harris refused.
Dr. Bagnall said he was aware of Dr. Harris’s reputation for pursuing and harassing young women.
But even by the standards of the day, Dr. Bagnall said, Dr. Harris’s actions were clearly out of line.
Like Dr. Moss, Dr. Knust said she felt unable to be forthright in her rejection.","“But we are now 30 years later,” she said. “And I do hold Columbia responsible for not doing something about a person whose reputation was widespread. That, to me, is absolutely inexcusable.”

On Oct. 30, four weeks after Ms. Doe filed a lawsuit accusing Dr. Harris of kissing and groping her in 2014, Columbia announced that Dr. Harris, 79, would step down from teaching and other student-related duties. He remains an employee of the university.

Dr. Harris did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for Columbia said administrators were dedicated to making the school harassment-free. “Universities do not exist apart from the widespread re-examination of workplace conduct that has dominated so much of the nation’s attention in recent weeks,” she said in a statement.

Dr. Moss and Dr. Knust are the first women to publicly accuse Dr. Harris and allow their names to be used. They said they decided to come forward after seeing Ms. Doe’s lawsuit. They, along with four other women who declined to be identified, have signed on as witnesses in support of Ms. Doe’s claim that the university turned a blind eye to Dr. Harris’s longstanding pattern of harassment, according to David Sanford, Ms. Doe’s lawyer.

Dr. Moss, now an associate professor at Wayne State University in Michigan, said she never expected Columbia to take action when she was a student.

Dr. Harris’s interest in her developed slowly, she said. During her second year of graduate study, in 1985, he began inviting her to dinner after seminars.

At the dinners, the topics of conversation moved from Roman history to sex in general to her personal life, she said. Dr. Harris never explicitly propositioned her. But she said “there was a constant sexual thing hanging over all of these interactions.”

She did not voice her discomfort outright to him, let alone to any other professors. “He was a very, very important person in the field, and I knew I wasn’t going to get anywhere without his support,” she said.

Her only recourse, she said, was gradually to stop going to dinner with Dr. Harris, and also to begin working more closely with another professor, Roger Bagnall.

Jacqueline Long, another student in the department at the time who is now a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, said she recalled Dr. Moss telling her about her discomfort with Dr. Harris. “She was getting hives and all sorts of allergic stress reactions,” Dr. Long said.

In the fall of 1986, Dr. Moss said, she sat for a Greek language exam, the last exam she needed to qualify for official status as a Ph.D. candidate. Dr. Harris administered the test, then told her she had failed.

Dr. Bagnall intervened and asked to see the test, but Dr. Harris refused.

Now an emeritus professor at New York University, Dr. Bagnall said Dr. Harris’s refusal was unprecedented, as the standard practice for disputed exams was to bring in a second reader.

Eventually Dr. Harris agreed to let Dr. Bagnall see the exam. Dr. Bagnall said that she had passed. So did a third reader, who served as a tiebreaker.

Dr. Bagnall said he was aware of Dr. Harris’s reputation for pursuing and harassing young women.

But he acknowledged that university policies surrounding such behavior had not yet crystallized. He did not report the dispute over the exam to administrators.

Dr. Moss said she would not have expected him or other professors to do so. “I just don’t think at the time there was anything, if they had gone to a dean or provost, that would have happened,” she said.

But even by the standards of the day, Dr. Bagnall said, Dr. Harris’s actions were clearly out of line.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“I think anybody would recognize that there’s a duty of care” between professors and students, Dr. Bagnall said. “And certainly in any situation where you use power against the interests of the student, even in the mid-80s, that just wasn’t acceptable.”

When Dr. Knust, now a tenured professor at Boston University, entered Columbia in the fall of 1993, a university committee had recently published draft guidelines stating that while Columbia was not barring romantic relationships between faculty and students, it was “always the faculty member’s responsibility to interpret with the greatest sensitivity the signals, negative or positive, received from the student and to refrain from exerting any pressure on that student,” according to a Nov. 3, 1993 article in the Columbia Spectator.

“Not taking ‘no’ for an answer may well constitute sexual harassment,” the draft said.

But administrators at the time said they doubted the draft would ever become policy. There was a “disposition not to write out this kind of thing into codes and rules,” Elinor Barber, an assistant provost at the time, told the student paper.

As that policy debate unfolded, Dr. Knust was experiencing a replay of what Dr. Moss said she had experienced a decade earlier: invitations to office hours and cocktail receptions, which turned into private meals.

At a lunch in 1995, Dr. Harris made his affections explicit, inviting Dr. Knust, who was married, to engage in a romantic relationship, she said.

Like Dr. Moss, Dr. Knust said she felt unable to be forthright in her rejection. She laughed off his advances instead, bringing up her husband and children more often in conversation.

“I played the game I learned in seventh grade when a boy likes you,” she said. “You make up some reason so that you protect their feelings, so that they don’t get angry with you, and you still manage to escape. It’s a skill a 12-year-old girl learns that she needs for the rest of her life.”

Dr. Knust said she never felt that Dr. Harris retaliated against her.

She said she told a fellow graduate student about Dr. Harris’s proposition at the time, and a professor several years later. Both confirmed her account.

By the time Ms. Doe began studying with Dr. Harris in 2014, Columbia had codified its stance on faculty-student relationships. “No faculty member shall have a consensual romantic or sexual relationship with a student over whom he or she exercises academic authority,” reads a policy approved by the faculty senate in 2012.

But Ms. Doe said the university paid only lip service to that policy. After she complained about Dr. Harris’s behavior, administrators asked her to avoid him, rather than restricting him from their shared buildings on campus, her lawsuit says; and professors dismissed her concerns, even though they said they were not surprised by them, she said.

Ms. Doe filed her lawsuit just three days before The New York Times published its first article on the allegations against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein.

In the months since, as the country has reckoned with revelations of harassment and assault in entertainment, media and politics, the world of academia has emerged as something of a paradox.

Mr. Sanford said he had seen an uptick in calls from people who said they had been harassed.

But Gayatri Phadke, a graduate student at the University of Connecticut and member of the graduate student union who has worked to negotiate the school’s sexual harassment policies, said students are by definition less likely to feel empowered to speak out against harassment. They are just beginning their careers, dependent upon their professors not only for connections and recommendations but also for their very degrees.

And while universities have often been at the forefront of conversations about gender equity and consent, “Whether you finish your Ph.D. or not is highly dependent on the individuals who are on your committee,” Ms. Phadke said. “And if one of them is the abuser, there’s very little chance that you can successfully stay in graduate school while outing that person.”","At Columbia, Three Women, 30 Years and a Pattern of Harassment",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/nyregion/columbia-university-sexual-harassment-three-decades.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Back Story

Long before there were meatless Mondays, there were meatless Tuesdays, wheatless Wednesdays and porkless Saturdays.

One hundred years ago, during World War I, the U.S. government made an appeal for the country to sacrifice more to help its allies in Europe avoid starvation.

Americans were already encouraged to give up meat (red meat, preserved meat and lard) on Tuesdays and wheat on Wednesdays. The new instructions also excluded pork on Saturday and recommended one meal without meat or wheat each day.

“In this emergency, only the simplest of living is patriotic,” said Herbert Hoover, food administrator and a future president.

In that crucial winter, he said, “lies the period when there will be tested in this great free country of ours the question as to whether or not our people are capable of voluntary individual self-sacrifice to save the world.”

The guidelines were later tightened again, and declared a success.

Another plea to help those struggling in Europe came after World War II. President Harry Truman, in the first televised address from the White House, asked Americans to give up meat on Tuesdays and poultry and eggs on Thursdays.

“We must not fail them,” he said.

The drug money accounts for at least 60 percent of the Taliban’s income, and goes to buy weapons, recruit and pay fighters and conduct operations.

With the war in Afghanistan now in its 17th year, President Trump’s strategy aims to drive the Taliban to a negotiated settlement. It seeks not only to squeeze the group’s opium revenues, but also to increase Afghan army offensives backed by American air power and to hold elections to enhance the Afghan government’s legitimacy.

“The Taliban have three choices: reconcile, face irrelevance or die,” General Nicholson said.

Afghanistan specialists say they have heard such boasts before, and the war is still being fought. They also voiced doubts about the hit-them-in-the-pocketbook plan.

“It’s useful to impact the Taliban financially, but it may just drive production into neighboring Pakistan or Iran,” said David W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general who led the war effort in Afghanistan for almost two years.

Other critics said the sharp increase in airstrikes will backfire, inevitably causing more civilian casualties and the accompanying political blowback, despite the military’s best efforts to mitigate that risk.

“If you increase the number of strikes without allocating the time, personnel and resources to preventing, investigating and acknowledging each one, you get more civilian casualties,” said Daniel R. Mahanty, United States program director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an advocacy group. “It’s basic math.”

Targeting specialists at the military’s air command center in Qatar say they assembled the list of drug facilities that directly finance Taliban insurgents battling the government by examining hundreds of hours of aerial surveillance and poring over intelligence reports. Airstrikes have been carried out at night when fewer people are near the targets.

“It was a very deliberate process,” said Capt. Ryan Pretty, an Army artillery officer who is deputy chief of the team overseeing the bombing campaign’s effects.

Watching and eavesdropping on the scurrying around by drug lab operators whose depots were not hit in the first wave offered important insights for planners drawing up the next set of strikes, helping them map out local Taliban networks.

“These strikes and the aftermath taught us a lot about the complexity of the Taliban’s narcotics operations,” said Navy Lt. William Conway, a former prosecutor in Chicago who is now a lead intelligence officer for Afghanistan at the command center in Qatar.

Central to both the antidrug and troop-protection operations are the B-52’s. They are the latest chapter in the storied bomber’s history over the past six decades, from its carpet-bombing missions in the Vietnam and 1991 Persian Gulf wars, to its strategic role as part of the country’s nuclear deterrent. In January, B-52’s will deploy from Louisiana to Guam for duty in the Pacific, including near North Korea.

Of the roughly 750 B-52’s originally built, the Air Force is still flying about 75 of the sweptwing, eight-engine H-model planes. The aircraft I flew on, nicknamed Night Train, was built in 1961, making it nearly twice as old as any of its five crew members from the 69th Bomb Squadron out of Minot Air Base, N.D.

Our mission began before 5 a.m. at the squadron headquarters at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where the crew received a series of intelligence, safety and mission briefings. Following bomber tradition, the crew then sprayed on cologne (a very pungent “Extreme Liberty” for this mission).

In the pre-dawn darkness, a bus ferried the crew to its jet, its engines running, bombs hanging off its massive wings. Crew members clambered up a metal ladder into the fuselage. The two weapons officers — Soar, 30, from Pittsburgh, and Will, 28, from Arcadia, Calif. — sat in front of glowing screens in the cramped, windowless offensive operations compartment.

Up another metal ladder was the cockpit and a separate cramped, windowless space for the electronic warfare officer — Poppa, 28, from San Diego. The mission commander, Rage, 29, from Minden, Neb., and his co-pilot, Bravo, 26, from Hillsborough, N.J., ducked down an aisle and shoehorned themselves into their seats in the cockpit, while strapped into oxygen masks, flight suits, flight vests and ejection seats with parachutes. I sat in an instructor pilot seat behind Rage.

The crew members asked to be identified only by their call signs or first names for security reasons. It is a young crew, with only one member, Soar, having previously deployed overseas. One of a dozen crews in the squadron, this was their 23rd mission to Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria since arriving in September.

At 5:41 a.m., with the reddish dawn seeping across the horizon, the B-52 lumbered down the runway and roared off on the 3 and a half-hour flight to southern Nangahar Province in eastern Afghanistan, where Taliban and Islamic State fighters are battling with Afghan army troops for control.

Once there, with jaw-dropping views of 16,000-foot, snow-capped peaks out the tiny cockpit windows, the crew received instructions from Special Operations forces working with Afghan troops on the ground to use their high-powered camera sensors to spy on several buildings in a village compound, and look for any “nefarious” activity.

In this case, the B-52 was acting as an airborne cavalry, ready to rush to the aid of friendly forces with a formidable arsenal that included about two dozen 2,000-pound and 500-pound laser-guided bombs — more than 10 tons of destruction in all.

Inside the B-52, affectionately known as a Buff (as in “Big, Ugly, Fat,” followed by an expletive), the noise was deafening. Crew members wore headphones and talked over microphones. Thirteen hours is a long time in a very confined space, and the crew has tricks to stay alert, including energy drinks and lots of caffeine. An eclectic mix of heavy metal, rock, country and rap music blared through their headphones.

For six hours, the B-52 flew tightly banked routes to give Soar the best view of his potential targets. Black-and-white images flickered across his screen: A man chopping wood. A woman doing laundry. Suddenly, he spotted something suspicious: a man pulling a long cylindrical object out from under a tarp. Was it just a long piece of wood or pipe, or was it a surface-to-air missile?

Taking no chances, Rage and Bravo veered the plane out of missile range, and called for an armed Reaper drone nearby to take a closer look. After nearly an hour and some delays, the B-52 needed to turn back to base without resolving the minor mystery.

No bombs were dropped that day, as has been the case on about a quarter of the crew’s so-called overwatch missions to protect Afghan troops. “But the good guys got home safely,” said Rage.","Hunting Taliban and Islamic State Fighters, From 20,000 Feet",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/world/asia/taliban-isis-afghanistan-drugs-b52s.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Some in the sport wondered if the Norwegians were playing mind games with their competitors. In speedskating, posturing is as common as actual technological progress.

“I look at that as the oldest trick in the book,” Mike Crowe, the coach of the Canadian team, said about the color switch and ensuing intrigue. “It’s just gamesmanship, really. Make them doubt. Make them wonder.”

In a fireside interview at the rink, Havard Myklebust, the sports scientist leading Norway’s secret suit development effort, seemed amused at the attention the uniforms had garnered over the past few weeks. He hinted that overeager Norwegian journalists might have played a role in the proliferation of this new color theory.

And still, he seemed content to let the speculation simmer. He demurred when asked whether his team’s research had shown color alone could affect the aerodynamics of a material. He stuck to tantalizing generalities.

“What I’ve said is, our new blue suit is faster than our old red suit,” he said with a tight smile, “and I stand by that.”

Skaters, for the sake of their sanity, seemed disinclined to pay too much attention to the subtleties of a suit. Still, they acknowledged that confidence, in oneself and one’s gear, was crucial. Feeling fast can help you go fast.

The psychology of a suit, then, can be just as important as its physics.

Stephen Westland, a professor of color science at the University of Leeds in England, said that despite the implausibility of a link between color and suit physics, a large body of research showed that color could affect performance from a purely psychological standpoint.

“Sporting participants wearing some colors may feel more confident or powerful,” Westland said. “And opponents may infer qualities about their opponents that depend upon which colors they are wearing.”

The Olympics in South Korea will be the first time Norway’s speedskaters will wear proprietary uniforms rather than suits from a mass producer. Myklebust said the overall goal of his two-year project, nicknamed Top Speed, was to engineer a suit that could subtract eight one-hundredths of a second per lap.

It may be too early to tell whether the Norwegians achieved that goal — or whether their new blue uniforms have made them faster. But for what it’s worth, a Norwegian skater, Havard Holmefjord Lorentzen, was leading the men’s overall World Cup standings last week.

“We just decided we needed to take a bit more responsibility for our racing suits than just buying them from a supplier somewhere,” said Jeremy Wotherspoon, the sprint coach for the Norwegian team.

That seemed fair enough, but there were more pressing questions: What about the color?

Wotherspoon smiled, unfolded his arms and pointed to the hat he was wearing, which bore the logo of a Norwegian seafood company that sponsors the team. It was a familiar shade of blue.

“That could have something to do with it,” he said.",What’s the Fastest Color? Olympic Speedskaters Now Say Blue,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/sports/olympics/fastest-color.html

Credit Brynn Anderson/Associated Press

There are times in life when the institutional ground underneath you begins to crumble — and with it, longstanding attachments. Such is the case for me when it comes to the Republican Party and evangelicalism.

I’ve been a part of both for my entire adult life. These days, though, in many important ways they are having harmful effects on our society.

The latest example is in Alabama, where Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate, stands accused of varying degrees of sexual misconduct by nine women, including one who was 14 years old at the time. Mr. Moore leads in most polls, and solidly among most evangelicals, heading into Tuesday’s election.

A bit of personal history may be in order here. As a young man I embraced conservatism as a political philosophy and the Republican Party as its political home. The first vote I cast was in 1980 for Ronald Reagan. I had spirited debates with classmates at the University of Washington in Seattle, which was hardly a hotbed of conservatism. They couldn’t begin to understand what I was doing. Yet I was proud to make the case for Reagan and consider myself fortunate to have worked in his administration in its second term.

At roughly the same time, I was in the midst of a pilgrimage of faith that started as vague deism but eventually led me to evangelicalism. Both the Republican Party, which was created to end slavery and preserve the Union, and evangelicalism, a transdenominational effort to faithfully represent Christ in word and deed, shaped my life and outlook, helping me to interpret the world.

Politics and faith are hardly synonymous. They occupy different realms, and my faith has a far more important and cherished place in my life than politics. Yet both are significant to me, and the two spheres are not entirely distinct.

Some of the most impressive moral movements in American politics — the efforts to abolish slavery and to end segregation and the struggle to protect unborn life — have been informed by Christianity. Two of the monumental figures in the latter half of the 20th century, Reagan and Pope John Paul II, together helped to bring down one of the most malevolent political movements in history: Soviet-led Communism.

More recently, the global AIDS and malaria initiative is one of President George W. Bush’s greatest legacies; more than 13 million people are on lifesaving antiretroviral treatment as a consequence. This, too, was a policy that came about in response to human sympathies that were shaped in large part by the faith of Mr. Bush and some of his key advisers.

I don’t mean to imply that politics and religion are a perfect fit. Often they’re not, and over the years Christians, myself included, have not gotten the balance right. But overall I felt that the Republican Party and the evangelical movement were imperfect forces for good, and I spent a large part of my life defending them.

Yet the support being given by many Republicans and white evangelicals to President Trump and now to Mr. Moore have caused me to rethink my identification with both groups. Not because my attachment to conservatism and Christianity has weakened, but rather the opposite. I consider Mr. Trump’s Republican Party to be a threat to conservatism, and I have concluded that the term evangelical — despite its rich history of proclaiming the “good news” of Christ to a broken world — has been so distorted that it is now undermining the Christian witness.

Just the other day I received a note from a friend of mine, a pastor, who told me he no longer uses the label “evangelical” to describe himself, even though he meets every element of its historical definition, “because the term is now so stained as to ruin my ability to be what evangelicalism was supposed to be.”

Another pastor who is a lifelong friend told me, “Evangelical is no longer a word we can use.” The reason, he explained, is that it’s become not a religious identification so much as a political one. A third person, who heads a Christian organization, told me the term evangelical “is now a tribal rather than a creedal description.” In October, the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship, a campus ministry for more than 80 years, changed its name to the Princeton Christian Fellowship. “We’re interested in being people who are defined by our faith and by our faith commitments and not by any sort of political agenda,” according to Bill Boyce, who has led the campus group for decades.

There are of course a great many honorable individuals in the Republican Party and the evangelical movement. Those who hold different views than I do lead exemplary lives. Yet I cannot help believing that the events of the past few years — and the past few weeks — have shown us that the Republican Party and the evangelical movement (or large parts of them, at least), have become what I once would have thought of as liberal caricatures.

Assume you were a person of the left and an atheist, and you decided to create a couple of people in a laboratory to discredit the Republican Party and white evangelical Christianity. You could hardly choose two more perfect men than Donald Trump and Roy Moore.

Both have been credibly accused of being sexual predators, sometimes admitting to bizarre behavior in their own words. Both have spun wild conspiracy theories, including the lie that Barack Obama was not born in America. Both have slandered the United States and lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, with Mr. Moore declaring that America today could be considered “the focus of evil in the modern world” and stating, in response to Mr. Putin’s anti-gay measures in Russia: “Well, maybe Putin is right. Maybe he’s more akin to me than I know.” Both have been involved with shady business dealings. Both have intentionally divided America along racial and religious lines. Both relish appealing to people’s worst instincts. Both create bitterness and acrimony in a nation desperately in need of grace and a healing touch.

I hoped the Trump era would be seen as an aberration and made less ugly by those who might have influence over the president. That hasn’t happened. Rather than Republicans and people of faith checking his most unappealing sides, the president is dragging down virtually everyone within his orbit.

In the latest example of this, a rising number of Republicans are attempting to delegitimize the special counsel’s investigation into whether there were links between Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Mr. Putin’s Russia because they quake at what he may find. Prominent evangelical leaders, rather than challenging the president to become a man of integrity, have become courtiers. What’s happening with Mr. Moore in Alabama — with the president, the Republican National Committee, the state party and many white evangelicals rallying around him — is a bridge too far for many of us. Where exactly is the bottom? And at what point do you pull back from associating yourself with a political party and a religious term you once took pride in but that are now doing harm to the things you treasure?

Institutional renewal and regeneration are possible, and I’m going to continue to push for them. But for now a solid majority of Republicans and self-described evangelicals are firmly aboard the Trump train, which is doing its utmost to give a seat of privilege to Mr. Moore. So for those of us who still think of ourselves as conservative and Christian, it’s enough already.

We were trained to meet veterans in their moments of crisis to provide a comforting presence and a listening ear. But as my year there came to a close, I felt that I’d provided little comfort to many of the morally injured veterans I’d met.

In her book “Afterwar,” the philosopher and military ethicist Nancy Sherman highlighted the problematic disconnect between the American public and its military and veteran community. The disinterest among civilians in the wars being waged, she observed, had effectively cut off veterans with moral injuries from the wider community that could justify or sanction the acts they were asked to commit. (That disinterest was expressed cynically in Congress by the House leadership’s refusal to entertain an amendment to rescind and renegotiate the authorization of military force in effect since 2001.)

In treating veterans with moral injuries, the ethical dilemmas that cause their traumas are often ignored. Clinicians tend to focus on addressing the symptoms; therapists and chaplains — myself included — tend to focus on veterans’ regret and desire for forgiveness. But forgiveness may not be the balm that so many believe will make these veterans whole again. So what could recovery from moral injury look like?

Just over a century ago, a philosopher named Josiah Royce was engaged in important work that may provide us with an answer. Royce was a member of the storied Harvard philosophy department of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One principle that Royce explored was loyalty — the commitment to a community and a cause that will (ideally) give rise to a rich and moral life. He claimed that moral actions should be understood in terms of their relation to an ideal, like friendship or patriotism, that is also always shared with others in a community.

Soldiers provide a good example. They are loyal patriots, serving their country in wartime, but also committed to protecting their fellow soldiers. But this is only one loyalty among many that a soldier may have — to family, God, the Yankees, or to ideals like freedom and justice. How can a soldier be loyal to the cause of family — and by extension, to the nearly universal community of those who share this loyalty — as he fires his weapon at an Afghan family’s hut? How can he be loyal to the ideals of integrity and honor in war while acting in ways that defy those ideals?

Soldiers often describe the traumatic events connected with moral injury in terms of split loyalties — of having to make the impossible decision of betraying one ideal for another. The reality of these choices, according to Royce, is that in these decisions, we still answer for this betrayal with the penalty of moral injury. Royce appreciated this tragic aspect of the moral life: Betrayals aren’t easily fixed or forgiven. “The fact that I am the one who then did thus and so, not ignorantly, but knowingly,” he wrote, “that fact will outlast the ages. That fact is as endless as time.” Royce called this the “hell of the irrevocable” — the tragic inability of humans to have a “do-over” in life.

Royce’s philosophy of loyalty offers a different way for clinicians and concerned citizens to think about what is really at stake for veterans. Moral injury, seen through Royce’s lens, is less a matter of violating some deeply held moral norm and more a matter of choosing one profoundly important loyalty over another. This is the root cause of the tragic quality of a rich and fully loyal life: “We never completely win the union; we never realize to the full the one loyal life; but insofar as we are loyal, we win enough of this unity of life to be able to understand the ideal, and to make it our own guide.”

Why can’t these disloyalties be forgiven? At best, forgiveness serves only as a kind of amnesia. Even if the action could be forgiven by the offended party, what would this forgiveness mean? That the act had not been committed? Seeking forgiveness is like tossing a snowball into the hell of the irrevocable. Royce thinks that there is, however, another way. Instead of forgiveness, Royce proposes that atonement — proving one’s loyalty to the cause and community that have been betrayed — is the only way to regain one’s moral self and restore the moral integrity of the community.

What is atonement? A creative act of compensation or recompense that attempts to unify something that has been torn apart. Deeds of atonement, according to Royce, are meant not to win forgiveness but to enrich the life of the betrayed community — and by extension, to bring something good out of disloyalty. “The deed of atonement,” Royce admonishes, “shall be so wise and rich in its efficacy that the spiritual world, after the atoning deed, shall be better, richer, more triumphant amidst all its irrevocable tragedies than it was before.”

So let’s get concrete: The focus for those who suffer from moral injury (and those who care for them) should shift from forgiveness to creative deeds of atonement. Some veterans’ organizations provide such opportunities, even if they don’t adopt this language explicitly. Team Rubicon, for example, gives veterans and civilians a new mission by helping communities in distress overcome disasters and disadvantages. But volunteer opportunities are not the only or even the best sites for deeds of atonement. After all, moral injury often extends to children and families.

Recovery from moral injury begins with identifying the causes and communities that were sacrificed in the heat of battle and finding creative new ways to re-establish loyalty to those causes. This can mean renewing one’s commitment to being a good parent, serving the needy in one’s community or taking political action to stem the flow of American lives into war zones that lead to moral injury. Focusing on atonement rather than forgiveness may help clinicians, community members, families and friends of veterans who suffer from moral injury begin to chart a path forward from the irrevocable deeds that haunt them.","For Veterans, a Path to Healing ‘Moral Injury’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/opinion/for-veterans-a-path-to-healing-moral-injury.html

(The department’s inspector general is investigating what actually happened, because Mnuchin repeatedly claimed to have such an analysis in hand.) If the experts actually did do an analysis, they probably found what everyone else has found — namely, that tax cuts come nowhere near to paying for themselves.

In that case, however, how does Mnuchin manage to claim otherwise? Here’s how the report describes the process: “O.T.P. has modeled the revenue impact of higher growth effects, using the administration projections of approximately a 2.9 percent real G.D.P. growth rate over 10 years.” Notice the carefully deceptive wording. A casual reader might think that O.T.P. is predicting 2.9 percent growth — but what this actually says is that Trump officials simply told the office to assume high growth.

And the assumed acceleration in growth, which comes out of nowhere, is extremely high. It’s many times higher than the Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate, which is itself more optimistic than other estimates. No model I know of, not even those of conservative tax-cut advocates, would predict this much payoff.

In other words, this “analysis” is a sick joke. Why would Mnuchin think he can pull off this scam?

As I said, he probably can’t. But he may be inspired by the example of Paul Ryan, who pulled off similar scams a few years back, fooling much of the news media and even receiving an award for fiscal responsibility from several deficit-scold organizations.

The details of Ryan’s scam were a bit different, but the basic principle was the same. First, tell budget experts to make obviously unrealistic assumptions and estimate what those assumptions would mean for future budget deficits. Then tout the resulting estimates as validation of your plan.

In Ryan’s case the unrealistic assumptions involved revenues and spending, not growth: He simply told experts to assume that he could cut taxes without losing revenue by closing unspecified loopholes, and that he could achieve drastic cost savings without specifying which programs would be cut. And the budget experts were the staff at the Congressional Budget Office, not the staff at Treasury. But the result was the same: Potemkin budget projections that looked great to the casual observer, but had nothing real behind them.

Oh, and the howling mess that is the current G.O.P. tax plan shows what happens when Ryanesque pretense meets reality.

Yet Ryan’s scam worked. He received years of media adulation; that adulation is the main reason he’s now speaker of the House. Even now, news analyses tend to depict the irresponsibility and incompetence of Republican tax plans as some kind of deviation from Ryan’s past behavior, not its natural continuation.

In fact, you almost have to feel sorry for Mnuchin: Yes, he’s an obvious buffoon, but his scam isn’t really any worse than Ryan’s. Why can’t he pull it off?

The larger point is that the dishonesty and dysfunctionality of current Republican efforts at tax “reform,” the party’s evident inability to govern in a serious way, didn’t come out of nowhere. Republicans have been heading in this direction for years.

“All three come from filmmakers with something important to say — uncompromised, singular, strong, auteur voices,” said Stacey Snider, Fox’s movie chief. “I’m proud that we have differentiated ourselves as a place for that kind of filmmaking.”

The other nominees for best drama were “Dunkirk,” Christopher Nolan’s World War II epic, and the romance “Call Me by Your Name.” Voters also gave Mr. Nolan a directing nod but unexpectedly disregarded the “Call Me by Your Name” filmmaker Luca Guadagnino.

Long seen as the most unserious stop on Hollywood’s awards circuit, the Golden Globes are handed out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of mostly freelance journalists, only 89 of whom vote. Studios see members as easy to manipulate, a reputation the group contends is long outdated. (A lawsuit in 2011 alleged payola and kickbacks. The organization settled out of court.)

And top prizes are split into dramatic and comedic categories, often in confounding ways. This time around, the satirical horror film “Get Out” was nominated in the best musical or comedy category. (Its backers at Universal submitted it there, hoping to improve its chances, creating an internet brush fire last month.) “Get Out” will compete against the P.T. Barnum musical “The Greatest Showman”; the figure-skating dark comedy “I, Tonya”; the movie-about-a-movie “The Disaster Artist”; and Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age comedic drama “Lady Bird,” which drew four nominations.

But timing is everything in show business, and Academy Award voters (some 8,400) cannot help but pay attention to the Globes. The 75th Globes ceremony will be hosted by Seth Meyers and broadcast live on NBC on Jan. 7. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce Oscar nominations on Jan. 23.

Among television categories, HBO’s “Big Little Lies” emerged as the one to beat on Monday, taking six nominations, including for best limited series and all four of its actresses — Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in the lead category and Laura Dern and Shailene Woodley in supporting. “Big Little Lies” helped push HBO to 12 total nominations, the most of any television network.

Netflix was second with nine, including best drama nods for “The Crown” and “Stranger Things.” Other best drama candidates were the usual suspects: “Game of Thrones,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “This Is Us.” Best comedy nominations went to “Will & Grace,” “black-ish,” “Master of None” — all expected — and two new series: “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” on Amazon (the latest from the “Gilmore Girls” creator Amy Sherman-Palladino) and “SMILF,” a Showtime series that stars Frankie Shaw as a working-class single mother in Boston.

The nominations were announced by Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell and Sharon Stone in a pre-dawn presentation at the Beverly Hilton Hotel timed for the East Coast-based morning news shows. The press association handed out Champagne before 5 a.m. Pacific Time to toast the 75th anniversary of the awards.

This movie, which looks at Mrs. Graham’s role in publishing the Pentagon Papers, has been trying to hang back: It won’t arrive in wide release until Jan. 12. But early buzz has been strong — the National Board of Review named it the best film of the year — and Globes voters turned it white hot with nominations in the big four categories: best drama, director (Steven Spielberg), actress (Meryl Streep) and actor (Tom Hanks).

“The Post” also picked up nominations for its screenplay, written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the score by John Williams.

Recognition for ‘All the Money in the World’

Because the press association gives a prize for best drama and best comedy, Hollywood often looks to directing nominees for clues about what film truly rose to the top at the Globes. Joining Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Nolan and Mr. del Toro were Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed “Three Billboards,” and Mr. Scott, who abruptly reshot portions of his kidnapping thriller “All the Money in the World” after one of its original stars, Mr. Spacey, became embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal.

Mr. Spacey’s replacement, Christopher Plummer, received a nomination for his supporting role. In a surprise, Michelle Williams, who stars in “All the Money in the World” as the desperate mother of J. Paul Getty III, who was kidnapped in 1973, was nominated alongside Ms. Streep, Ms. McDormand and Ms. Hawkins as best dramatic actress. Jessica Chastain (“Molly’s Game”) filled out that category.

A Diverse List of Nominees

If you trust the handicappers at Gold Derby, an entertainment honors site, this year’s Academy Award nominations could be #OscarsSoWhite all over again. The prognosticators indicate there’s a possibility that only the supporting actress category would feature an actor of color: Mary J. Blige, for her sagacious matriarch in “Mudbound,” a Netflix drama about racial tension in rural Mississippi in the 1940s.

She received two nominations on Monday — the second for contributing lyrics to a “Mudbound” song — and was joined in the best supporting actress category by Hong Chau, a scene stealer in the social satire “Downsizing,” and Ms. Spencer, a former Oscar winner who plays a brash janitor in “The Shape of Water.”

Daniel Kaluuya, who helped propel “Get Out” to box-office heights, was nominated for best actor in a musical or comedy. Denzel Washington got a best drama actor nod for his offbeat lawyer in “Roman J. Israel, Esq.”

The press association has worked hard in recent years to jettison its reputation for oddball nominations that were interpreted more as efforts to populate its televised banquet with stars than honor the year’s best performances. The list on Monday contained no outright embarrassments. But there were some nods that assured pretty young faces: Ansel Elgort, an acting nominee for “Baby Driver,” for instance.

Foreign film nominees were Angelina Jolie’s “First They Killed My Father” (Cambodia), “A Fantastic Woman” (Chile), “In the Fade” (Germany and France”) “Loveless” (Russia) and “The Square” (Sweden, Germany and France).

Old and New Recognized in TV

Globes voters like to make agenda-setting choices with their television awards. They paid early attention to “Transparent,” “Mr. Robot” and “The Crown,” helping to catapult those series into the cultural firmament. But Emmys voters may have beaten them to the punch this year.

At the most recent Emmy Awards, multiple trophies went to rookie shows like “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Big Little Lies,” both of which received numerous Globes nominations.

But Globes voters also bestowed multiple nominations on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “SMILF.” They even found ways to throw attention toward the new ABC hit “The Good Doctor,” which has received middling reviews, honoring its star, Freddie Highmore, in the best actor category. Joining him is Jason Bateman — nominated for his work in the new Netflix crime series “Ozark” — Sterling K. Brown (“This is Us”), Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) and Liev Schreiber (“Ray Donovan”).",‘The Shape of Water’ and ‘Big Little Lies’ Lead Golden Globe Nominations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/movies/golden-globes.html

Egan’s immensely satisfying new novel, the follow-up to “A Visit From the Goon Squad,” which won a Pulitzer Prize, is a dreadnought of a World War II-era historical novel, bristling with armaments yet intimate in tone. It primarily tells the story of Anna Kerrigan, a young woman who works at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where women have been allowed to hold jobs that belonged only to men. This is an old-fashioned page-turner, tweaked by this witty and sophisticated writer so that you sometimes feel she has retrofitted sleek new engines inside a craft owned for too long by James Jones and Herman Wouk. (Read the review.)

‘SUNSHINE STATE: ESSAYS’ By Sarah Gerard (Harper Perennial). Thanks to books by John Jeremiah Sullivan (“Pulphead”) and Leslie Jamison (“The Empathy Exams”) and a handful of other young writers, the essay collection has new impetus and drama in American letters. Gerard’s book deserves to be talked about in this company. One of its themes is the way Florida can unmoor you and make you reach for shoddy, off-the-shelf solutions to your psychic unease. This book’s first essay, in particular, is a knockout, a lurid red heart wrapped in barbed wire. It’s about the author’s intense friendship with a girl who grew up to be a stripper and spend time in women’s shelters, and it has the sinister propulsion of a Mary Gaitskill short story. (Read the review.)

‘STICKY FINGERS: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JANN WENNER AND ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE’ By Joe Hagan (Knopf). Wenner is said to regret his decision to choose Hagan to be his biographer, but from this reader’s perspective his bet paid off: Hagan has delivered a graceful, confident, dispassionately reported and deeply well-written biography. It’s a big book, one that no one will wish longer, but its chapters move past like a crunching collection of singles and not a thumb-sucking double album. It’s a joy to read and feels built to last. (Read the review.)

‘THE ANSWERS’ By Catherine Lacey (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). Lacey writes sentences that are long and clean and unstanchable. They glow like the artist Dan Flavin’s fluorescent light tubes. In this, her second novel, she sweeps you up in the formidable current of her thought and then drops you down the rabbit hole. On a certain level, this is a dystopian project; it borders on science fiction. It’s about a young, underemployed and ill young woman, and how she is slowly drawn into an experiment that involves facial recognition software and electromagnetic pulses that can make a person weep or flush. It’s a warm-blooded yet brooding novel about the neurobiology of love. It casts a spell. (Read the review.)

‘CLASS’ By Francesco Pacifico (Melville House). Pacifico’s second novel is as bitter and strange as a glass of Fernet Branca. It’s about young, wealthy, amoral Italian hipsters in Manhattan and Brooklyn circa 2010, and it is the work of a forceful and ambitious writer. The novel is a manifesto of contempt and its deformed twin, self-loathing. It’s about young people who flicker across the globe, tucked under blankets and Beats headphones in first-class airplane seats, coasting on the dwindling remains of their trust funds. This book both attracted and appalled me when I first read it, and those feelings still hold true. But I find this novel has stuck with me in ways that ostensibly “better” ones have not. (Read the review.)

‘HOME FIRE’ By Kamila Shamsie (Riverhead). Shamsie’s new novel, which was longlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, is a bold retelling of Sophocles’ “Antigone.” It begins with the airport interrogation of a young Muslim woman who has come to the United States to study, and Shamsie dilates throughout on Sophocles’ themes: civil disobedience, fidelity and the law, especially as regards burial rights. The author is shrewd and funny, but this novel pushes past tragicomedy into darker areas, including the appeal of ISIS for some young men. Hold tight for its final scene, which is the most memorable of any novel I read this year. (Read the review.)

‘AUTUMN’ By Ali Smith (Pantheon). Smith has a beautiful mind. Her new book, the first of an anticipated four novels in a seasonal cycle, is ostensibly about the friendship between a young woman and a very old man. But it’s really about everything: poverty and bureaucracy and sex and mortality and music. Perhaps the most moving thing about it is that it plays out against a certain sense that the world is heading into darker times. Post-Brexit, and with an election looming in the United States, people watch the evening news with their hearts tucked up under their ears. I found this book to be almost unbearably moving in its awareness of what the author praises as the “array of colors of even the pulverized world.” (Read the review.)

How else to put it? This was a corkscrew of a year. Its exceptionalness — the sheer blinding drama of it all — seems to have determined my reading preferences, repeatedly guiding me toward topical subjects. Not on this list, but worth mentioning: Joe Biden’s “Promise Me, Dad” and Hillary Clinton’s “What Happened,” two strong political memoirs, a true rarity (the genre’s generally a dud, an excuse to peddle bromides dipped in chloroform). Not everything on this list is political, of course, and neither are some of my honorable mentions. I particularly enjoyed the thriller “Fierce Kingdom,” by Gin Phillips, and the lively true-crime procedural “American Fire,” by Monica Hesse.

Because this is my final month on the job, I ask one minor indulgence: While my fellow staff critics have done the customary list of 10, I’ve added one more for the road. It’s “Cork Dork.” We can always use a good glass of wine, perhaps especially this year.

‘CORK DORK: A WINE-FUELED ADVENTURE AMONG THE OBSESSIVE SOMMELIERS, BIG BOTTLE HUNTERS, AND ROGUE SCIENTISTS WHO TAUGHT ME TO LIVE FOR TASTE’ By Bianca Bosker (Penguin). Ordinarily, I loathe thousand-yard subtitles, but I’ll concede that here, where I have so little room to write, this one at least does some of the work for me. Bosker, once an editor at The Huffington Post, quit her day job to become a certified sommelier, and her adventures in this sodden universe of fanatics are a combination of rigorous — 20,000 different wines to memorize? — and raucous. (Read the review.)

‘RICHARD NIXON: THE LIFE’ By John A. Farrell (Doubleday). The tests for a good Nixon biography, given how many exist, are fairly simple. One: Is it elegantly written? Two: Can it tolerate paradoxes and complexity, the spikier stuff that distinguishes real-life sinners from comic-book villains? The answer, in the case of this book, is yes on both counts. Farrell’s work also happens to feel eerily relevant. The parallels between Nixon and our current president leap off the page like crickets. (Read the review.)

‘LOCKING UP OUR OWN: CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN BLACK AMERICA’ By James Forman Jr. (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux). This superb, shattering book probably made a deeper impression on me than any other this year. It tells the story, beginning in the 1970s, of how prominent African-Americans played a role in lobbying for more punitive measures to fight gun violence and drug dealing, in the quest to keep their neighborhoods safe. Never once did they imagine that their efforts would result in the inhuman outcome of mass incarceration. A tragedy to the bone. (Read the review.)

‘JANESVILLE: AN AMERICAN STORY’ By Amy Goldstein (Simon & Schuster). A magnificently well-researched ethnography of an ailing Wisconsin town after a General Motors plant shuts down. That it happens to be the home of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan adds to the political drama, but the real tensions are on the ground, where families contend with declining incomes and itinerant dads. The author deserves a medal for her data-driven work on the limits of job retraining. (Read the review.)

‘THE WATER WILL COME: RISING SEAS, SINKING CITIES, AND THE REMAKING OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD’ By Jeff Goodell (Little, Brown). An immersive, mildly gonzo and depressingly well-timed book about the drenching effects of global warming, and a powerful reminder that we can bury our heads in the sand about climate change for only so long before the sand itself disappears. (Read the review.)

‘TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN’ By John Green (Dutton). He may have a gift for screwball comedy, but Green has always had a serious streak too, and this book, his first since “The Fault in Our Stars,” is his most personal and serious yet — more Paul Thomas Anderson than Wes Anderson. The protagonist, Aza, suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (as does Green), and her rogue thoughts threaten to overwhelm her life. One needn’t be a fellow sufferer to be moved to tears. (Read the review.)

‘BLACK EDGE: INSIDE INFORMATION, DIRTY MONEY, AND THE QUEST TO BRING DOWN THE MOST WANTED MAN ON WALL STREET’ By Sheelah Kolhatkar (Random House). A modern version of “Moby-Dick,” with wiretaps rather than harpoons. Kolhatkar, a staff writer for The New Yorker and a former hedge fund analyst, gives a captivating account of skulduggery at SAC Capital Advisors, and of the failure of the Feds to indict its founder, Steven A. Cohen. It would be an uncomplicated pleasure to read if the story weren’t true. (Read the review.)

‘THE FAR AWAY BROTHERS: TWO YOUNG MIGRANTS AND THE MAKING OF AN AMERICAN LIFE’ By Lauren Markham (Crown). An intimately reported and beautifully rendered work of nonfiction about a pair of 17-year-old boys — “unaccompanied alien children,” in the chilly parlance of the law — who come to the United States to escape the gang brutality of El Salvador. An education in the realities of immigration, which, not surprisingly, are more complicated than sound bites from the left or the right would allow. (Read the review.)

‘THE ESSEX SERPENT’ By Sarah Perry (Custom House/William Morrow). This Victorian-era novel is one of almost insolent ambition — lush and fantastical, brimming with ideas. The premise is that a giant sea monster is haunting a small English town, but Perry uses it only as an excuse to riff on faith and science, friendship and solitude. Have I mentioned there are enough love triangles here to confound Euclid? It’s the kind of book that’s so involving you read it as you’re walking down the street. (Read the review.)

‘ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE’ By Elizabeth Strout (Random House). You pick up a book by Strout for the same reason you listen to a requiem: to experience the beauty in sadness. That was the joy of reading her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Olive Kitteridge,” and it’s the joy of reading this novel too, which once again focuses on an interconnected cast of broken souls in a small town. (Read the review.)

‘DYING: A MEMOIR’ By Cory Taylor (Tin House). An electrifying book about dying that’s part dreamy reminiscence, part philosophical monograph. The author, reckoning with Stage 4 melanoma, demystifies the final experience of our lives, exploring questions of control, fear and regret. My copy is underlined like a composition notebook. “For what are we,” Taylor asks, “if not a body taking a mind for a walk, just to see what’s there?” (Read the review.)

As it turns out, nearly every book on my list is a history of violence. More than half are stalked by monsters — real or imaginary. Several are tinged with elements of horror, science fiction and the gothic.

None of this was by design but it feels appropriate. It’s been that kind of year. But these books haven’t stuck with me just because they mirror the mood of a moment. Every book puts a new spin on a classic form: the biography, the short story, the campus novel. Old stories, new strategies. There’s a lesson in there somewhere. (A note on my selections: Since I only began as a staff book critic in July, a few of my picks are books I reviewed or assigned earlier in the year as an editor at The New York Times Book Review.)

‘THE IDIOT’ By Elif Batuman (Penguin Press). Batuman describes the heroine of her first novel, Selin, as “the world’s least interesting and dignified kind of person”: an American teenager. She’s also irresistible — a clever, almost appallingly innocent 6-foot-tall daughter of Turkish immigrants who arrives at Harvard in the mid-’90s and begins wooing a reluctant love interest over email. Every page is thicketed with jokes, riffs, theories of language. It’s a portrait of an intellectual and sentimental education that offers almost unseemly pleasure. (Read the review.)

‘THE COMPLETE STORIES’ By Leonora Carrington (Dorothy). This year is the centennial of the birth of the British Surrealist, who died in 2011. Her short stories are marked by a strange, spectral charm — women undress down to their skeletons; a sociable hyena ventures out to a debutante ball, wearing the face of a murdered maid — but they’re also a form of oblique autobiography. Carrington finds ways to tell her own story — of exile, harrowing institutionalization, reinvention — in code, and with dark mirth. (Read the review.)

‘MY FAVORITE THING IS MONSTERS’ By Emil Ferris (Fantagraphics). Drawn with Bic pen on lined notebook paper, this moody and ravishing graphic novel takes the form of a sketchbook diary. Growing up in Chicago in the 1960s, 10-year-old Karen Reyes investigates the suspicious death of her glamorous neighbor and finds troubling clues lurking close to her own home. The densely crosshatched pages pay homage to Otto Dix’s psychologically shaded portraits and the classic monster magazines of the 1950s. An eerie masterpiece of the monsters around and within us. (Read the review.)

‘THESE POSSIBLE LIVES’ By Fleur Jaeggy, translated by Minna Zallman Proctor (New Directions). The Swiss Italian writer’s unconventional biographies of three writers — Thomas De Quincey, John Keats and Marcel Schwob — contain some of my favorite sentences of the year. “His sister Jane lived three years,” she writes of De Quincey. “When she died, Thomas thought that she would come back, like a crocus. Children who grow up in the country know about death; they can, in a manner of speaking, see their own bones out the window.” Jaeggy finds a new way to tell the story of a life — to pluck out “human characteristics amidst the chaos,” as Schwob described the biographer’s art, and to distill her subjects’ essences onto the page. (Read the review.)

‘HER BODY AND OTHER PARTIES: STORIES’ By Carmen Maria Machado (Graywolf). Machado’s debut collection is a wild thing, blazing with the influence of fabulists from Angela Carter to Kelly Link, borrowing from science fiction, queer theory and horror. These eight tales depict women on the verge — survivors of assault, brutal marriages and mysterious afflictions. Machado finds fresh language for ancient horrors. (Read the review.)

‘DIFFICULT WOMEN: A MEMOIR OF THREE’ By David Plante (New York Review Books). Plante’s recently reissued memoir of his friendships with three literary icons — Jean Rhys, Germaine Greer and Sonia Orwell — is a tart and complicated pleasure. First published in 1983, the book horrified some with its frank portrayals of the women at their most unguarded, vulnerable or drunk, but there’s no denying its power. Each scene burns with dark excitement, and Plante’s honesty is exhilarating. It’s an indelible book about friendship, isolation, ambition — and what it means to make a religion out of literature. (Read the review.)

‘THE EVOLUTION OF BEAUTY: HOW DARWIN’S FORGOTTEN THEORY OF MATE CHOICE SHAPES THE ANIMAL WORLD — AND US’ By Richard O. Prum (Doubleday). Prum, an ornithologist and museum curator, resurrects Darwin’s provocative theory of sexual selection, which argues that animals select mates on the basis of beauty, not just genetic fitness. His elaborations are elegant, persuasive and come to a surprisingly feminist conclusion — that female desire shaped evolution. (Read the review.)

‘BEHAVE: THE BIOLOGY OF HUMANS AT OUR BEST AND WORST’ By Robert M. Sapolsky (Penguin Press). Sapolsky, a neurologist and the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant, offers a masterly cross-disciplinary scientific study of human behavior: What in our glands, our genes, our childhoods explains our species’ capacity for both altruism and brutality? This comprehensive and friendly survey of a “big sprawling mess of a subject” is leavened by an impressive data-to-silly joke ratio. It has my vote for science book of the year. (Read the review.)

‘GHACHAR GHOCHAR’ By Vivek Shanbhag, translated by Srinath Perur (Penguin). There’s a whole universe folded into this slender, spiny novel. It’s a parable of rising India and of violence against women, and a sly commentary on translation (it’s one of the first books written in the Indian language of Kannada to be published in the United States). Shanbhag is an heir to Babel, and this story of a family’s moral unraveling and descent into cruelty after it comes into sudden wealth — capped by a hair-raising ending — already feels like a modern-day classic. (Read the review.)

‘SING, UNBURIED, SING’ By Jesmyn Ward (Scribner). Ward’s National Book Award-winning third novel sings America. A death-haunted, drug-addicted woman and her children take a road trip to collect her white husband from prison, picking up a mysterious hitchhiker on the way: the ghost of a 12-year-old boy who’s on a quest of his own. Delving into the long aftershocks of a hurricane, the ties between slavery and the mass incarceration of black men, and the opioid epidemic devouring rural America, this is a searing, timely novel inspired by classics of American literature, notably Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” and it takes its place among them.

Mine is the strangest of these lists. I left The Times’s staff two and a half years ago, but apparently I won’t go away. I write intermittently about books with the potential to be popular.

The good ones are hard to find. So rather than stick to books I actually reviewed this year, I drew on favorite things I read in 2017, even though one dates back to 1993 and another was reviewed by Dwight Garner. One criterion for this list is: “Is this something you’d give to a friend?” Everything on my list meets that standard.

I’ve left out major titles, like Ron Chernow’s “Grant,” that I reviewed but hardly need attention here. I’d like to mention two first-rate books by actors: Tom Hanks’s “Uncommon Type,” a short-story collection that offers him a second career path if this movie thing doesn’t work out, and Alec Baldwin’s frank memoir “Nevertheless.” Finally, thanks to Bill O’Reilly for “Old School” (written with Bruce Feirstein). He’s right about many things, particularly when it comes to the rigidity of thought on college campuses. But the very idea of a morality lecture from O’Reilly made this the best unintended humor book of 2017.

‘STICKY FINGERS: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JANN WENNER AND ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE’ By Joe Hagan (Knopf). You need not have the slightest interest in Wenner, his magazine or even the music it celebrated to find this a terrifically astute work of pop-cultural history. Hagan chronicles the 50-year arc of longhairs turned climbers turned power brokers, and he does it with insight and flair. A great read, mixing wall-to-wall dish with long-view acuity. This is the book I gave to friends most often this year. (Read the review.)

‘THE DRY’ By Jane Harper (Flatiron). Harper’s swift, dazzling debut thriller is set in a desperately parched part of rural Australia, where nothing is what it seems. The book delivers a twist or shocker or sneaky trick on virtually every page. Harper may be the all-time best advertisement for online courses in fiction writing. Her follow-up, coming in February, will be set where there’s mud. (Read the review.)

‘THE FORCE’ By Don Winslow (William Morrow). Steel yourself for this brutal, gut-punching story of an elite Manhattan police task force trying to maintain some semblance of decency. Winslow’s New York cop story brings to mind Sidney Lumet, Richard Price and other stars of the genre, but he is strictly his own man. Procedural at its start, this story of trapped, corrupted, once-clean Detective Denny Malone is a killer by the time it’s over. (Read the review.)

‘WE ARE NEVER MEETING IN REAL LIFE: ESSAYS’ By Samantha Irby (Vintage). Here’s a madly hilarious blogger who really came into her own this year. Food is her ostensible subject, but she can get anywhere from there. The book is dedicated to Klonopin, and its essays include “I’m in Love and It’s Boring,” “Thirteen Questions to Ask Before Getting Married” and “A Case for Remaining Indoors.” (Read the review.)

‘DEVIL’S BARGAIN: STEVE BANNON, DONALD TRUMP, AND THE STORMING OF THE PRESIDENCY’ By Joshua Green (Penguin Press). A fair and fascinating portrait of Steve Bannon that explains two crucial things: who he is and how he got that way. Green traces the formation of Bannon’s basic beliefs, and finds the roots of the bellicose worldview that helped get President Trump elected. Filled with candid Bannon commentary about Bannon, it’s required reading for anyone interested in the future. (Read the review.)

‘SAINTS FOR ALL OCCASIONS’ By J. Courtney Sullivan (Knopf). Reminiscent of both Colm Toibin’s “Brooklyn” and Matthew Thomas’s “We Are Not Ourselves,” this enveloping novel follows a fraught Irish family through unimaginable trials. It introduces its two main characters as young sisters ready to emigrate from Ireland to America, and follows them through the rest of their lives. All of Sullivan’s characters leap off the page. You don’t read this book; you breathe it. (Read the review.)

‘THE MIDNIGHT LINE: A JACK REACHER NOVEL’ By Lee Child (Delacorte). It was a great year for the usual suspects, the big-name crime writers who always publish in mid-fall. After a brief period of the doldrums, a reinvigorated Child bounced back with an unusually impassioned story. The book’s first half feels like business as usual. Then it takes a sudden turn toward something important and genuinely wrenching. Child’s finales can be crazily far-fetched, but the last part of this one really matters. (Read the review.)

‘TWO KINDS OF TRUTH’ By Michael Connelly (Little, Brown). Connelly had a banner year. This summer, in “The Late Show,” he introduced a youngish new series heroine, Renée Ballard, who’ll come in handy as Harry Bosch moves through his late 60s. But Bosch is a ball of fire in this exceptionally good police procedural that tackles the opioid crisis — a ubiquitous plot point this year — head-on. And Harry gets to go undercover as a “pill shill.” Dive into this tightly plotted detective story for details. (Read the review.)

‘CAMINO ISLAND’ By John Grisham (Doubleday). Every now and then Grisham tries something new. This year he hit a bull’s-eye with a beach book featuring a bunch of writers, not a bunch of lawyers. There’s a huge sense of fun to this little experiment, which is good enough to be worth continuing. And for fans rattled by novelty, Grisham also delivered “The Rooster Bar” this year, a sharp-clawed attack on student debt and the for-profit law school racket. Good idea; good, vengeful execution. (Read the interview with Grisham.)

‘LOST TYCOON: THE MANY LIVES OF DONALD J. TRUMP’ By Harry Hurt III (Echo Point Books). When president-elect Trump booted the author of this 1993 unauthorized biography off one of his golf courses, I sensed that Hurt’s book might be of interest. Yes, indeed. It’s a prescient account of Trump’s business ethics, calculated manipulation of his inner circle, flair for fact-free hyperbole and nascent political ambitions at a time when anyone who knew him thought he was joking.

Dr. Post calls it stealth science. “It’s a great way to get people in the door,” he said. “If you put up a sign that says geology, nobody comes. But if you say, ‘This way to the Hope Diamond,’ then everybody wants to know more.”

Dr. Harlow suggested that precious gems gained their reputation in part by their association with gold. As insoluble stones, the gems ended up concentrated at the bottom of stream beds, often in the vicinity of similarly insoluble gold. Long prized for its ductility, beauty and resistance to oxidation, gold was considered the property of rulers and kings, so why not the glittering stones found beside it?

The word diamond stems from the Greek terms for “indestructible” and “that which cannot be tamed,” Dr. Harlow said, “and those attributed metaphysical properties made the ruler seem even more important.”

Diamonds are not indestructible, but they are the hardest substances known, given the top score of 10 on the Mohs scale of hardness — that is, resistance to scratching. Behind a diamond’s untameability is its three-dimensional structure, a repeating crystalline lattice of carbon atoms, each one strongly bonded to four neighbors atop, below and to either side.

(In graphite, by contrast, carbon atoms are bonded together only in two-dimensional sheets, which will flake apart with the simple act of putting pencil to paper.)

Persuading large numbers of carbon atoms to lock limbs in all directions requires Stygian whips of high heat and pressure, as until recently could only be found underground. In theory, the earth’s mantle, which is thought to hold about 90 percent of the planet’s carbon supply, is practically glittering with diamonds at various stages of formation.

Getting those jewels to the surface in bling-worthy condition is another matter. Diamonds must be shot up from below quickly — say, through a volcanic eruption — or they’ll end up as so much coal in your stocking. Researchers have discovered diamonds that had blundered crustward slowly enough for their carbon bonds to expand, leaving a stone with the shape of a diamond but the consistency of graphite.

Gareth Davies, a professor of geology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and his colleagues have recapitulated the reversion process in the laboratory. “Yes, we get diamonds and turn them to graphite for research,” he said. “And my wife wonders why I’m such an idiot.”

Researchers can also fabricate diamonds in the laboratory, although the results are more often destined for industry than Tiffany. Nor can scientists create anything remotely as celestial as the Hope Diamond, the world’s largest deep-blue diamond, with a back story to match.

The diamond was discovered in India, sold to King Louis XIV of France in 1668, stolen during the French Revolution, reappeared 50 years later in the collection of the Dutch banker Henry Philip Hope — hence its name — sold by Hope’s bankrupted heir and then passed from hand to sometimes unfortunate hand, picking up an aura en route of being “cursed.”

After the jeweler Harry Winston donated the diamond to the Smithsonian Institution in 1958, blithely sending the massive jewel from New York to Washington through the mail, the diamond’s fame exploded. When Jackie Kennedy, then the First Lady, arranged a one-month loan of the diamond to the Louvre in Paris, Washington’s National Gallery of Art got Leonardo’s “Mona Lisa” in return.

Researchers have since plied the 45-carat diamond with every noninvasive tool in their arsenal, seeking to understand the precise distribution of boron atoms that lend the Hope its steely blue tint and why the diamond will glow, or phosphoresce, a spectral shade of blood orange when exposed to ultraviolet light. Dr. Post suspects the phosphorescence is the result of interactions between boron and nitrogen impurities in the diamond’s near-flawless carbon frame.

Coloration mechanics figure more prominently still in the genesis of colored gemstones. After all, sapphires and rubies are built of the same basic mineral, corundum, a crystallized collaboration of aluminum and oxygen that would be transparent and colorless if not for some artful chemical doping.

With a Mohs hardness score just a point shy of diamond’s, corundum becomes a red ruby through the timely addition of chromium atoms. Recent research suggests chromium is shoved up to the crust from Earth’s mantle when continental landmasses bang together.

A sapphire is a corundum crystal of any color but red, although many people consider a true sapphire to be blue. In that case, the blue results from electrons bouncing back and forth between near-homeopathic doses of iron and titanium atoms sprinkled throughout the crystal.",Precious Gems Bear Messages From Earth’s Molten Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/science/gemstones-diamonds-sapphires-rubies.html

On the surface, Akayed Ullah seemed to be an ordinary member of a Bangladeshi enclave in Brooklyn. He often prayed at a mosque in an unassuming brownstone in the Kensington section of the borough, where a few thousand of his countrymen reside. Like many immigrants in New York, he made his living — at least for a while — driving for a car service.

But on Monday morning, Mr. Ullah, 27, strapped a pipe bomb to his body and set out to detonate it in a Times Square subway station, the police said, not only causing chaos among crowds of commuters, but also leaving behind a trail of mystery that baffled those who knew him.

“He was a good guy,” said Mohammad Yousuf, a cabdriver who prayed with Mr. Ullah at the mosque. “I can’t believe he would do anything like this.”

According to several law enforcement officials, Mr. Ullah said he set off the bomb in retaliation for American airstrikes in Syria and elsewhere, targeting members of the Islamic State, or ISIS. He told investigators that he had been radicalized online and had made a number of trips overseas in the past five years, visiting Bangladesh in recent months, one of the officials said.

Mr. Ullah admitted that he had looked up online how to build the bomb and had assembled it in his residence in Brooklyn, purchasing all of the materials except the pipe, which he said he found at a job site where he was working as an electrician at 39th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, two of the officials said.",Suspect in Times Square Bombing Leaves Trail of Mystery,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/akayed-ullah-port-authority-bombing-suspect.html

Chuck Sprankles, 62, a resident of the North County Fire Protection District, a semirural area north of San Diego, said the authorities came regularly to inspect the landscaping.

“The system is working,” Mr. Sprankles said. “If you notice, the homes that were burned up had a lot of brush and trees around them.”

Mr. Sprankles’s house, which sits on a one-acre lot, was spared, a fact that he attributes to his wife spending around five hours every week cutting overgrowth and collecting fallen leaves.

“Last week we had three barrels full,” he said.

In San Diego, Joanne Salzman applauded the program, noting that her home was also safe.

“We could have lost all of this,” she said.” Because when it takes one house, it takes another. I think it definitely helped.”

John Buchanan, an engineer paramedic with the district, said he saw examples last week of homes that firefighters were able to save because residents had cleared brush. “The fire came right up to around 40 homes and we were able to protect all of them,” he said.

Over all, 151 homes in his district were destroyed by the Lilac Fire in San Diego County, compared with around 250 during the last major wildfire in 2007, Mr. Buchanan said. The Lilac Fire was 80 percent contained on Monday.

Mr. Buchanan described seeing the fire leap over a four-lane highway driven by intense winds. “It looked like a million fireflies flying over to ignite the tinder dry brush,” Mr. Buchanan said.

However, Richard Halsey, the director of the California Chaparral Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection of shrub land, said the fires of the past two months had proved what he argued has become the increasing futility of brush-removal programs that might have been effective.

“It’s not working,” he said. “These fires in October and this month clearly demonstrate we’re doing something wrong. We are not understanding that in this changing climate, with these fierce winds, nothing is going to work unless we address the flammability of these structures.”

Mr. Halsey said it would make far more sense to invest in home fire prevention systems — sprinkling systems that coat the outside of a house with a mist of water, and fire-resistant roofs — and to stop encouraging developments on land that are prone to wildfires.

But Chief Terrazas said it would be a mistake to abandon the brush-cutting policies. He said that while they might not have been as much help over these past two weeks, fires in California take very different forms.

“We don’t know what kind of fire we are going to have,” he said. “We have to use every tool we have.”","In California, Mixed Results for Regulations Meant to Help Stop Fires",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/california-widlfires-prevention-regulations.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Let’s not let last week pass without mention of one bit of important California history. It was 50 years ago when Willie Brown, the San Francisco Democrat, was first elected to the Assembly. It’s almost a cliché to say they don’t make them like that anymore — well it is a cliché, but so what. They don’t.

Mr. Brown held office before California voters adopted term limits, which meant he was able to serve 15 years leading the Assembly. All those years meant that Mr. Brown had the kind of knowledge, connection and experience that helped make him one of the most powerful leaders in California history.

And his career kept going after he left Sacramento. He became mayor of San Francisco and today, at 83, he is writing political columns for the San Francisco Chronicle, where, characteristically, he has shown no reluctance in letting you know how he thinks. “Democrats needed the high road, so they ran over Al Franken,” read the headline over Mr. Brown’s weekend offering.

Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and especially during the administration of Michael R. Bloomberg, he shifted the basis of contract talks from solely how much the city could afford to how employees could help the city save money.

As a result, Mr. Hanley negotiated major gains in productivity to help pay for wage hikes and other benefits.

He held the view that more could be accomplished at the bargaining table than through arbitration. In 2008, he struck a deal with the city’s main police union despite lingering animosity between management and labor exacerbated by their 14 years of failure to reach an agreement through negotiations.

“He was an incredibly dedicated and respected public servant who knew every aspect of the city’s bargaining history,” said Robert W. Linn, the current director of labor relations.

Mayor Edward I. Koch promoted Mr. Hanley to first deputy labor commissioner in 1988. He was chosen as commissioner by Mayor David N. Dinkins, reverted to deputy briefly under Mr. Giuliani and was promoted again in 1995. He retired in 2014.

James Francis Hanley was born on Aug. 25, 1948, in the Hell’s Kitchen section of Manhattan, to Irish immigrants. His father, Jeremiah, was a truck driver for the city. His mother was the former Eileen Linehan. His parents died when he was a teenager.

After graduating from St. Peter’s Boys High School on Staten Island, he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from St. Peter’s College (now St. Peter’s University) in Jersey City.

During and after college he worked as an apprentice electrician on the World Trade Center and as a social studies teacher at a parochial school in Harlem while studying for a master’s degree in labor economics at the New School. He joined the Office of Labor Relations in 1973 as a junior researcher.

In addition to his son Liam, he is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Giacona; two other sons, Matthew and Terence; four grandchildren; a sister, Maureen Gallagher; and a brother, Jeremiah. Another brother, the Rev. Fintan Hanley, died in 1989. Mr. Hanley lived in the Richmondtown section of Staten Island.

In 2002, wrestling with restrictive work rules inherited from the previously independent Board of Education, Mr. Hanley quietly intervened to facilitate a settlement after seven weeks between striking drivers and private school bus companies.

Over the years he won concessions from unions for lower salaries and benefits for newly hired workers, pledges to help find additional workplace savings, and a discounted subway and bus fare to encourage city employees to commute by mass transit.

Mr. Hanley, who stood an imposing 6-foot-5, was jocular and amiable but, when necessary, could be tough.

During contract negotiations with the teachers’ union, he once recalled, Ms. Weingarten would call him before 7:30 every morning.

“She can see my office window from her apartment, and every day, the moment I walked in and turned on the light, a few minutes later the phone would ring,” Mr. Hanley told The New York Times in 2007. “It was as if she was waiting there for me.”

When protesting firefighters shouted, “Hanley must go; we want our money,” at his Staten Island home, he went outside to suggest a mantra with better cadence.

The vehicle is supposed to go 300 miles before needing to recharge its battery, giving it a greater range than any electric cars now on the market.","Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification, said Thursday that the company had altered its plans for the Michigan plant — in Flat Rock, 25 miles southwest of Detroit — because it now expected the market for self-driving cars for taxis and delivery fleets to grow rapidly after it rolls out its first model in 2021.

“We want to make sure we have the capacity at Flat Rock when we launch,” he said in an interview. “We are very optimistic that we will grow the volume in the autonomous business.”

Ford now plans to invest $900 million in the Flat Rock location, up from $700 million. The company said the retooling for autonomous vehicles would create 850 jobs there, 150 more than it previously expected.

Producing electric cars in Mexico will enable Ford to take advantage of lower labor costs and improve the “fitness” of that business, Mr. Marakby said.

Ford’s change in plans was reported by The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by the automaker.

Electric vehicles tend to be expensive to build and generate thin profit margins or even lose money because batteries remain costly and sales volume low. Auto wages in Mexico rarely exceed $10 an hour, compared with about $29 an hour in the United States.

“If you’re worried about your margins on your E.V., moving production to Mexico is not a bad idea,” said Mike Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner.

Ford plans to begin assembling a small, battery-powered sport-utility vehicle in a plant in Cuautitlán, north of Mexico City, in 2020. The vehicle is supposed to go 300 miles before needing to recharge its battery, giving it a greater range than any electric cars now on the market.

Ford plans to follow that model with at least 12 electric vehicles as part of a broader, global strategy. Ford and other automakers expect sales of electric cars to take off in the years ahead as China, European Union countries and others push automakers to cut tailpipe emissions.

Ford’s shift drew no immediate public comment from President Trump. While campaigning last year, he criticized the company repeatedly for its plan to build a small-car plant in Mexico. He also criticized G.M. for importing Chevrolet hatchbacks from a Mexican plant.

In January, in the days leading up to Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Ford announced that it was canceling the new plant and investing in Flat Rock instead. That drew compliments from the president-elect.

In May, however, Ford ousted its chief executive, Mark Fields, and replaced him with Jim Hackett. Under Mr. Hackett, Ford seems to have taken a different tack. In one of his first moves, he set a plan to import Focus compacts into the United States from a plant in China.","Ford Will Build Electric Cars in Mexico, Shifting Its Plan",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/business/ford-plant-electric.html

Cloistered, for now, mostly behind the Kremlin walls, the intrigues are expected to burst into public view with increasing frequency in coming years.

Several internal battles have already erupted publicly, including the dismantling of a respected research university and a startling corruption trial in which a former minister accused of soliciting bribes said he was set up by a former spy who has been a close Putin ally. It is the kind of fight the president would have managed privately in previous years.

“You cannot hide the enormous tension, the enormous degree of uncertainty within the Russian elite,” said Konstantin Gaaze, who contributes political analysis to the website of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a policy research organization. “They will do stupid things; they will blackmail each other; they will write reports about each other and bring them to Putin.”

For the coming three months, the election will be the main distraction. Then Mr. Putin, who will turn 72 in 2024, is expected to start building something of a retirement plan.

In the view of some analysts, the president believes that trying to retain the job for life would be a mistake. One day, if he stays too long, he could be hastily deposed — like the recent experience of President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe after 37 years in office.

“Putin thinks of himself as an historical figure, and he knows that if he wants to put himself into the history books, he should not repeat Mugabe’s mistake — he should find the right time to leave,” said Konstantin Kalachyov, the head of the Political Expert Group and an occasional consultant for the Kremlin.

At the same time, Mr. Putin is likely to want to preserve some political role after 2024 and not simply retire to his dacha, or worse, end up in jail.

“He cannot just go,” Mr. Gaaze said. “He knows perfectly well that if his successor fails, they will both be prosecuted.”

Some expect Mr. Putin to reshape the Constitution to create some kind of higher military or security council, appointing himself to lead it and securing his influence. “I cannot imagine a situation where he gives all power to the successor; he does not trust anybody,” Mr. Gaaze said.

Mr. Putin has done something similar before. When his second consecutive term as president ended in 2008, he served as prime minister during the one-term presidency of Dmitri A. Medvedev, although it was understood he remained the country’s ultimate leader. Starting with the election of 2012, the president’s term in office was extended from four years to six.

Mr. Pavlovsky, who worked in the Kremlin under President Boris N. Yeltsin, recalled that the process to replace Mr. Yeltsin, who was ailing, began right after he won the 1996 election and would clearly not run again.

It meant rebuilding the state, not just replacing the man.

“We knew that Yeltsin would be gone in 2000, and we did not want the state to go with him,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “It was Yeltsin’s Russia. Yeltsin was going, so Yeltsin’s Russia was going too, and we had to found a new Russia.”

Mr. Yeltsin appointed Mr. Putin his successor in 2000, and he has been the most powerful man in Russia ever since. Because Mr. Putin has centralized so much power, the question of who will succeed him is especially urgent.

“Today we have Putin’s Russia,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “If Putin is gone, Putin’s Russia also has to go. That is also a dangerous situation. His entourage understands this and wants to preserve Putin’s Russia after he is gone.”

So the various factions within the Putin Court will seek to convince the president to name an heir apparent who best preserves their collective interests.

For those angling to succeed the president, it is a high-wire act. Candidates need to be careful not to be seen as an immediate threat to the president, notoriously protective of his position. Push too hard, too fast, and a person could be purged.

And as 2024 nears, Mr. Putin’s ability to protect likely successors could lessen, putting them at risk of being brought down by rivals. As a result, no one is expected to seek the heir apparent title openly.

“People considered possible successors are ready to pay not to be called that,” Mr. Kalachyov said.

The Kremlin dismissed talk of internal intrigues, with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, calling such speculation the favorite pastime of political analysts. “That is what they do,” he said.

There have already been signs of Mr. Putin’s influence starting to ebb, however, and a few brutish spats among the elite have spilled into the open.

Russia’s former economy minister, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, delivered a long, emotional soliloquy at the closing of his corruption trial on Thursday about what he views as political treachery.

He faces up to 10 years in a penal colony on charges of soliciting a $2 million bribe to approve a major oil deal sought by the state oil giant Rosneft, run by Igor I. Sechin, a Putin ally and former military intelligence agent.

Mr. Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty, accusing Mr. Sechin of setting up a cloak-and-dagger sting operation by proffering a gift of fine wine and homemade sausages to disguise a brown leather satchel brimming with dollars.

In his speech, the former minister warned the Kremlin elite that anyone could be next in the docket. “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee,” he said, quoting the classic lines of John Donne. “It can toll for any one of you. It’s become very easy: a bag, a basket, a grainy video, three clicks, and it’s ready.”

In a show of force, Mr. Sechin refused a court summons to appear as a witness at the trial four times, saying he was too busy.

Aside from Mr. Ulyukayev, Mr. Sechin appears intent on crushing Sistema, a wealthy investment firm, by filing repeated lawsuits — despite public admonitions from Mr. Putin that he would like such disputes settled amicably.

Mr. Sechin also publicly, and unexpectedly, pledged to work with Ramzan Kadyrov, the autocratic leader of Chechnya. Both men have shown an increasing tendency to act independently of Mr. Putin, distancing themselves even though it was the president’s protection that allowed both to become outsize figures with vast fortunes and personal fiefs.

If Mr. Sechin and Mr. Kadyrov share a common cause, it is trying to help choose the next president, the best insurance for those in the inner circle. “Because the others, except those who decide the successor to Putin, will all be in great danger,” Mr. Pavlovsky said.

The more Mr. Putin becomes a lame duck, analysts said, the less influence he may have in choosing a successor and the more Kremlin insiders will assert themselves. Many point to the case of the European University at St. Petersburg as an example that Mr. Putin’s protection is no longer as robust.

By numerous accounts, Mr. Putin tried to preserve the university, a respected private, liberal, postgraduate institution. Conservative nationalists hated it, and real estate developers coveted the historic Small Marble Palace where it was housed.

First the university lost its building, and last week it was denied an operating license for the third time. The demise came despite what one senior university official and various Russian news reports described as three attempts by Mr. Putin to get the Education Ministry to protect the place.

“What matters now is your own potential independent of Putin,” Mr. Pavlovsky said, “because the moment is rapidly approaching when Putin will not be able to help you.”",Putin’s Re-election Is Assured.

In a DIY precursor to downhill skiing, the latest on-slope trend is to go uphill.

Called skinning, the activity of walking up a downhill slope on skis to schuss back down exemplifies a no-pain, no-gain ethos among skiers determined to earn their turns for the sheer challenge (or to burn calories). Skinning falls under the family of activities known as uphilling, which includes snowboarders using special split boards, snowshoers and hikers.

“Skinning is one part aerobic hill workout, one part downhill skiing,” said Ted Mahon, an avid uphill skier and a 20-year veteran ski instructor with the Aspen Skiing Company who teaches uphill touring. “It’s more than just exercise. You’re climbing a mountain.”

He added that it can be “meditative” with “an almost Zen-like winter stillness where all you hear is your breath and the sound of the skis sliding on the snow.”

What was once strictly a backcountry practice, used to explore ungroomed, off-piste terrain, is becoming more common in the front country. Fifty percent of ski resorts in the country now allow uphill skiing on their slopes, according to the National Ski Areas Association, an industry resort group. Several are adding new uphill ski races this year.

In addition to physical fitness, skinning requires special ski boots and bindings that free the heel to march up a mountain. Non-slip “skins,” special coverings that prevent the skis from sliding backwards, go on the bottom of the skis for the vertical trip.

Sales of alpine touring equipment used to go up and down hills rose 13 percent last year, according to Snowsports Industries America, a nonprofit trade association representing ski manufacturers and retailers, and the trend has led to lighter downhill skis.

“You can hike up before the lifts open and get first tracks down,” said Nick Sargent, the president of Snowsports Industries America. “The weekend warrior is getting the most out of the day by hiking up in the morning.”

As uphilling has increased in popularity it has forced ski resorts to reckon with safety issues related to two-way traffic. Resorts that allow vertical ascents often have a designated uphill zone that is sometimes cordoned off from the rest of a run to prevent downhillers from entering uphill territory and vice versa. Some allow it at specific times or only on specific trails.

For skiers, the practice offers a new way to explore the mountain, especially if downhill conditions are marginal, as in the case of warm weather or light snow cover. Beginners may try it, according to Mr. Mahon, as long as they climb a run they can handle going downhill or take the ski lift or gondola back down.

“If you’re just getting started and you’re building your skills and confidence, embarking on a ski run with tired legs after a large physical effort isn’t something most beginner skiers get excited about,” he said.

At resorts, uphill access policies vary. Sometimes a lift ticket is required, other times it is discounted or free. Windham Mountain in the Catskills Mountains of New York offers an uphill ticket for $10 a day or $25 for the season and Killington Resort in Vermont offers an uphill season pass for $20. Arapahoe Basin in Colorado normally offers free uphill access, pending avalanche mitigation work.

Because it requires special gear and different skills, some ski resorts are adding skinning to their ski school menus or holding special events related to it. Other outfitters offer guided trips in the backcountry. The following are some ways to circumvent the chairlift before pointing your skis downslope.

WHERE TO FIND A GUIDE

Aspen Skiing Company, which operates Snowmass, Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands and Buttermilk in Colorado, has embraced uphilling, adding Dynafit uphill skis to its rental inventory this year. Aspen Snowmass offers both private and group full-day lessons (group lessons start at $164 a person and private lessons cost $795 a day for up to five guests).

Near Lake Tahoe, Calif., Kirkwood offers an extensive backcountry education program for experienced skiers that includes workshops on Jan. 20 and Feb. 3 ($200), and regularly available private guides ($465 for a half day).

In the Canadian Rockies, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Yamnuska Mountain Adventures have teamed to offer guided tours for intermediate and advanced skiers just outside of the ski resort boundary ($210 Canadian dollars, or about $165).

For intermediate and advanced skiers, High Sierra Snowcat & Yurt in California’s eastern Sierra Mountains has added guided backcountry trips that involve yurt-to-yurt transit both uphill and down ($295 a person each day, including meals, accommodations and guides).

WHERE TO ‘SKIN’

In Utah, Utah Ski Mountaineering, a nonprofit group, compiles uphill policies at ski areas throughout the state. Brighton Resort operates a stoplight system to indicate whether its designated uphill routes are open.

Monarch Mountain near Salida, Colo., added a dedicated uphill lane last year, joining other Colorado ski areas, including Crested Butte Mountain Resort, Sunlight, Breckenridge and Steamboat, in offering uphill access.

Visitors to Las Vegas can take a winter break at nearby Lee Canyon where uphill traffic tripled last year. Uphill skiing passes are complimentary, but skiers must check in at the base lodge before ascending.

WHERE TO CONGREGATE

Even ski areas that don’t regularly offer uphill access are adding special events that cater to enthusiasts.

Solitude Mountain Resort in Utah does not allow uphill travel regularly “due to the tremendous amount of avalanche mitigation work that is frequently conducted throughout the winter season,” Sherri Harkin, a spokeswoman for the resort, wrote in an email.

Nonetheless, it plans to allow uphilling at the resort on two days this season during its Utah Skimo Race series. Events take place after the regular ski day ends on Jan. 30 and Feb. 13. Skiers must bring their own gear and rentals are available at Wasatch Touring in Salt Lake City.

Near Denver, Winter Park Resort will hold its first Uphill Battle on Feb. 10. Participants race to 10,713 feet before skiing back down to compete for the best time. There is also a snowshoe option.

Other Colorado resorts holding uphill races and parties include Aspen, where America’s Uphill race, a 2.5-mile, 3,000-foot vertical climb up Aspen Mountain, will take place March 30. Breckenridge will offer an Ascent Series of ski mountaineering races on Wednesdays throughout the winter season. Crested Butte will hold four full moon parties at its mountaintop Umbrella Bar for uphillers this year.

In Canada, Mount Tremblant, about a 90-minute drive north of Montreal, began offering uphill touring four years ago and celebrates the practice during its Festival Rando Alpine Tremblant, which will take place from Feb. 2 to 4. There will be a sunrise ascent as well as the Night Traverse, featuring an uphill hike beginning at dusk and a return down a freshly groomed run using headlamps.

“Johnny was a bit thuggish, embraced by people who worked in factories,” said Olivier Seiler, a Parisian production designer and one of the few people I know who harbors an unabashed and unreconstructed love of Mr. Hallyday. The French elite is made up of well-spoken front-row kids like Emmanuel Macron, products of exclusive schools, and often from aristocratic families. Mr. Hallyday was for those who didn’t do so well on the test, and in France, that’s most people. Flunking out in France is not glamorous the way it can be in America, where enough college dropouts become Silicon Alley moguls that it’s a cultural cliché. Johnny’s rebelliousness may no longer be connected to a youthquake, but it still means something.

Even if most hip Parisians dumped Johnny in the 1970s, that still left a lot of incredibly loyal fans. Many will be present on the Champs-Élysées — ground zero for celebrating national soccer wins and commemorating war anniversaries — on Saturday for Mr. Hallyday’s funeral, in the company of President Macron and a long line of bikers. Some are using the occasion of Mr. Hallyday’s death to affirm their uncoolness as a point of pride. A rough translation of what one young woman wrote on Twitter is: “There are those who look at the fans of Johnny like, ‘I’m dying, look at all these losers.’ But, hey, no one asked you, Marie-Jeanne. It’s lunchtime, so go eat your quinoa salmon bowl and let people be sad if they want.”

There is no loyalty quite like French loyalty. As I learned after moving to Paris in 2006, when compared with Americans, the French may be standoffish and circumspect at first, but once they let you in, you are family.

They do not let go of old stars easily either. Even if someone’s music has become objectively terrible, if he was once embraced, he will be forever. To wit, the runaway success of Stars 80. The first time I heard of it, I thought it referred to “Star 80,” Bob Fosse’s retelling of the murder of Dorothy Stratten. Quite the opposite.

Stars 80 — it’s French, the “s” is silent! — is a concert series featuring the absolute worst of 1980s French pop. It toured 10 years ago as a nostalgia revival and sold out stadiums all over the country. So great was its success that it spawned a comedy film franchise starring the same talent whose third installation came out in French theaters last week. (Disclosure: My partner worked on it as an assistant art director last year.) I will not be rushing to the “ciné,” but I do not begrudge anyone else’s doing so.

As low-cost airfare, Instagram and avocado toast homogenize our leisure pursuits, encroaching on France’s exceptionalism, the French treasure anything theirs and only theirs steadfastly. I don’t blame them. Johnny’s fame is most connected to France’s cherished “Trente Glorieuses,” the 30 prosperous years after World War II — which is the same period that brought the country its lavish social security system and a taxpayer-funded culture industry that allows people like my partner to work on movies and television productions without fear of penury.

The night of my long walk back from the wedding turned out to be a history-making night for Johnny’s fans: The concert was free, celebrating his 40th anniversary as a singer, and was attended by an estimated 350,000 people. A good mile away from the tower, we turned around and, like so many other enchanted Americans before us, watched it sparkle. Paris was beautiful spread out below. I wouldn’t have seen it zipping away in a cab.

The snow sparkled on broad Kath Run at Boyne Highlands in northern Michigan as Tony Sendlhofer and I hit the powdery margins with each slope-hogging S-turn, leaving a joyous loopy trail on the freshly groomed corduroy of a sunny Sunday in March.

“They say about Midwest skiers that we love to make turns,” said Mr. Sendlhofer, a native of Austria and the director of the resort’s snow sports. “That’s what we have, to make it last.”

By our turns, we Michiganders say, you shall know us, from Aspen to Zermatt. Our mountains, with their 500-foot drops, some call hills . But the resorts of northern Michigan have a tradition of teaching by European experts that goes back to the earliest days of skiing in the United States and a reputation for raising ski enthusiasts eager to make tracks at the larger mountain destinations of the world.

“Because of shorter runs and sometimes icy conditions, skiers in this section of the state seem to really focus on making a great turn,” said Jim Neff, the editor of MichiganSkier.com. “When I go out West, I can make turns lasting 100 yards instead of 5 or 10 yards.”

As a Detroit native and a lifelong visitor to the region known as “Up North,” I learned to turn on these hills, acquiring ski skills that have served me well from Switzerland to New Zealand. Affordability is a major draw — lift tickets often cost less than half of what the big Western resorts command — as is natural beauty, albeit of the subtle Midwestern sort.

Three of the region’s top ski areas reside in the upper left quadrant of the Michigan mitten, which is rough geography for the map of the state’s Lower Peninsula that locals commonly make with their palms held high. None is more than 90 miles apart, making it easy to hill-hop from the fruit-growing region around Traverse City following the Lake Michigan shoreline north to the highlands bracketing Little Traverse Bay.

It’s a part of the state that has drawn celebrity émigrés (the chef Mario Batali owns a house north of Traverse City), hardy winemakers and a fair number of protectionist locals. As my friend Mike Fisher, who grew up near Petoskey, often says, “This is the best place on earth. Don’t tell anyone.”

In summer, the Great Lakes and the lesser ones attract tourists and second-home owners from near and far, swelling towns like Charlevoix and Harbor Springs. In winter, most of their T-shirt and fudge shops close, reminding me just how lean a four-season existence in northern Michigan really is.

I’ve always thought of winter as the magical season of warm fires, trackless drift-filled forests and sunsets that paint the snow-covered lakes pink. For skiers who like to explore, it’s also the best time to meet the locals in resort towns like Traverse City and Petoskey with the sort of history and authenticity that most newer western ski resorts try to construct.

Over a long weekend last winter, I took a northern Michigan road trip to test my theory that elevation isn’t everything and compensations can come well off-piste.

The snow guns at Crystal Mountain in Thompsonville, 30 miles south of Traverse City, were blasting when I arrived on a bright afternoon, blotting out the blue sky in artificial clouds during a remarkably warm winter season. The thrum of the machines continued all night, frosting the tidy base village and piling more promising accumulations on the hills as the conditions, dipping to 11 degrees, improved.

Eight lifts provide easy access to 102 acres of skiing, which is helpful as, with a 375-foot rise, I found myself riding the chairs a lot. The main high-speed quad delivers skiers to beginner, intermediate and expert runs, as well as what turned out to be my favorites in the Backyard: five mostly blue runs on the far side of the hill that I had to myself for hours without having to slow much to catch the lift.

Crystal was my first reminder that Michigan resorts do not compete on mountain stats. It takes creativity to vie for winter business in an industry dependent on increasingly unpredictable weather and the challenge of bigger mountains within a three-hour plane ride. Recreational diversity abounds and Crystal’s unique attraction, Michigan Legacy Art Park, strews over 40 pieces of sculpture throughout a wooded, 30-acre plot threaded by rolling snowshoe trails where the spiraling wood boards of “Sawpath No. 2” by David Barr seemed a fitting descendant of the hardwoods above it.

Liftopia, which sells discounted lift tickets to ski resorts globally, named Crystal Mountain second nationally in last year’s Best in Snow awards, a measurement that considers skier visits, size, cost and the passion of its 10,000 respondents. Like them, I was impressed by the cheer of the hotel staff at Inn on the Mountain and the availability of amenities ranging from a spa to good restaurants. The menu at the slope-side wood-paneled Thistle Pub & Grill hewed to local flavors like cherry barbecued pork (over 70 percent of the nation’s tart cherry harvest is grown in the area annually) and shaved brussels sprouts salad with Michigan apples. The house red wine came from Black Star Farms in the nearby Leelanau Peninsula.

Ask a simple question of a Michigander — my go-to was “What’s fun around here?” — and you’re bound to get a laundry list of recommendations. I quickly found my Michigan ski trip was less about the resort than the region when I was directed off-property for a drink at Crystal’s new neighbor, Iron Fish Distillery.

The farm-to-flask operation grows 30 percent its own grain and gets the rest locally, then mills, mashes, ferments and distills it on site. The end products, including a tasty gin made with regional botanicals, are named for the steelhead in the neighboring Betsie River.

“Its personality is similar to whiskey,” said Richard Anderson, one of the owners, showing me around the stills installed in a barnlike production room. “Fishermen describe them as coy, territorial, strong and determined. It’s a fish with attitude.”

A Mexican food truck was pulling in for the après-ski hour as I set out for Traverse City. The largest city in the north, Traverse, as it is called, has taken its cue from the orchards and vineyards nearby to nurture a culinary flare evident at a range of restaurants and bars from thoughtful microbreweries to ambitious locavore restaurants such as Alliance.

Even in town, the country was never far away. I checked into the new Hotel Indigo Traverse City opposite Grand Traverse Bay, where a photo mural of river rocks decorated the room. The city’s many breweries, shops and restaurants lay within walking distance. At the Workshop Brewing Company, with the cheeky slogan “Pour to the People,” runners registering for a chilly 5K race the next day stopped for pints of Sickle saison over board-games of Guess Who? and rounds at the foosball table. I continued my pedestrian pub crawl a few blocks away in a former canning company loading dock at Rare Bird Brew Pub named for the owners’ passion for bird-watching and filled with tables salvaged from a local cottonwood tree that was over 120 years old when it died.

Overnight snow — this skier’s prayer fulfilled — slicked the two-lane roads that lead 58 miles north from Traverse City to Boyne Mountain in Boyne Falls. The Tyrolean-accented resort became Michigan’s leading ski area when Everett Kircher, a Studebaker dealer and avid skier from Detroit, found 40 acres with a 1,150-foot rise in the northern woods and paid the skeptical owner $1 to build a winter resort in 1947. Its base village presses against the mountain’s rise, producing an energizing degree of congestion. Snow-flocked Adirondack chairs clustered around open fires near a food truck serving beef shank tacos. Some 10 lifts scaled its broad face, offering plenty of choices.

I joined Wolfgang Russold, another native of Austria and the director of Boyne’s ski school, on the central Mountain Express chair where he explained Boyne’s long tradition of Austrian recruitment, “for flavor and for labor,” he said. “Ski instructor certification is more rigorous in Austria than here,” and Everett Kircher wanted the best.

In 1954, he recruited the Norwegian Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen to run the Boyne ski school and dazzle crowds with his signature aerial flip. Othmar Schneider, an Olympic champion from Austria, took over in 1961 for the next 14 winters.

Skiers came from around the Midwest to learn the then-new reverse-shoulder technique at Boyne. As skiing caught on in the 1960s, Kircher, “a wiry little man who operates at Bravura tempo and dances to his own tune,” according to Skiing magazine, continued to tinker with his formula. He developed the first three-person chairlift, installed the first four-person lift and advanced snow-making technology.

There are luxury condominiums here now and a hotel with a grand lobby, testaments to the resort’s year-round appeal that includes two golf courses. An indoor water park, added in 2005, ensures families have plenty of diversion whatever happens with the weather. But its vintage features including the Snowflake Lounge where après-skiers dance on snowflake-pattern carpet, echo Boyne’s early days as a getaway for singles. Old photos displayed in vitrines devoted to memorabilia in Stein Ericksen’s restaurant capture outdoor parties and couples in a steaming swimming pool beside the slopes, where one exists today.

Boyne Mountain is minutes from Walloon Lake where Ernest Hemingway spent boyhood summers at his family’s home, and 15 miles from Petoskey where the author was known to drink at the City Park Grill. But I’ve always thought it was another author, Michigan-born Jim Harrison, who best captured the allure of the north.

“Looking at the Manitous on a winter walk is worth any self-help book save the Bible,” he once wrote of the offshore Manitou Islands in Lake Michigan.

Image Credit The New York Times

You can’t see the Manitous from the top of Boyne Highlands, Mr. Kircher’s follow-up Michigan effort, established in 1963, but you can see the peninsula-spanning Mackinac Bridge to the north. As a second-generation Boyne resort, the Highlands is more spacious, now encompassing more than 4,000 acres with a significant devotion to golf and real estate sales. The company encourages two-resort vacations by offering interchangeable lift tickets and allowing equipment rentals at one resort to be returned at either.

Between the two ski areas in Petoskey, the company also owns the waterfront Inn at Bay Harbor, modeled on grand 19th-century resorts. Here, skiers are warmly welcomed — every bellman I met asked about the ski conditions — and a free shuttle to Petoskey’s historic Gaslight District, just shy of four miles away, encourages guests to explore.

Summer’s high tide of visitors largely supports the proliferation of independent shops and restaurants in Petoskey, where one of the typically literate salespeople at McLean & Eakin Booksellers spent 10 minutes extolling “The Sellout” by Paul Beatty when he learned I’d loved “The Underground Railroad” by Colson Whitehead. Seasonal staff goes with the tourists, which is why the bartender serving the house-made sour ale at Beards Brewery was the owner himself. Among other off-season rewards, I walked into the tiny Chandler’s restaurant, a culinary sophisticate disguised in knotty-pine paneling, and wound up at the bar between a local landscape designer and a chef who claimed the quiet was welcome.

“Winter is our season of recovery,” he said.

On the clearest, coldest and most breathtaking day of the trip, the snow glinted in the sunshine at Boyne Highlands, where eight lifts range across two mountains. The view from the central ridge takes in iced-over Little Traverse Bay in one direction and the peaked red roofs of the alpine base village in the other. “Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan played on outdoor speakers, setting a mellow tone.

When he arrived from Austria in 1976, Tony Sendlhofer, then a new recruit to the ski school staff, looked at the 552-foot vertical drop and wondered where the mountain was. “But it wasn’t about that,” he said. “I always wanted to come to the U.S.”

He took up the mantle of the Austrian tradition here and has since taught generations of families how to ski, how to enjoy the outdoors in winter and, most infectiously, how to make the most of where you are.

“Come on,” he said, waving an insulated mitten toward the empty Kath Run below us. “Let’s make some turns.”

They occupy different realms, and my faith has a far more important and cherished place in my life than politics. Yet both are significant to me, and the two spheres are not entirely distinct.

Some of the most impressive moral movements in American politics — the efforts to abolish slavery and to end segregation and the struggle to protect unborn life — have been informed by Christianity. Two of the monumental figures in the latter half of the 20th century, Reagan and Pope John Paul II, together helped to bring down one of the most malevolent political movements in history: Soviet-led Communism.

More recently, the global AIDS and malaria initiative is one of President George W. Bush’s greatest legacies; more than 13 million people are on lifesaving antiretroviral treatment as a consequence. This, too, was a policy that came about in response to human sympathies that were shaped in large part by the faith of Mr. Bush and some of his key advisers.

I don’t mean to imply that politics and religion are a perfect fit. Often they’re not, and over the years Christians, myself included, have not gotten the balance right. But overall I felt that the Republican Party and the evangelical movement were imperfect forces for good, and I spent a large part of my life defending them.

Yet the support being given by many Republicans and white evangelicals to President Trump and now to Mr. Moore have caused me to rethink my identification with both groups. Not because my attachment to conservatism and Christianity has weakened, but rather the opposite. I consider Mr. Trump’s Republican Party to be a threat to conservatism, and I have concluded that the term evangelical — despite its rich history of proclaiming the “good news” of Christ to a broken world — has been so distorted that it is now undermining the Christian witness.

Just the other day I received a note from a friend of mine, a pastor, who told me he no longer uses the label “evangelical” to describe himself, even though he meets every element of its historical definition, “because the term is now so stained as to ruin my ability to be what evangelicalism was supposed to be.”

Another pastor who is a lifelong friend told me, “Evangelical is no longer a word we can use.” The reason, he explained, is that it’s become not a religious identification so much as a political one. A third person, who heads a Christian organization, told me the term evangelical “is now a tribal rather than a creedal description.” In October, the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship, a campus ministry for more than 80 years, changed its name to the Princeton Christian Fellowship. “We’re interested in being people who are defined by our faith and by our faith commitments and not by any sort of political agenda,” according to Bill Boyce, who has led the campus group for decades.

There are of course a great many honorable individuals in the Republican Party and the evangelical movement. Those who hold different views than I do lead exemplary lives. Yet I cannot help believing that the events of the past few years — and the past few weeks — have shown us that the Republican Party and the evangelical movement (or large parts of them, at least), have become what I once would have thought of as liberal caricatures.

Assume you were a person of the left and an atheist, and you decided to create a couple of people in a laboratory to discredit the Republican Party and white evangelical Christianity. You could hardly choose two more perfect men than Donald Trump and Roy Moore.

Both have been credibly accused of being sexual predators, sometimes admitting to bizarre behavior in their own words. Both have spun wild conspiracy theories, including the lie that Barack Obama was not born in America. Both have slandered the United States and lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, with Mr. Moore declaring that America today could be considered “the focus of evil in the modern world” and stating, in response to Mr. Putin’s anti-gay measures in Russia: “Well, maybe Putin is right. Maybe he’s more akin to me than I know.” Both have been involved with shady business dealings. Both have intentionally divided America along racial and religious lines. Both relish appealing to people’s worst instincts. Both create bitterness and acrimony in a nation desperately in need of grace and a healing touch.

I hoped the Trump era would be seen as an aberration and made less ugly by those who might have influence over the president. That hasn’t happened. Rather than Republicans and people of faith checking his most unappealing sides, the president is dragging down virtually everyone within his orbit.

In the latest example of this, a rising number of Republicans are attempting to delegitimize the special counsel’s investigation into whether there were links between Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Mr. Putin’s Russia because they quake at what he may find. Prominent evangelical leaders, rather than challenging the president to become a man of integrity, have become courtiers. What’s happening with Mr. Moore in Alabama — with the president, the Republican National Committee, the state party and many white evangelicals rallying around him — is a bridge too far for many of us. Where exactly is the bottom? And at what point do you pull back from associating yourself with a political party and a religious term you once took pride in but that are now doing harm to the things you treasure?

Institutional renewal and regeneration are possible, and I’m going to continue to push for them. But for now a solid majority of Republicans and self-described evangelicals are firmly aboard the Trump train, which is doing its utmost to give a seat of privilege to Mr. Moore. So for those of us who still think of ourselves as conservative and Christian, it’s enough already.",Why I Can No Longer Call Myself an Evangelical Republican,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/opinion/sunday/wehner-evangelical-republicans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

On Tuesday we’ll learn whether Alabama voters care if their next U.S. senator is an accused pedophile with a long history of dating teens when he was in his 30s.

History would suggest … not so much.

Roy Moore hasn’t pulled out a gun at any rallies lately, but he’s still the person you’d least like your daughter to run into in the Gadsden Mall. Women have charged, with what seems like extreme credibility, that he sexually assaulted them when they were 14 and 16. You’d think that would be enough to do him in.

Yet the chronicles of American politics are absolutely stuffed with stories about politicians who shocked their constituents with bad behavior, generally along the sexual line, without being punished at the polls.

At this very moment, the House of Representatives includes Scott DesJarlais, a physician and a staunch opponent of abortion rights, who was given a new term after voters learned he had dated his patients while still married to his first wife and pressured one of them to get — yes! — an abortion.

Sexual Harassment Training Doesn’t Work. But Some Things Do. Traditional methods can backfire, but ideas like teaching bystanders to intervene and promoting more women have proved effective. Image Credit Lorraine Sorlet

Many people are familiar with typical corporate sexual harassment training: clicking through a PowerPoint, checking a box that you read the employee handbook or attending a mandatory seminar at which someone lectures about harassment while attendees glance at their phones.

At best, research has found, that type of training succeeds in teaching people basic information, like the definition of harassment and how to report violations. At worst, it can make them uncomfortable, prompting defensive jo kes, or reinforce gender stereotypes, potentially making harassment worse. Either way, it usually fails to address the root problem: preventing sexual harassment from happening in the first place.

That’s because much of the training exists for a different reason altogether. Two 1998 Supreme Court cases determined that for a company to avoid liability in a sexual harassment case, it had to show that it had trained employees on its anti-harassment policies.

But while training protects companies from lawsuits, it can also backfire by reinforcing gender stereotypes, at least in the short term, according to research by Justine Tinkler, a sociologist at the University of Georgia. That’s because it tends to portray men as powerful and sexually insatiable and women as vulnerable. Her research has shown this effect no matter how minimal the training. “It puts women in a difficult position in terms of feeling confident and empowered in the workplace,” she said.

Other research found that training that described people in a legal context, as harassers or victims, led those being trained to reject it as a waste of time because they didn’t think the labels applied to them, known as an “identity threat reaction,” said Shannon Rawski, a professor of business at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh. Training was least effective with people who equated masculinity with power. “In other words, the men who were probably more likely to be harassers were the ones who were least likely to benefit,” said Eden King, a psychologist at Rice University.

Training is essential but not enough, researchers say. To actually prevent harassment, companies need to create a culture in which women are treated as equals and employees treat one another with respect.

“Organizations often implement training programs in order to reduce their likelihood of being named in harassment suits or to check a box for E.E.O.C. purposes,” Ms. King said, referring to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “If we’re actually trying to change or reduce the likelihood of sexual harassment, that’s a different outcome altogether. That’s not a knowledge problem, that’s a behavior problem.”

Here are evidence-based ideas for how to create a workplace culture that rejects harassment. Researchers say they apply not just to men attacking women but to other types of harassment, too.

Empower the Bystander

This equips everyone in the workplace to stop harassment, instead of offering people two roles no one wants: harasser or victim, Ms. Rawski said. Bystander training is still rare in corporate America but has been effectively used on college campuses, in the military and by nonprofits.

One study found that soldiers who received the training were significantly more likely than those who did not to report having taken action when they saw assault or harassment. Another found that it changed college students’ attitudes regarding sexual violence and individuals’ ability to stop it, a change measurable both immediately after the training and a year later.

Trainers suggest choices for what to do as a bystander. Most don’t advise confronting the harasser in the moment, because it can escalate and put the bystander in jeopardy. If comfortable doing so, they suggest, a bystander can say something like, “That joke wasn’t funny.”

Another option is to disrupt the situation, such as by loudly dropping a book or asking the victim to come to the conference room. (Charles Sonder, referred to as Snackman in a widely shared video, defused a fight on the subway by standing between the combatants, eating chips.)

Observers can talk to the harasser later, by asking questions but not lobbing accusations: “Were you aware of how you came off in that conversation?” Researchers also suggest talking openly about inappropriate behavior, like asking colleagues: “Did you notice that? Am I the only one who sees it this way?”

One crucial element, researchers say, is for bystanders to talk to targets of harassment. They often feel isolated, and observers might not know if they thought the interaction was consensual or amusing. Colleagues could say: “I noticed that happened. Are you O.K. with that?” If not, they could offer to accompany the victim to the human resources department.

“So many victims blame themselves, so a bystander saying, ‘This isn’t your fault, you didn’t do anything wrong,’ is really, really important,” said Sharyn Potter, a sociologist at the University of New Hampshire who runs a research group there for sexual violence prevention.

Bystanders are unlikely to be present when the most egregious offenses happen, but harassers often test how far they can go by starting with inappropriate comments or touches, said Robert Eckstein, the lead trainer at the research group. A good workplace culture stops them before the offenses get worse.

“Bystander intervention is not about putting on your cape and saving the day,” he said. “It’s about having a conversation with a friend about the way they talk about women.”

Encourage Civility

One problem with traditional training, researchers say, is that it teaches people what not to do — but is silent on what they should do. Civility training aims to fill that gap.

Fran Sepler, who designed new training programs for the E.E.O.C., starts by asking participants to brainstorm a list of respectful behaviors. These often sound trivial, she said, but aren’t common enough, like praising work, refraining from interrupting and avoiding multitasking during conversations. A big one is spotlighting contributions by people who are marginalized. A person could say: “She just raised that same idea. Would she like to expand on it?”

Image Credit Lorraine Sorlet

Ms. Sepler gives people scripts for how to give and receive constructive feedback about rude behavior, so it can be dealt with in the moment. She teaches supervisors how to listen to complaints without being dismissive.

Train Seriously and Often

The most effective training, researchers say, is at least four hours, in person, interactive and tailored for the particular workplace — a restaurant’s training would differ from a law firm’s. It’s best if done by the employees’ supervisor or an external expert (not an H.R. official with no direct oversight).

It also seems to help if white men are involved in the training. A recent paper found that women and minorities are penalized in performance reviews for supporting diversity, while white men are taken more seriously when they do it. Another found a backlash against training when it was done by a woman but not a man.

Training shouldn’t be infrequent, and the topic should come up in conversations about other things, whether strategy or customer service, said KC Wagner, a harassment prevention trainer at Cornell’s ILR School.

“We’re talking about literally generations of people getting away with abusing power,” Mr. Eckstein said. “Thinking you can change that in a one-hour session is absurd. You’re not going to just order some bagels and hope it goes away.”

Promote More Women

Research has continually shown that companies with more women in management have less sexual harassment. It’s partly because harassment flourishes when men are in power and women aren’t, and men feel pressure to accept other men’s sexualized behavior.

It also helps to reduce gender inequality in other ways, research shows, like paying and promoting men and women equally, and including both sexes on teams.

Encourage Reporting

Most women don’t report harassment. Some don’t want to take the risk alone; fear retaliation; don’t know whom to report it to; or don’t think anything will be done. They may not want to end someone’s career — they just want to stop the behavior.

Image Credit Lorraine Sorlet

The E.E.O.C. has suggested a counterintuitive idea: Reward managers if harassment complaints increase, at least initially, in their departments — that means employees have faith in the system. It also recommended giving dozens of people in the organization responsibility for receiving reports, to increase the odds that victims can talk to someone they’re comfortable with.

Ian Ayres, a Yale professor of law and management, has written about using so-called information escrows for harassment reporting. Victims submit a time-stamped complaint against an abuser, and can request that it is reported only if another employee files a complaint against the same person.

Researchers also suggested proportional consequences: Harassers shouldn’t be automatically fired; it should depend on the offense.

“If the penalty is someone’s always going to get fired, lots of targets won’t come forward,” Ms. Rawski said. “But research suggests if you let the small things slide, it opens the door for more severe behaviors to enter the workplace .”

There’s no magic formula for getting into a selective college, but over a decade covering admissions for The Chronicle of Higher Education, I’ve picked up a thing or two. These takeaways, based on hundreds of interviews with admissions deans over the years, may help you navigate the process.

Admissions decisions aren’t all about you.

When colleges choose applicants, they’re juggling competing goals, like increasing diversity and bringing in more revenue. Admissions officers aren’t looking for students who fit just one description — say, those who’ve earned all A’s or won the most awards. So don’t take rejection personally.

Grades and test scores still carry the most weight.

Colleges often say they want to get to know the real you, but that’s probably true only if your academic accomplishments (and the rigor of courses you’ve taken) pass muster.

You’re more than a number.

After colleges identify a big batch of students with outstanding credentials, differences among them become more important, admissions deans say. Among some of the attributes they tell me they would like to see evidence of (in essays, extracurricular activities, recommendations) are: leadership, risk taking, emotional intelligence, fire for learning, critical thinking, curiosity, empathy, optimism, grit, perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles.

Express your authentic self.

Overwhelmed by slick, boastful essays, colleges are eager for what they call “authentic” glimpses of applicants — their experiences, passions and goals. Some deans believe they’ll get deeper insight through alternative formats like videos, pictures, audio files or documents (an Advanced Placement English paper, maybe). A handful of prestigious schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago, Pomona College, Reed College and the University of Rochester, recently introduced this option.

On the surface, Akayed Ullah seemed to be an ordinary member of a Bangladeshi enclave in Brooklyn. He often prayed at a mosque in an unassuming brownstone in the Kensington section of the borough, where a few thousand of his countrymen reside. Like many immigrants in New York, he made his living — at least for a while — driving for a car service.

But on Monday morning, Mr. Ullah, 27, strapped a pipe bomb to his body and set out to detonate it in a Times Square subway station, the police said, not only causing chaos among crowds of commuters, but also leaving behind a trail of mystery that baffled those who knew him.

“He was a good guy,” said Mohammad Yousuf, a cabdriver who prayed with Mr. Ullah at the mosque. “I can’t believe he would do anything like this.”

According to several law enforcement officials, Mr. Ullah said he set off the bomb in retaliation for American airstrikes in Syria and elsewhere, targeting members of the Islamic State, or ISIS. He told investigators that he had been radicalized online and had made a number of trips overseas in the past five years, visiting Bangladesh in recent months, one of the officials said.

Mr. Ullah admitted that he had looked up online how to build the bomb and had assembled it in his residence in Brooklyn, purchasing all of the materials except the pipe, which he said he found at a job site where he was working as an electrician at 39th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, two of the officials said.",Suspect in Times Square Bombing Leaves Trail of Mystery,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/akayed-ullah-port-authority-bombing-suspect.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

When the two started dating in 2013, they both had apartments in Ditmas Park, a Brooklyn neighborhood that met their bucolic requirements. But while they conducted their courtship at Mimi’s Hummus on Cortelyou Road and loved the area’s spacious Victorians, they found the neighborhood too un-urban in one respect: the dearth of train lines. When repair work shut down the Q, it made the neighborhood feel like a small town in the middle of nowhere — and not in a good way.

The House Judiciary Committee’s approval of obstruction charges against Richard Nixon in 1974 does not show otherwise. The Congress then had evidence of specific illegal acts supporting a charge of obstruction, such as the use of “hush money” to silence witnesses. Nixon’s intent or motive while performing otherwise undisputed constitutional responsibilities was not the issue.

It is very much an issue in the case of Donald Trump and possible obstruction in the Russia matter. Yet the establishment of motive is a legal determination that tests Congress’s capacity for thorough, complex investigations of this kind. In the Bill Clinton impeachment process, the House and Senate showed little appetite for any serious investigation. The House conducted no witness depositions, and the Senate only three. The Republican leadership prosecuting the case relied wholly in the House, and primarily in the Senate, on the findings of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Congress may like the security of impeaching for clearly illegal conduct, which helps it fend off the accusation that it is playing politics, but it faces significant limits in these investigative endeavors.

Congress must struggle to function in these inquiries with the necessary secrecy, professional resources and time. It must do all this while containing internal partisan political conflicts and pressures. And it must act while mindful of the sensitivity of a legislative probe into an executive’s motivations when performing otherwise constitutionally authorized acts.

Impeachment is not a substitute for the criminal justice system. In cases like this, it requires the support of that system — the results of professional investigation and judgment.

The attacks on Mr. Mueller, together with Mr. Trump’s lawyers’ embrace of an aggressive legal theory, put in question whether the Department of Justice will be permitted to complete its investigation. Should the president next take the step of firing Mr. Mueller, he would end professionally conducted fact-finding on this crucial question of motive. Congress is then left to respond by trying to complete the department’s job or to proceed to impeachment and a showdown over which branch can claim primacy for its constitutional functions. It faces major challenges in accomplishing the first task, and the second course may lead to constitutional conflict in which, upon impeachment and conviction, the president refuses to vacate his office and the Supreme Court is called on to settle the dispute. Call it Bush v. Gore, the Sequel, another make-or-break case deciding who will be — or, in this instance, remain — president.

The preservation of presidential accountability to the rule of law requires the protection of the department’s role. If the professional prosecutors conclude that they will not bring a charge of obstruction, Congress will have the benefit of the evidence accumulated in the investigation in making its own judgment about impeachment.

Or the special counsel may determine that indictment is justified and proceed to prosecute, which will also force the issue of whether the president can be indicted while in office. The president is highly likely to argue the case for his immunity, but he should have no confidence that he will succeed. Beginning with United States v. Nixon, through later decisions in the Clinton years against presidential claims of privilege or of immunity from civil suit, the courts have stood firmly behind the proposition that the president is not above the law.

Whether or not an investigation concludes with an indictment, Congress will gain the tested evidence that it needs to assess the basis for impeachment for obstruction. Congress and the department would each be able to do what they are cut out to do. Nothing prevents criminal investigations and impeachment processes from running concurrently, as they have in the past.

(The department’s inspector general is investigating what actually happened, because Mnuchin repeatedly claimed to have such an analysis in hand.) If the experts actually did do an analysis, they probably found what everyone else has found — namely, that tax cuts come nowhere near to paying for themselves.

In that case, however, how does Mnuchin manage to claim otherwise? Here’s how the report describes the process: “O.T.P. has modeled the revenue impact of higher growth effects, using the administration projections of approximately a 2.9 percent real G.D.P. growth rate over 10 years.” Notice the carefully deceptive wording. A casual reader might think that O.T.P. is predicting 2.9 percent growth — but what this actually says is that Trump officials simply told the office to assume high growth.

And the assumed acceleration in growth, which comes out of nowhere, is extremely high. It’s many times higher than the Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate, which is itself more optimistic than other estimates. No model I know of, not even those of conservative tax-cut advocates, would predict this much payoff.

In other words, this “analysis” is a sick joke. Why would Mnuchin think he can pull off this scam?

As I said, he probably can’t. But he may be inspired by the example of Paul Ryan, who pulled off similar scams a few years back, fooling much of the news media and even receiving an award for fiscal responsibility from several deficit-scold organizations.

The details of Ryan’s scam were a bit different, but the basic principle was the same. First, tell budget experts to make obviously unrealistic assumptions and estimate what those assumptions would mean for future budget deficits. Then tout the resulting estimates as validation of your plan.

In Ryan’s case the unrealistic assumptions involved revenues and spending, not growth: He simply told experts to assume that he could cut taxes without losing revenue by closing unspecified loopholes, and that he could achieve drastic cost savings without specifying which programs would be cut. And the budget experts were the staff at the Congressional Budget Office, not the staff at Treasury. But the result was the same: Potemkin budget projections that looked great to the casual observer, but had nothing real behind them.

Oh, and the howling mess that is the current G.O.P. tax plan shows what happens when Ryanesque pretense meets reality.

Yet Ryan’s scam worked. He received years of media adulation; that adulation is the main reason he’s now speaker of the House. Even now, news analyses tend to depict the irresponsibility and incompetence of Republican tax plans as some kind of deviation from Ryan’s past behavior, not its natural continuation.

In fact, you almost have to feel sorry for Mnuchin: Yes, he’s an obvious buffoon, but his scam isn’t really any worse than Ryan’s. Why can’t he pull it off?

The larger point is that the dishonesty and dysfunctionality of current Republican efforts at tax “reform,” the party’s evident inability to govern in a serious way, didn’t come out of nowhere. Republicans have been heading in this direction for years.

That kind of event can change one’s perspective, and for the photographer Cig Harvey, her brush with vehicular death in 2015 inspired her new series “You an Orchestra You a Bomb,” recently released by Schilt Publishing, which also opens as a solo exhibition at Robert Mann in New York on December 7. With its strong emphasis on evocative color and objects culled from the natural world, the project touches upon magic, mystery and fairy tales. One easily imagines Narnia just through the wardrobe door or Hogwarts awaiting at the end of the train ride. (Surprisingly, Ms. Harvey, who was born in England, has never read the Harry Potter books.)

As is her custom, the series features Ms. Harvey’s six-year-old daughter, Scout, along with other relatives and friends. And the narrative is clearly propelled by the motivations of a mother, one enraptured by life after a near-death experience.

“The spark was ignited after I was in a serious car accident,” she said. “Then I started to make work about my relationship to life itself, and how fragile that felt in that moment.”

Photo

While her previous projects, including the books “Gardening at Night” and “You Look At Me Like An Emergency,” featured images that were preconceived and carefully constructed, Ms. Harvey began shooting in a more documentary style after her accident, roaming around with a camera in hand. While she still poses her subjects, her creativity pushed her to explore the world further, and to allow life to present serendipitous moments, like an old man jumping from a dock into the sea, or a pregnant friend standing stock-still on a misty beach.

“Every day, I sought out in everyday places images that made me jolt; that created some type of awe, and made me gasp because it was so beautiful,” she said. “And most of them are just in my backyard.”

Her book and exhibit carefully recreate that sense of childhood wonder, mixing saturated colors with verdant symbols and engaging text, allowing viewers to contemplate that sense of the unknown, but from a place of joy rather than anxiety. Ms. Harvey’s stories — poetic interludes sprinkled through the photographic narrative — add to the feeling that one has climbed into the back of her head, like in the film “Being John Malkovich,” and reality is twisted as a result.

Photo

Whether it’s a child’s tooth tied to red string, a platter of four-leaf clovers, a box full of butterflies, or a table covered with tangerines, that feeling of rapture, of youthful exuberance, permeates the pages. One vignette sums up her obsession with magic — with the things we feel but cannot understand:

“At a science-themed birthday I sit with the 5-year-olds in the front row, gasping at the impossibility of it all. / I keep mixing up science and magic. / Please do let me stop you, as you begin to explain the physics.”

Other artists, notably Sally Mann, have featured their children as a way of exploring universal themes, but the young women in this book seem like stand-ins for storybook characters. Whether they’re holding dead bugs or peeking out from behind a red curtain, the feeling is hard to escape, particularly with an image near the book’s end that features Scout dressed in a cape like Little Red Riding Hood.

Because tragedy is always with us, fairy tales have traditionally dealt with themes of life and death in exaggerated ways, so to explain difficult ideas to children. As a mother, Ms. Harvey is clearly grappling with these issues that suffuse her photographs.

Photo

“I became a better photographer when I became mother, and by better, I mean the work got more complicated and less decorative, because my world became more complicated,” she said. “The world became more beautiful, and it also became more terrifying. This book is about those two extremes.”

In the end, that’s what Ms. Harvey hopes people will get from “You an Orchestra You a Bomb” — a sense of being transported and, in turn, transformed by a perspective that helps them appreciate the ephemeral quality of life.

“Everything feels very temporary,” she said. “We have these short lives. How can we pack as much into them, and love fiercely, protect fiercely, give fiercely, deal with difficult things, and come through other side?”

With the size and variety to engage skiers for weeks, the ski industry’s big players like Aspen and Vail resorts dominate the imaginations of winter sports fans across the country. A total of 479 ski resorts operated last winter in the United States, according to the National Ski Areas Association, tallying 54.7 million skier and snowboarder visits, up 3.7 percent from the previous year.

However, it’s the many the underdogs — smaller operators ranging from city neighbors like Mountain Creek in Vernon, N.J., to remote snow-blessed areas like Wolf Creek Ski Area in Southern Colorado — that play an important role in the ski universe, often as teaching hills and budget alternatives.

“The substantial percentage of the most die-hard skiers started somewhere small,” said Evan Reece, the chief executive and co-founder of Liftopia, an online service offering discounts on lift tickets, equipment rentals and more. When it comes to beginner lessons, small ski areas are “lower cost, higher touch and require less commitment,” he added.

While single-day lift passes can cost more than $150 at major resorts, access tends to be cheaper at lesser-known areas. And resorts within driving distance spare skiers airline tickets, expenses that particularly add up when it comes to family ski trips.

In West Virginia, just over two hours from Washington, D.C., Canaan Valley Resort dangles the proposition of a two-season vacation. It will keep its golf course open this winter, weather permitting, for the first time, potentially offering visitors the chance to ski and tee up on the same day. The resort also increased its snow-making capacity by 140 percent over the past two years. The runs, with an 850-foot vertical drop, overlook the valley floor, home to the 18-hole golf course.

Seek more novelty at Montage Mountain Resorts in Scranton, Pa. The ski area claims to have the largest airboarding program in the country. By airboarding, similar to sledding on an inflatable raft, riders can reach up to 60 miles per hour on downhill runs. The resort also offers “First Timer Fridays,” which include a free lift ticket, rental equipment and lesson to first-time skiers and snowboarders.

In New Hampshire’s central White Mountains, Waterville Valley Resort added a peak in 2016. This year, $3 million went into snow-making upgrades, three new lifts, base lodge renovations and a new radio-frequency system for lift tickets.

In the Adirondacks region, two New York state-run ski areas are getting upgrades designed to make them more competitive with world-class ski resorts in the east, such as Killington in Vermont. Gore Mountain in North Creek is rebuilding and expanding its lodges at the base, mid-mountain and summit. In 2016, it began using energy from more than 14,000 solar panels. Whiteface Mountain at Lake Placid is expanding its ski school, renovating two lodges at the base of the mountain and adding a warming hut on the mountain top.

Colorado is home to more than two dozen ski resorts including international draws like Snowmass and Breckinridge. But thanks to the Rocky Mountains, even beloved locals’ resorts like Eldora Mountain Resort near Boulder have long runs and elevations over 10,000 feet. Reachable via public bus, the 680-acre Eldora plans to add a high-speed, six-passenger chairlift this winter, with a ride time of less than five minutes. Mindful of its entrepreneurial clientele, the resort is adding free Wi-Fi in its two base lodges.

Mountain-mad Coloradans appreciate Arapahoe Basin, just over 60 miles west of Denver, for its extremely long season, running October to June. This year it is introducing 468 skiable acres, bringing the resort to 1,400 acres. Most of the new terrain can be reached via ski lift, with its most challenging area accessible by hiking in.

In Northern California, Sugar Bowl Resort has plenty of competition from nearby Lake Tahoe resorts. Over the past two years the Donner Summit area has invested $6 million in snow grooming and removal and a new children’s ski and snowboard school. The San Francisco chef Traci Des Jardins is newly overseeing the food and developing new menus for three restaurants. The 1939 vintage Sugar Bowl acquired the cross-country-ski resort Royal Gorge in 2013 and has upgraded its trails and plans to add an interactive trail map on its website with conditions and marked routes.

For skiers seeking to do some uphilling or skinning, as the practice of walking up a mountain in skis outfitted with no-slip skins and special bindings is called, Mt. Shasta Ski Park, about 65 miles north of Redding, will newly allow it beginning in January. The resort also offers a combined Nordic and Alpine skiing ticket.

For those seeking space on the slopes, Powder Mountain, about 55 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah, has promised to cap the maximum number of day passes sold to 1,500 and season passes to 3,000. That’s low density in a ski area with 8,464 acres. Powder Mountain records an average snowfall of 500 inches, and the addition of two lifts last year helps expedite transit to it.

It’s worth the trip to Bozeman, Mont., to reach Big Sky Resort for its uncrowded runs spread across 5,800 acres. It may not remain that way long.

Last year two chairlifts were replaced, and this year its four surface lifts used to transport beginners uphill were also replaced.

In the Canadian Rockies, you might be tempted to stop at the ski areas around Banff National Park, but press on west of Calgary nearly 200 miles to Panorama Mountain Resort in British Columbia, especially if you’re an expert skier. This season it will add 128 acres to its backcountry Taynton Bowl, creating four double-black-diamond trails and the resort’s longest run at four miles.

Along the so-called Powder Highway of southern British Columbia, Whitewater Ski Resort in the Selkirk Mountains near Nelson is expanding this year with a new quad chairlift, a new base lodge to house its ski school and a renovation of its existing lodge.

In Jasper National Park in Alberta, Marmot Basin is adding an area called Tres Hombres, a north-facing, treeless and very steep slope of about 54 acres. Its five new runs are designed for expert skiers and snowboarders.

In eastern Canada’s Charlevoix region, about 90 miles east of Quebec City, Mont Grand-Fonds is often overshadowed by the larger Le Massif de Charlevoix, but it doesn’t lack variety. Its new off-trail area known as the Lynx can be reached by lift or by skinning up an appointed trail.

Pittsburgh — Of all the questions that the ascendancy of Donald Trump has raised — on the value of political experience in governing, on the fitness of business executives as government executives or the profile of the Republicans as defenders of the rich and the Democrats as the sentinels of the poor — none is as perplexing as perhaps the central question of the age:

Does the truth still matter?

It emerged again recently when reports surfaced that the president, who had previously acknowledged his presence on the “Access Hollywood” videotape, has suggested that he did not make the comments on the tape. He also resumed questioning whether Barack Obama was born in the United States — despite having said he accepted it as true last year. In a speech, Mr. Trump, contradicting almost every analysis of the tax bill, said the measure would hurt wealthy people, including himself.

For nearly a half-century in journalism, from hometown cub reporter to national political correspondent to metro daily executive editor, I’ve navigated with the aid of a newspaperman’s North Star: the conviction that there is such a thing as objective truth that can be discovered and delivered through dispassionate hard work and passionate good faith, and that the product of that effort, if thoroughly documented, would be accepted as the truth.

Mr. Trump has turned that accepted truth on its head, sowing doubts about the veracity of news reporting by promoting the notion that the mainstream media spews “fake news.” Employing an evocative, sinister phrase dating to the French Revolution and embraced by Lenin and his Soviet successors, he has declared that great portions of the press are the “enemy of the people.”

Much of the Trump rhetoric on the press, to be sure, is less statecraft than stagecraft, designed to dismiss negative stories — as if the media had been never critical of past presidents instead of the equal-opportunity pugilists who bedeviled Bill Clinton (in the Monica Lewinsky episode) and George W. Bush (in the aftermath of the Iraq war).

Mr. Batali had also recently been reprimanded because of a complaint made in October by an employee at one of the more than 20 restaurants in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, a company spokesman said on Monday.

The spokesman said that Mr. Batali had been required to undergo sexual harassment training above what is already required of employees. He then volunteered to keep away from the restaurant where the employee worked, and he has done so, said the spokesman, who declined to be identified by name.

The spokesman would not name the restaurant where the woman worked, and it was not immediately clear whether the employee was among the women interviewed in the Eater report.

After the Eater report was released on Monday, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group said in a statement that it had taken further measures that extended to all his restaurants.

“Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and he has already done so,” it said. It also said that the company had provided employees with access to an outside investigations firm if they want to make claims against corporate officers or owners.

“ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment,” the statement said. “While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”

The allegations against Mr. Batali were among the latest to be made against prominent men in several industries following a New York Times report in October about women accusing the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment.

The revelations about Mr. Batali have shaken up the food industry, where he is also a best-selling author of cookbooks. He has long appeared as a television personality in cooking competitions, including “Iron Chef America” and “Top Chef.”

Last year, he was enlisted by Michelle Obama to put together the last state dinner of the Obama presidency.

The allegations concerning Mr. Batali drew quick response from the food industry, including suggestions that such behavior was widespread.

Tiffani Faison, an American chef who was a finalist on the first season of Bravo’s reality show “Top Chef,” suggested that there was a culture of silence in professional kitchens.

“I cannot believe we are in a true watershed moment when NOT ONE MAN has gotten ahead of allegations,” she wrote on Twitter. “They all know what they did and are just hoping their number doesn’t come up. That is the opposite of integrity.”

Like many of Mr. Batali’s colleagues, Traci Des Jardins, the San Francisco chef and restaurateur who has known Mr. Batali since the late 1980s, was conflicted about the reports.

She and others expressed sympathy for the thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the Batali brand, as they did when allegations surfaced against John Besh, the high-profile New Orleans restaurateur, in October. In that city, people have vowed not to go to Mr. Besh’s restaurants, and calls for boycotts of Mr. Batali’s restaurants arose, although some expressed caution about such a boycott, saying it would hurt workers who had nothing to do with his behavior.

The chef and television personality Tom Coliccho, who has been one of the few male chefs speaking publicly about sexual harassment in the restaurant business since news about Mr. Weinstein and others came out, said he was not surprised to hear about Mr. Batali.

“Am I supposed to report rumor and innuendo and suspicion?” he asked. “It’s not my story to tell. This is about the women and it damages the ‘me, too’ movement if we don’t let them speak for themselves.”

Mr. Batali is among a small group of chefs who helped diners deftly navigate a transition from decades of Eurocentric dining to one more distinctly American, and became a celebrity doing it.

Although Italian-American chefs had long been cooking regional specialties, Mr. Batali is largely credited with educating an entire nation on the delights of tripe, beef cheek ravioli and spicy squid through his restaurants and his first television show, “Molto Mario,” which ran from 1996 to 2004.

He was raised outside of Seattle, where his family still lives and operates Salumi, a widely praised cured meat shop in Pioneer Square. After graduating from Rutgers University and training in kitchens in Italy, he moved to New York in 1992. From there he built an international empire with his partner Joe Bastianich that, in addition to more than 20 restaurants, includes the Eataly Italian market franchise and a television career that ranged from scrappy shows when Food Network was in its infancy to a regular spot on “The Chew.”

At his first restaurant, the tiny Po in Greenwich Village, he made his name with fresh pastas and other dishes that, while not quite authentically Italian, were brightly flavored and deeply appealing. Po opened in 1993, when most American food lovers were just beginning to understand the world of Italian food in between the two poles of red-sauce “Southern” and cream-rich “Northern.”

In 1998, he opened Babbo Ristorante in New York’s West Village. It was an immediate hit, receiving three stars from Ruth Reichl, then the New York Times food critic. His white-tablecloth place in the meatpacking district, Del Posto, was the first Italian restaurant to earn four stars from The New York Times, bestowed by Sam Sifton.",Mario Batali Steps Away From Restaurants Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/dining/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct.html

Our reporters examined why Mr. Trump, who has also faced sexual harassment and assault allegations, has stood by Mr. Moore while the Alabama race split national Republicans. Many of his party’s national leaders have said that Mr. Moore should drop out of the race, which veteran Alabama politicians describe as unlike any they’ve ever seen.

The dean of the state’s congressional delegation, the Republican Senator Richard C. Shelby, excoriated Mr. Moore in a rare national television appearance on Sunday, telling CNN that Alabama “deserves better.”

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader — who has said “I believe the women” and took the stand for weeks that Mr. Moore should drop out of the race — said last week that the race was for the people of Alabama to decide.

Mr. McConnell’s colleagues have discussed the possibility that, if Mr. Moore is elected, he could be subjected to an ethics investigation, or even expelled from the Senate.

In a tight race, any votes cast for a little-known write-in candidate, Lee Busby, might affect the outcome.

What do voters think?

Mr. Moore’s solid lead in voter surveys evaporated just after the scandal broke, but his poll numbers later edged upward again. Conflicting polls have highlighted how difficult it is to predict an unusual December election.

How are Democrats responding?

National Democratic organizations and the party’s most prominent figures had largely steered clear of the race, our political correspondents reported, which had initially left Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, to mostly go it alone. But in the last, frenzied days of the campaign, a constellation of outside liberal groups discreetly launched a multimillion-dollar operation to get out the Democratic vote. Mr. Jones is relying heavily on turnout by black voters.

321,"['letter', 'civil', 'woman', 'schools', 'takedown', 'state', 'rights', 'sexual', 'students', 'title', 'ix']","Colleges responded by creating new Title IX offices and drafting individual policies that varied from school to school.
Although Drake’s Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school’s requested time, the dean still spoke.
“They basically put in writing: ‘We’re not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,’ ” Rossley says.
While advocates may refute Ehrhart’s suggestion that Title IX is now a state issue — unless Title IX and the Clery Act are overturned, state laws conflicting with them will be challenged in court — they concede that they can’t stop emboldened conservative legislatures from trying.
And that’s no accident, say advocates, many of whom have long warned that an attack on Title IX could enable similar attacks on Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act clause that forbids racial discrimination in schools, on which Title IX was modeled.","A decade ago, Title IX was better known as the law that forbade schools to banish women’s sports teams to the parking lot while men got the fields. Schools were required to address campus sexual assault under both Title IX and the 1990 Clery Act — a federal law, named for a Lehigh University freshman raped and killed in her dorm room, that requires colleges to report all campus crimes — but schools were only rarely sanctioned under the act, and few students knew how to lodge Title IX complaints. Reporting to law enforcement offered little help: Federal statistics compiled by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network show that only 310 out of 1,000 rapes are reported to the police. Just 11 of those are referred for prosecution, and just seven lead to felony convictions. Even if the criminal-justice system pursued sexual-assault allegations more aggressively, college victims would still have to face the accused on campus as investigations and prosecutions drag on for months, or even years.

In 2011, following an investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity on campus assault, the Obama administration decided to act. The Office for Civil Rights sent a “dear colleague letter” reminding colleges that sexual harassment and assault create an environment so hostile that women’s access to education is jeopardized, violating their civil rights. The letter noted a commonly cited (though commonly challenged) statistic from the National Institute of Justice that one in five women are victims of attempted or actual sexual assault during college. A subsequent clarification of the letter created no uniform policy for how schools should adjudicate cases, but it offered recommendations like having schools inform students that drinking “never makes the survivor at fault for sexual violence” and discouraging colleges from allowing either party to directly cross-examine the other in investigations. Schools that failed to uphold standards risked losing federal funds.

Colleges responded by creating new Title IX offices and drafting individual policies that varied from school to school. Some universities use hearings; others employ a “single investigator” model, in which a school designee is responsible for both investigating and making a determination. More typical is something like this: After students disclose an assault to a “responsible employee,” that staff member must relay it to the Title IX officer, who determines whether a full investigation is warranted. If it is, the officer taps a staff member or external investigator who has been trained in Title IX procedures to contact the parties, interview witnesses and gather evidence. Complainants are asked to participate, but schools can proceed without them if they decide the claim poses a larger threat on campus. A report is produced that each party can comment on, and panel hearings are held. Until this September, Office for Civil Rights rules stipulated that all of this needed to happen within 60 days, and afterward, the parties could appeal.

Campus reporting of sexual misconduct spiked significantly, and that increase led to an outcry from conservative media, including writers for National Review and Town Hall, which argued that the guidance letter made accusations as good as a verdict. The day the Office for Civil Rights sent its letter, the federal government made “all sex unsafe on campus,” the libertarian magazine Reason said.

The most widespread criticism was that the letter forced schools to lower their standard of proof when assessing claims, to the “preponderance of evidence” standard commonly used in civil lawsuits. Unlike the higher standard used in some civil trials, which require “clear and convincing evidence,” or the highest standard used in criminal trials, which require certainty “beyond reasonable doubt,” preponderance is often described as 50.01 percent certainty of guilt. If an accused student is found more likely than not to have committed the offense, he or she is “responsible,” in the parlance of campus hearings. While there were exceptions before 2011 — schools that used “clear and convincing” or, in a few instances, “beyond reasonable doubt” — preponderance was used in about 80 percent of colleges that had any fixed standard.

Victims’ advocates argued that it followed an established legal principle: In civil cases, where criminal penalties aren’t on the line, the burden of proof is lower. But critics viewed the mandate to use preponderance as a means to finding more accused students responsible, and the standard became a sort of shorthand — that college men were no longer presumed innocent and were being expelled en masse over “regret sex.”

It was an oversimplification, but also one that reflected real problems in the process. To Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a nonpartisan nonprofit that works on free speech, religious liberty and due process in higher education, the larger issue is that the lower standard exists within a “parallel judicial system” that lacks other due-process protections — like the consistent right for attorneys to meaningfully participate in hearings and access to the legal procedures to investigate complex cases. Schools can’t subpoena witnesses to compel relevant testimony or put people under oath; they rarely have access to forensic evidence or processes for discovery.

“O.C.R.’s rationale” was that preponderance of evidence “was the standard for suits alleging civil rights violations like sexual harassment,” wrote Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge and current Harvard law professor, in The American Prospect in 2015. “True enough, except for the fact that civil trials at which this standard is implemented follow months if not years of discovery.” She continued: “It is the worst of both worlds, the lowest standard of proof coupled with the least protective procedures.”

In 2016, FIRE, which had been connecting accused students with lawyers and offering a class to attorneys on handling complaints, put out a recruitment call for plaintiffs to sue the Department of Education over the guidance letter. There was already an abundance of lawsuits against schools — at least 190, according to the men’s advocacy group Title IX for All. Typically, victims’ complaints about mishandled Title IX cases have gone to the Office for Civil Rights, while complaints from accused men land in civil court. In a ruling involving Brown University last year, a Rhode Island judge noted: “A student is not entitled to a perfect disciplinary process, and it is not the court’s role to be an appeals court for Brown’s disciplinary decisions.” At the time, no circuit courts had weighed in, but there were so many cases it seemed one would have to. This September, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did so, finding that the University of Cincinnati violated an accused student’s due-process rights by failing to let him cross-examine his accuser.

With funding from right-wing donors like the Charles Koch Institute, FIRE has often aligned with conservative sensibilities. But a number of academics and lawyers, among them a group of feminist Harvard law professors (including Gertner) who released a public letter in August calling for reform, have cited reasons Title IX policies should concern progressives, too: that overly broad definitions of misconduct, encompassing most drunken encounters, threaten to erode distinctions between consensual and nonconsensual sex; that anecdotal evidence (there’s little hard data available) suggests men of color are disproportionately punished; that a conservative administration could co-opt the campus-rape debate to further its own aims; or that perceptions of bias could trigger a backlash casting women as liars.

“I concede I’ve seen cases where it seems schools were taking shortcuts to justice,” says S. Daniel Carter, a longtime campus-safety expert who consults with colleges and universities about sexual misconduct. But schools that did so, he emphasizes, were violating policy or breaking the law. He points to a September 2017 study released by FIRE that found that most top schools fail to consistently ensure 10 safeguards it considers “fundamental elements of due process” — like providing adequate written notice of allegations and the need for impartial fact-finders. With the exception of two items on FIRE’s list — one calling for a presumption of innocence, which Carter believes violates Title IX’s requirement that adjudicators make no presumptions whatsoever — Carter says not only that he agrees with every principle but also that each is already required by Title IX, the Clery Act or the guidance letter.

In the case of Thomas Rossley, which Andrew Miltenberg joined when father and son decided to sue, the Rossleys contend that Drake violated some of these policies. The school’s acting dean was afforded equivalent speaking time as Thomas and his accuser — effectively doubling the amount of time allowed to make the case against Thomas, which the Rossleys argue is a violation of Office for Civil Rights guidelines. Although Drake’s Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school’s requested time, the dean still spoke. “They basically put in writing: ‘We’re not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,’ ” Rossley says. (In a court filing, Drake denies violating any rules or procedures.)

Victims’ advocates say that cases like this illustrate that the problem isn’t the policy but rather schools’ failing to follow it. A situation where a school gave more time to one party than the other, says Alexandra Brodsky, a fellow at the National Women’s Law Center, would be “both a clear error by the school and points to a need for a more nuanced conversation about Title IX enforcement than ‘Is Title IX good or bad?’ ”

“For my entire career, I’ve seen the pendulum swing,” Carter says. For decades, schools followed “the path of least resistance,” he says, to the detriment of victims. More recently, some followed the same path to the disadvantage of the accused. Now that pattern of reaction and counterreaction is happening at the national level. “It’s not back and forth so much as it’s the same old failed system,” Carter says. “Who is it failing the most today?”

“It’s becoming, I don’t know if ‘circus’ is the right word,” says Laura L. Dunn, the executive director of the national victims’ rights group SurvJustice, but “it’s so legally complex that it’s not an easy thing to step into.” School officials are being named in individual lawsuits, so fewer agree to serve on Title IX panels; self-identified victims increasingly need lawyers of their own, because they risk being sued. Advocates on both sides suspect that schools are hedging their bets as they adjudicate, fearing both lawsuits and Office for Civil Rights sanctions.

In the past six months, two different professional attorneys’ associations have reviewed campus sexual-misconduct policy, and a third’s assessment is underway. They’ve come to different conclusions — one proposing higher standards of proof, another access to all evidence for accused students. The American Bar Association task force’s recommendations led to disputes even within the A.B.A. “I don’t think either side of this issue has advocates that are completely imagining problems,” says Cohn, who admits that no proposed solutions — including FIRE’s — come without costs to either side. “There isn’t a perfect, utopian answer to the problem.”

But under the Trump administration, these complexities are being cast largely as a matter of overregulation. Secretary DeVos, who has argued that local authorities and parents should have greater control over education than the federal government, seems to have taken a similar approach with Title IX. When she had one of her first official conversations about Title IX last April, it wasn’t with national experts on either side, but rather with a combative Republican state representative, Earl Ehrhart of Georgia, who has argued that Title IX enables rampant false allegations and that schools have no business investigating sexual assault. Ehrhart came away from his meeting gratified that DeVos seemed to agree with him on the limited role federal authorities should play. “She’s placing this back where it belongs,” he told me, “in the purview of the states.”

In January 2016, Representative Ehrhart, a former chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which drafts model bills for conservative state legislators, decided, after hearing from the distraught mother of an accused student, to make Georgia the testing ground for challenging the “dear colleague letter.” A conservative with a penchant for bomb-throwing who has been lampooned by a Georgia reporter for delivering “Wagnerian” pronouncements, he began with what he called his “Georgia Tech hearing.” At the time, Georgia Tech had a mandatory-expulsion policy for students found responsible for rape, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that it had expelled or suspended more students for sexual misconduct than any other Georgia state school. It also then used the controversial single-investigator model. Ehrhart, as chairman of Georgia’s House Subcommittee on Appropriations for Higher Education, wielded his financial authority like a weapon, effectively denying Georgia Tech funds to expand its libraries and warning other colleges to be more concerned about losing his support than that of the Office for Civil Rights. “If you don’t protect the students of this state with due process,” he said, “don’t come looking for money — period.” Some victims’ advocates believe he leveraged his role again in pushing the state’s Board of Regents to overhaul its sexual-misconduct procedures. The board announced new rules, including banning the single-investigator model, which went into effect in mid-2016.

That April, Ehrhart and his wife, represented by Miltenberg, sued the Department of Education, challenging the dear colleague letter on the claim that Ehrhart’s stepson, a Georgia Tech student, could “be wrongly accused and found responsible.” Then, early this year, Ehrhart proposed a bill, H.B. 51, which initially mandated that any campus sexual-assault report be forwarded to the police, with or without the complainant’s consent, and forbade schools to take final disciplinary action for any possible felony until there was a conviction or a no-contest plea.

The complexity around campus sexual misconduct has led observers from diverse political backgrounds to call for turning the whole matter over to the police. In a forthcoming law-review article, Brodsky notes that since 2013, at least six states and Congress have considered bills that included some form of law-enforcement reporting. Some mandated that schools refer complaints regardless of victims’ wishes; Congress considered a bill that prevented colleges from proceeding with Title IX processes until the police were at least notified, or in some cases, until a conviction was obtained. But no state bill before H.B. 51 took such an extreme approach — or so flagrantly contradicted federal law. And because state bills cannot override federal law, H.B. 51 seemed intended to force a court challenge to the dear colleague letter.

That, Ehrhart acknowledged, was the point. When we met in Atlanta in March, over Chick-fil-A sandwiches, he said he hoped “Georgia will hang a light on the problem such that the O.C.R., the D.O.E., will be put in a position: ‘Here’s a state statutory enactment that’s 180 degrees different from the old guidance letters. What are we going to do?’ ” Given the Trump administration’s signaling its distance from the dear colleague letter, he wagered that if H.B. 51 passed, the new Office for Civil Rights wouldn’t withdraw federal funds. Then other states would see that they could challenge the letter without repercussion and would follow suit.

The H.B. 51 fight was ugly. Hundreds of student protesters went to the state’s Capitol, where legislators challenged women seeking to testify about their assaults during a preliminary hearing. Ehrhart reprimanded one group of victims, saying: “If you feel triggered, trigger somewhere else.” Men’s rights activists showed up to lobby, at times targeting individual activists. They speculated on social media that one student organizer was a “pretty little liar” and brought to the Capitol a man suspended for having assaulted another.

The backlash Ehrhart mobilized created collateral casualties of its own. In his Georgia Tech hearing, Ehrhart read aloud a letter from the mother of a man expelled after being found responsible for rape. The expelled man had sued, and while his accuser wasn’t a defendant, her name and identifying details were in court documents then available to the public. It was a threat that her attorney, Lisa Anderson, who represents victims pro bono as executive director of Atlanta Women for Equality, feared was a new tactic: essentially outing women who lodged Title IX complaints.

There were threads about her case on the school’s Reddit page; riding a bus across campus, she sat in stricken silence as two students discussed it and decided she had probably made it up. Sidelined by panic attacks, she withdrew from most classes by the end of the semester, and though she tried to return last fall, she ended up leaving again and was hospitalized for a week after becoming suicidal. Her G.P.A. slipped so low that she told me she fears that she can’t transfer elsewhere, and that her only chance to graduate is to wait for the current crop of Georgia Tech students to cycle out.

At Kennesaw State University, one woman found that as the Georgia debate around Title IX grew, her case was caught up in the furor. According to her complaint, early one morning in February 2016, she was raped by a male friend, when consensual fooling around ended in nonconsensual intercourse that she explicitly refused. At first, she told me, she thought her friend had merely “disrespected” her clear line. She let him spend the night, and in the morning they ate breakfast, making plans to meet later. The man didn’t call, and the woman, troubled, talked to friends, who told her she was describing rape. Her mother took her to the hospital and the police, and school officials were informed. K.S.U. started an investigation. (The man denied that they had intercourse.)

But over the summer, as the new Board of Regents policy went into effect, the woman claimed the tone shifted. In her last interview, she says, investigators asked whether she was calling the situation rape because the man hadn’t called. Nonetheless, they found him responsible and recommended a two-semester suspension. (The man’s attorney, Lisa Wells, said the K.S.U. office fell out of touch for nearly five months, leading her client to believe the matter had been dropped.)

In the lead-up to a planned hearing in October 2016, the man argued that the investigation had been biased and hadn’t adequately considered his evidence. He asked that his case be reheard under the new regents’ policy and requested a stay of his decision “until the enforceability of the 2011 dear colleague letter has been adjudicated” — suggesting that Ehrhart’s lawsuit might settle the point. The request for a stay was denied, but the school agreed to have an external reviewer assess the case. When they informed the woman, she received a list of new witnesses for the man’s defense; among them was Ehrhart.

“I had no clue who he was or what he could possibly know about somebody raping me,” she said. “As soon as Ehrhart’s name came up, everything went crazy, and they dropped any care they had for me.” As a representative of K.S.U.’s district, Ehrhart had substantial ties to the school. He co-owned a sprawling sports complex that partnered with the university, and when K.S.U. needed a new president in 2016, Ehrhart championed the appointment of the state’s conservative attorney general, Sam Olens, who served with Ehrhart on the board of a K.S.U. business accelerator.

In the fall of 2016, Lisa Anderson, who represents the woman in the K.S.U. case as well, began to notice that email records K.S.U. sent had redactions in the “cc” line — a third party being kept abreast of the case. After filing multiple records requests, Anderson found emails involving Ehrhart, Lisa Wells and Olens. In one, Ehrhart wrote to Olens: “This is the second of the absolutely ridiculous cases I was concerned about. I label this one ‘breakfast with a rapist’ made for TV absurdity.” He noted he was drafting new legislation to remove such “nonsense” cases from university jurisdiction and his belief that “with a new administration in D.C., the guidance letters are now garbage, and the threat of federal funding is off the table.” In closing, he appeared to request a specific outcome: “I also hope this case can be dealt with in an expeditious manner benefiting its absurdity.”

Olens forwarded the email to the K.S.U. Title IX coordinator. When an external reviewer’s report came back in early 2017 — around the same time Ehrhart introduced H.B. 51 — it reversed the initial decision. (Wells says Ehrhart’s emails could not have influenced the external reviewer’s findings because they weren’t forwarded to her. K.S.U. officials said they were unable to comment on a continuing matter.) When Anderson and the woman appealed in the spring and summer, a process that finally culminated in a hearing this October, the panel declared that both parties were equally credible, so it couldn’t find the man responsible. Even before the verdict, the woman had become so despondent that she decided to withdraw. Wells says her own client is suicidal.

Ehrhart’s bill ultimately failed to pass before the legislative session closed in March, staved off largely by the mobilization of student activists. But if he lost the battle, it would come to seem he had won the war. After DeVos rescinded the guidance letter, he was elated. “We’re back to pre-2011,” he told me. “In many ways, we’ve succeeded.”

“We in the advocacy community, who have been involved with Title IX for decades, understand this is nothing short of a catastrophe,” says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, which in 1977 was one of the first organizations to argue in court that sexual harassment violates Title IX. But the exact nature of that catastrophe is not yet clear. The language in the Office for Civil Rights’s rescission letter and interim guidance is vague enough to allow for different interpretations. It might forbid accusers to appeal. Ehrhart hopes for this but acknowledges that “they didn’t make it crystal clear.” A line criticizing the Obama administration’s failure to let schools rely on law enforcement might allow — or push — schools to relegate complaints to the police. The new Office for Civil Rights interim guidance allows schools to choose between the “preponderance” standard or the higher “clear and convincing,” which could open the floodgates to hundreds of students’ demanding their cases be reheard or bringing new lawsuits. DeVos’s comments have already been cited by a man suing the University of Vermont over his suspension for sexual harassment, noting in his lawsuit: “UVM’s procedures for adjudicating sexual-misconduct complaints is precisely the type of system referenced in DeVos’ statement.” (The university says it is “confident it has acted legally and appropriately.”)

Title IX practices may also start to diverge state to state. While advocates may refute Ehrhart’s suggestion that Title IX is now a state issue — unless Title IX and the Clery Act are overturned, state laws conflicting with them will be challenged in court — they concede that they can’t stop emboldened conservative legislatures from trying.

In the week after DeVos’s speech, a bill sped through California’s Legislature, codifying many of the procedural aspects of the 2011 guidance. Although Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill, citing concerns about due process, Farrell predicted it would be just one among numerous state initiatives. At an October meeting of the State Innovation Exchange, a progressive legislative advisory group, there was discussion of potential Title IX legislation in Colorado, Maryland and Massachusetts; in November, a Massachusetts bill mandating better sexual-assault training for campus staff unanimously passed the State Senate.

Attorneys general will also take on a more active role, says Lizzie Ulmer, a member of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, which sent DeVos an open letter in July urging her not to rescind the guidance and has since held meetings to discuss how states can serve as a stopgap against federal changes. Already, Attorney General Andy Beshear of Kentucky has used his office to sue three state universities for concealing records related to sexual harassment or abuse allegations. “The lawsuits that we’re filing are now more critical than ever,” Beshear says. “If the Education Department is not going to be actively monitoring these investigations by our universities under Title IX, it’s going to take other leaders on the state level.” This could create a situation in which protections for students, on either side of an accusation, vary enormously depending where they live. “One thing we have to think about is it really does become a state jigsaw,” Dunn says. “We have a very polarized political debate, and I think states will come out all over the map.”

Calling campus sexual misconduct a state issue is a short step from calling it an issue of states’ rights. And that’s no accident, say advocates, many of whom have long warned that an attack on Title IX could enable similar attacks on Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act clause that forbids racial discrimination in schools, on which Title IX was modeled. The case law around both is intertwined, Dunn says, and their fates are, too: “If you’re rolling back Title IX, the next thing you roll back is Title VI.”

It’s an argument that some conservatives are already making. Days after DeVos withdrew the guidance, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed suggesting that she shouldn’t stop there but should also withdraw a 2014 guidance concerning the disproportionate suspension and expulsion of black and Hispanic students. The same week, the Federalist Society released a report, written in part by individuals who had been active in criticizing Title IX practices, charging that the Obama Department of Education had overreached on three grounds: the guidance on campus sexual misconduct; a 2016 letter, also under Title IX, mandating transgender students’ access to facilities that correspond with their identity; and the 2014 guidance over disparate suspensions of black and Hispanic students. Given that the first two guidance letters were withdrawn by the time the report was published, the next target seemed clear. The conservative think tank Center for Equal Opportunity, two of whose staff members helped write the report, published a blog post with the headline “Two Down, One to Go.”

One advocate, who asked to remain anonymous to describe a closed-door meeting with the Office for Civil Rights, said that Title VI had come up in conversation with Candice Jackson. “We’ve tried to approach them in good faith,” the advocate said, “and I think they’ve used it to unfortunately learn more of what they could undo.” In October, DeVos rescinded 72 additional Department of Education policies related to the civil rights of students with disabilities, an effort, the department said, to eliminate outdated guidance. A few weeks later, department officials met with a group of educators and advocates calling for the rescission of the third Department of Education guidance letter, on disproportionate discipline of students of color. Among them was the lead author of the section of the Federalist Society report calling for the letter’s rescission. And just before Thanksgiving, the department proposed revising its procedures for investigating school civil rights violations to no longer assess whether an individual reported incident could reveal more systemic discrimination, according to a draft document obtained by The Associated Press.

“This is about ending civil rights protections,” Dunn told me. “This is removing what we had a Civil War over, which really was limiting the states in their ability to violate the rights of individuals. The federal government is meant to be a civil rights check, and states have always retained tons of power to fight that check, but they’re trying to erode even that.”

This November, Equal Rights Advocates held the first leadership meeting of the Initiative to End Sexual Violence in Education, a new national network of attorneys and activists to defend Title IX that will train hundreds of new lawyers, establish a hotline to gather complaints and file suit either against schools failing to uphold Title IX rights or on behalf of those who might come under attack from the new Office for Civil Rights. “If the O.C.R. won’t defend Title IX,” Farrell says, “we will.”

This spring, Miltenberg’s phone rang again. On the line was another mother. “You’re not going to take our case,” she said. “You’re for the other side.”

Her daughter, a freshman at a college in upstate New York, said she had been raped during her first semester, after she was separated from friends at a Halloween party and a man she’d never met grabbed and forcibly kissed her. She said he repeatedly asked her to go to his room, and she repeatedly refused. Later, when she was drunk, he offered to help her find her friends, but he said he needed to stop by his dorm first. Once in his room, she said, he immediately undressed. The woman doesn’t remember exactly what happened next, but she found herself naked on his bed. Then he raped her. When she got up to leave, she said, he told her, “Now go back to your room and don’t hook up with anyone else tonight.”

Weeks later, when the woman was out at a local bar, she felt someone staring at her and saw the man again, standing alone and watching her. Over the course of the night, as she moved from room to room to evade him, he followed, ultimately accosting her on the dance floor. (The accused man denies this account and maintains that the sex was consensual.)

By most campus standards, it seemed like a strong case. The woman had text messages she sent friends the night of the rape, saying she needed help; a female friend of the accused man would testify that she stopped by his room and saw the woman there, looking terrified. The same friend said the man asked her to tell campus authorities that everything looked fine. And the woman went to law enforcement.

After she filed a Title IX complaint last December, the woman and her family moved quickly to comply with the office’s requests, pulling together documentation in the weeks before Christmas and participating in a Skype interview on Dec. 18. But after the woman took a medical leave of absence — she struggled after the assault and was beginning therapy — the school’s commitment seemed to flag. By late January, the woman and her family say, officials hadn’t contacted any of the witnesses she suggested, and the accused student wasn’t interviewed until mid-February. The family decided they needed an attorney of their own. But they found lawyer after lawyer who represented only the accused; no one would take their case.

Miltenberg’s partner warned him that taking the case would be career suicide. But over the previous few months, he had started telling fellow Title IX critics that he didn’t think the dear colleague letter should be summarily withdrawn; perhaps it merely needed to be amended. Far from his earlier suggestion that women who don’t want to involve the police shouldn’t report to schools, he began to believe there was no easy way out of requiring colleges to take action. The police are too overburdened, he said, and some cops too “hard-boiled,” to respond to campus sexual assault well. Miltenberg’s new opinions made him unpopular. “I’m left out of a lot of email chains and phone calls now, and I used to be the lead guy,” he says.

He instructed the family to copy him on their communications with the school. The college’s own investigator was a woman Miltenberg says he contended with in the past, when she aggressively defended schools from lawsuits brought by men. The school allowed the male student to withdraw voluntarily on the eve of his hearing — informing the woman that meant the case was closed. “In any case I’ve ever done, the first thing parents ask is: ‘Can we just pull him out?’ ” Miltenberg says. Uniformly, in his experience, schools said no: The process would proceed, with or without the accused, and with findings of responsibility put on his permanent record. (The school says cases like this would result in a notation on the student’s transcript.) Miltenberg took the case.

When he met with the woman and her family in early June, he was shaken. “It was the first time I’ve ever sat with someone who’s a victim, at least in this type of setting,” he says. “I’m used to hearing the other side in detail and trying to come up with the parts that don’t add up, or where the story doesn’t make sense.” When the woman sent him a diary she kept in the months after the rape — a stream-of-consciousness account of the aftermath of losing control of her body — Miltenberg was aghast. As he read the diary, he imagined the voice of his eldest daughter, the same age as his client, and felt like throwing up. “I read this and think, My God, what if this is what every woman who feels they’ve been sexually assaulted feels like?”

As the woman’s lawsuits begin, she is starting her sophomore year at another university far from her first school. When she notified the New York college, she says, officials seemed almost overjoyed to approve her transfer.

When DeVos rescinded the letter in September, Miltenberg released a statement that did not betray any doubts but instead stated that he was “encouraged” by the action. But when he elaborated to me, he sounded more conflicted. Although he was glad more people were talking about the issue, he said he was “having a bit of a crisis of conscience.” Over the months he had worked on the woman’s case, the conventional wisdom about campus sexual assault had changed, with greater public focus on concerns about due process. “And insanely, I’m one of the people, for better or worse, who had some impact on shifting the narrative.” At the same time, he worried that the rescission could lead to a reaction of its own. He had received nearly a dozen new cases — all decided in the weeks immediately surrounding DeVos’s speech — in which he believed the schools had meted out unduly harsh penalties to make “a political counterstatement.” That prospect was as concerning to him as the school’s inaction on his female client’s case.

“There are real topics in this world that are zero-sum games,” he said; finding a balance between addressing sexual assault and ensuring due process didn’t need to be one. He found himself thinking that advocates on either side of the debate shared a sense of battlefield camaraderie, because only they saw what was really going on. “Sometimes you sit in this hearing and your heart breaks for both people,” he said. “Sometimes I walk out and think the whole thing is a [expletive]: terrible for him, terrible for her, terrible for the parents.” It would be disingenuous, he said, not to acknowledge the concerns of the other side: That if the process is broken, it’s broken at least as much for victims as the accused. That correction can become overcorrection in either direction. The pendulum swings both ways. It shouldn’t, he said, “but I don’t know how to stop it.”",The Takedown of Title IX,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/magazine/the-takedown-of-title-ix.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

For most of the year, people inside and outside Washington have been convinced that there is a strategy behind Mr. Trump’s actions. But there is seldom a plan apart from pre-emption, self-defense, obsession and impulse.

Occasionally, the president solicits affirmation before hitting the “tweet” button. In June, according to a longtime adviser, he excitedly called friends to say he had the perfect tweet to neutralize the Russia investigation. He would call it a “witch hunt.” They were unimpressed.

He has bowed to advice from his lawyers by not attacking Mr. Mueller, but at times his instincts prevail.

When three former campaign advisers were indicted or pleaded guilty this fall, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the investigation, urged the president not to respond. If he did, it would only elevate the story.

Mr. Trump, however, could not help himself. He tweeted that the financial charges lodged against his former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, had nothing to do with the campaign and that investigators should be examining “Crooked Hillary & the Dems” instead. By the next morning, he was belittling George Papadopoulos, the campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his outreach to Russians, dismissing him as a “low level volunteer” who has “proven to be a liar.”

He was calm at first when his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty. The next morning, as he visited Manhattan for Republican fund-raisers, he was upbeat. He talked about his election and the “major loser” in the Senate who had said his tax bill would add to the deficit (presumably meaning Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee).

By Sunday morning, with news shows consumed by Mr. Flynn’s case, the president grew angry and fired off a series of tweets excoriating Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I., tweets that several advisers told him were problematic and needed to stop, according to a person briefed on the discussion.

Once he posts controversial messages, Mr. Trump’s advisers sometimes decide not to raise them with him. One adviser said that aides to the president needed to stay positive and look for silver linings wherever they could find them, and that the West Wing team at times resolved not to let the tweets dominate their day.

The ammunition for his Twitter war is television. No one touches the remote control except Mr. Trump and the technical support staff — at least that’s the rule. During meetings, the 60-inch screen mounted in the dining room may be muted, but Mr. Trump keeps an eye on scrolling headlines. What he misses he checks out later on what he calls his “Super TiVo,” a state-of-the-art system that records cable news.

Watching cable, he shares thoughts with anyone in the room, even the household staff he summons via a button for lunch or for one of the dozen Diet Cokes he consumes each day.

But he is leery of being seen as tube-glued — a perception that reinforces the criticism that he is not taking the job seriously. On his recent trip to Asia, the president was told of a list of 51 fact-checking questions for this article, including one about his prodigious television watching habits. Instead of responding through an aide, he delivered a broadside on his viewing habits to befuddled reporters from other outlets on Air Force One heading to Vietnam.

“I do not watch much television,” he insisted. “I know they like to say — people that don’t know me — they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources — you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don’t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I’m reading documents a lot.”

HONG KONG — Amid fears that North Korea is rapidly developing its submarine-launched ballistic missile technology, the United States, Japan and South Korea are teaming up for a drill to track such hard-to-detect missiles, military officials said Monday.

The drills come in the wake of news reports that North Korea is making progress developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBMs. The website 38 North, based at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, obtained images of cylindrical objects, evidence that “suggests construction of a new submarine” at a facility on North Korea’s east coast.

The military maneuvers come a week after the United States and South Korea began holding joint drills that included flyovers of advanced stealth fighters and B1-B Lancer bombers over the Korean Peninsula, exercises that led North Korea to accuse the United States of pushing the region “to the brink of nuclear war.”

To step up pressure, South Korea on Monday imposed a new round of sanctions on 20 North Korean groups and 12 individuals. The sanctions, an effort to curtail North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons programs, were imposed in retaliation for the North’s launching of a missile in late November that experts said was capable of hitting much of the continental United States.",North Korean Submarine Missile Threat Prompts U.S.-Led Military Drills,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/north-korea-submarine-missile.html
