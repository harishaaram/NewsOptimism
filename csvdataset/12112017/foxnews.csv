Christopher Schlosser, 21, has been charged with robbery stemming from an incident that took place on July 27, when he allegedly stormed into a Texas Chicken and Burger location in the Bronx to steal fried chicken and biscuits from behind the counter.

As seen in surveillance footage from inside the restaurant, the suspect’s face was only partially obscured during the robbery. So upon re-entering the eatery on Thursday, an employee was able to identify Schlosser as the same man from the incident.

“He thought we didn’t know him,” said Texas Chicken employee Abdul Mustawu to the New York Daily News. “I told my manager, ‘This guy punched me and took my chicken and my biscuits. I know him. Call the police.”

Police arrived shortly afterward to arrest Schlosser, The New York Post adds.

Oddly enough, this very same Texas Chicken and Burger location was the target of a similar robbery on Wednesday night, when a young couple jumped over the counter to physically assault a 22-year-old employee and steal about $15 worth of food, PIX 11 reports.

In less than five months, the true test of President Trump’s staying power in the Rust Belt will finally be here. A House seat in southwestern Pennsylvania, which voted solidly for Trump in 2016, is up for grabs in a special election on March 13.

Republican Tim Murphy held this seat for 10 years until it was revealed that the politician, who is married and pro-life, asked his mistress to consider an abortion in the midst of a pregnancy scare. The news prompted a national scandal and his ouster this fall.

Now, the first post-Trump election in Appalachia is approaching, and the result could signal how the crucial 2018 midterms will be decided next year. While the special election in Alabama for a senate seat on Dec. 12 is getting all the press, this one could be the real game-changer.

His blood-alcohol level was later tested at a 0.21, more than double the legal limit to drive. A dashboard camera reportedly caught the whole incident, which would normally be a matter of public record.

Travis has made three attempts to prevent the tape from hitting the public. He has been battling health issues since suffering a stroke in 2013.

Once again, a supposed big break in the drive to destroy President Trump over “collusion” with the Russians during the 2016 campaign stands exposed as nothing more than bad reporting. Plus, the professionalism of the FBI looks compromised by anti-Trump bias.

The media went berserk Friday on news that former Trump confidante Mike Flynn had copped a plea deal with special counsel Bob Mueller. All the usual suspects launched an orgy of speculation on what beans Flynn “must” have spilled.

It all went into overdrive when ABC’s Brian Ross reported that Flynn had been instructed to reach out to Moscow during the campaign: This seemed to be the long-awaited proof of collusion with Vladimir Putin against Hillary Clinton.

Except that Ross retracted the claim hours later: The reach-out was only after Election Day, when any president-elect is expected to start connecting with other world leaders, US-friendly or not.

ABC has now suspended Ross for four weeks without pay — modest punishment for an error that probably had a lot to do with the stock market’s dive early Friday.

Meanwhile, news broke of another supposedly neutral dirt-digger in hot water for having a political agenda: Mueller, it turns out, kicked a top FBI agent off his team for apparent anti-Trump bias.

The Justice Department’s inspector general this summer launched a probe of alleged Trump-bashing texts by Peter Strzok, one of the top FBI counterintelligence investigators. That obliged Mueller, already under fire for hiring several pro-Hillary lawyers for his team, to oust Strzok from his Russian-meddling investigation.

Remarkably, the agent had also been a key player in the probe into Clinton’s mishandling of classified information via her secret use of that unsecure private server for all her government work. He’s now in deep freeze with a job at FBI Human Resources.

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Alabama voters conducted Thursday through Sunday using traditional polling techniques, including a list-based probability sample with both landlines and cellphones.
By a 6-point margin, Alabama voters believe the allegations against Moore are true (39-33 percent).
Among just the 46 percent of Alabama voters who are “extremely” interested in the race, the Democrat’s lead widens to 53-40 percent.
And more Democrats plan to vote for Jones (90 percent) than Republicans plan to vote for Moore (81 percent).","Democrat Doug Jones holds a 10-point lead over Republican Roy Moore among likely voters in deep red Alabama.

Greater party loyalty plus higher interest in the election among Democrats combined with more enthusiasm among Jones supporters gives him the advantage in the race to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Alabama voters conducted Thursday through Sunday using traditional polling techniques, including a list-based probability sample with both landlines and cellphones.

Jones receives 50 percent to Moore’s 40 percent, with 1-in-10 undecided (8 percent) or supporting another candidate (2 percent) -- which could make a difference Tuesday. That’s even truer with such an unconventional election with unconventional candidates.

READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS

This race’s uniqueness is significant. It is impossible to know who will show up to vote in a special election to fill a seat in the middle of a term in an off-year. And it’s December, a time when people expect to be going to the shopping mall, not the voting booth.

On top of that, accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore emerged Nov. 9. That’s just a month before the Dec. 12 election. Since then, he has repeatedly denied the allegations, and after the GOP initially pulled its support, the party ultimately backed Moore.

By a 6-point margin, Alabama voters believe the allegations against Moore are true (39-33 percent). They were more evenly divided last month, believing the accusations by just 1 point (38-37 percent). About one quarter, 27 percent, feel it is too soon to say or have no opinion.

Among Republicans, 13 percent believe the accusations are true, 60 percent say they aren’t, and 26 percent are unsure. In November, it was 13-62 percent (26 percent unsure).

President Donald Trump, who won the state by 28 points in 2016, held off endorsing Moore until Dec. 4 -- about a week before Election Day. Yet Alabama’s senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, announced Sunday he didn’t vote for Moore and instead cast a write-in vote.

Jones’s 10-point edge is outside the poll’s 3 percentage-point margin of sampling error. Last month, Jones was ahead by 8 points among likely voters and by 9 among the larger group of registered voters (November 13-15, 2017). In the new poll he’s up by 6 among registered voters.

Among just the 46 percent of Alabama voters who are “extremely” interested in the race, the Democrat’s lead widens to 53-40 percent.

Jones’s lead comes mostly from nonwhites, younger voters, and women. He’s the choice of nonwhites by 76 points (83-7 percent), by 31 points among voters under age 45 (59-28), and by 20 among women (54-34). That jumps to 46 points among women under age 45 (67-21 percent).

More Democrats (50 percent) than Republicans (45 percent) are “extremely” interested in the election. And more Democrats plan to vote for Jones (90 percent) than Republicans plan to vote for Moore (81 percent).

The small subgroup of independents breaks for Jones by 29 points.

Moore is preferred among whites by 20 points (55-35 percent) and whites without a college degree by 33 points (61-28 percent).

Support for Moore among white evangelical Christians is down 8 points since last month: it was 73 percent in November and stands at 65 percent now.

And his advantage among men has dropped from 12 points last month to just 3 points now. In addition, Republican men (41 percent) are less likely than GOP women (50 percent) or Democratic men (53 percent) to be “extremely” interested in the race.

“Moore might prevail if only the people who typically vote in Alabama elections turn out Tuesday, which is often what happens in special elections,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw.

“But this appears to be a special, special election with blacks and young voters animated by a caustic Republican candidate and the chance of winning a statewide election with national implications, and at the same time some Republicans and many moderates are turned off by Moore, too.”

A subtle but potentially noteworthy finding is Alabama voters who were interviewed on cellphones are +30 for Jones, while the race is roughly even among all others. The fact that traditional, high-quality probability samples, like the Fox News Poll, include both landline and cellphone numbers may be why these polls show Jones doing relatively well compared to automated or blended polls.

“It’s clear Jones is positioned to pull off the upset because his supporters are unified and energized, and Moore’s are conflicted and diffident,” says Shaw.

“But Jones is depending on many voters who show up only occasionally to cast their ballots. If their rate of follow-through drops from what we expect, the race could turn. The other factor is the race seems volatile, with a new twist or story every day, and because of this it is difficult to know what Republicans will ultimately do.”

The poll does indeed show enthusiasm is up among Jones supporters and held steady among Moore backers.

Fifty-seven percent of those planning to vote for Moore say they “strongly” support him, which is mostly unchanged from 58 percent in November.

Among Jones supporters, 70 percent “strongly” back him, up from 62 percent.

The portion of Moore supporters who are backing him because they dislike Jones is up 4 points since last month and stands at 13 percent.

Meanwhile, 29 percent of Moore’s supporters say they have reservations about their candidate, while just 13 percent of Jones’s supporters feel that way.

By a 15-point margin, strong moral character is more important to Alabama voters than how the candidate will vote in the Senate (48-33 percent).

For those who say moral character is more important, Jones tops Moore by 60-30 percent. Moore is preferred among those prioritizing how the candidate will vote in the senate by a narrower 54-38 percent.

The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted December 7-10, 2017, by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among a sample of 1,127 voters selected from a statewide voter file in Alabama. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for the full sample of likely voters.

Sharks of this size are not uncommon to both Australia and around the globe. In 2016, a shark estimated to be 23-feet in length was spotted off the coast of southern Australia, according to a report in the National Post.

In 2015, marine biologist Mauricio Hoyos Padilla captured footage of a massive 20-foot great white shark, dubbed Deep Blue, according to a report in National Geographic.

Stephen Smith thanked fans for their support after he almost had his ear gruesomely ripped off in a bloody loss to Francisco Vargas in Las Vegas on Sunday morning.

The British boxer was attempting to get himself back into the world title shot picture in Sin City.

But after suffering the sickening cut to his left ear from an accidental clash of heads the fight was stopped by the ringside doctor after the ninth round.

That left the result up to the judges, who scored 89-82, 88-83, 88-83 in favor of Vargas.

However, it was not the result that everyone was talking about following the 32-year-old Liverpudlian’s defeat.

The sickening images swept around the world, but Smith posted a positive update later on Sunday afternoon.

He wrote: “Thanks very much for all your supportive messages last night, read them all and they mean a lot.

“Went to hospital and got my ear stitched back up so hopefully all will heal well. Thanks again for all the love and support. Have a good Christmas everyone.”

By Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal



The Harvey Weinstein sexual-harassment fire burns on, consuming famous men. Corporations and institutions are on automated rapid response: proclaim zero tolerance and throw offenders into the street, while directing human-resources departments to design fine-grained standards of acceptable behavior.

It would be a comfort to think that HR specialists could solve this problem, but what has gone wrong runs deeper than calling in the lawyers. A question persists: How did this happen?

How have so many intelligent, accomplished adult men crashed across the boundaries of sex? Psychiatric explanations—reducing cause to a uniquely individual neurosis—are insufficient. This isn’t just “really weird stuff.”

Some may have a distant memory of the culture wars of the 1990s. This looks like a moment to revisit some of its battlefields.

Incidents of sexual abuse on this scale don’t randomly erupt. They grow from the complex climate of a nation’s culture. These guys aren’t blips or outliers. These men are a product of their times.

What Obama never understood is that there is a close and important correlation between optimism and growth.
Most important, business leaders who view the future positively will invest in growth.","Poor President Obama. He doesn’t think he’s getting enough credit for today’s booming economy.

Speaking at a conference of mayors in Chicago recently, Mr. Obama said, “We saw the longest streak of job creation in American history by far — a streak that still continues, by the way.” After a dramatic pause, he added: “Thanks, Obama.”

Obama has always been excellent at making speeches. But delivering robust growth? Not so much. Certainly not the kind of 3 percent-plus growth the U.S. is enjoying today, which has forced unemployment to a 17-year low. Instead, we saw an extended period of tepid gains that did little to boost the spirits (or wages) of discouraged Americans.

President Obama will never understand what happened on Election Day, and why the country’s mood brightened.

But it’s important that our policymakers understand. Trump’s victory resulted in a sea change in expectations, setting off a benevolent chain reaction which continues to this day. That fact alone makes this undeniably Trump’s economy.

Here’s how we know:

Against all expectations, the stock market started to boom on November 9, 2016, the day after the election. The Dow soared 257 points, and gained 9 percent by year-end, for the biggest post-election rally ever. Why? Because investors believed that newly-elected President Trump was determined to create jobs, bring businesses back to the U.S., lower taxes and loosen the regulatory noose created by Obama. That’s what he campaigned on, and that’s why he was elected.

What Obama never understood is that there is a close and important correlation between optimism and growth. Optimistic consumers spend money. Optimistic investors buy stocks. Most important, business leaders who view the future positively will invest in growth.

The optimism unleashed on November 8, 2016, was astonishing. The very next month, consumer confidence soared to a 15-year high, according to the Conference Board, “well ahead of analysts' expectations.” To be precise, the index rose to 107.1 from 98.6; economic gurus were forecasting 101.5. It wasn’t the “current conditions” survey that popped, but rather the “future” outlook that jumped to the highest level since 2003.

The University of Michigan also saw their consumer confidence index leap. “The initial reaction of consumers to Trump's victory was to express greater optimism about their personal finances as well as improved prospects for the national economy,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, said at the time.

Gallup, too, in its polls, noted a jump in optimism post-election. They reported that the survey bumped into positive territory (most people think conditions are good) for the first time since early 2015.

Consumers were not alone. Small business owners were also cheered by Trump’s election. The National Federation of Independent Business reported an immediate surge in optimism among its members, with its confidence index rising to 105.8, its highest level since the end of 2004. The December gain was 7.4 points, the biggest monthly leap since 1980. The outlook from corporate CEOs, too, turned more positive. In fact, nearly every measure of manufacturing and business sentiment improved in the weeks following the election.

What Obama never understood is that there is a close and important correlation between optimism and growth. Optimistic consumers spend money. Optimistic investors buy stocks. Most important, business leaders who view the future positively will invest in growth.

Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in the weeks following the election that a pickup in business confidence normally boosts capital expenditures within a fairly short time frame, while rising consumer confidence can predict higher spending. That is, of course, exactly what happened.

Last year’s holiday spending was the highest in five years, up 4.8 percent after gains of 3.8 percent and 3.1 percent in the two prior years.

In early January, the NFIB’s chief economist Bill Dunkelberg wrote, “…we are also finding evidence that higher optimism is leading to increased business activity, such as capital investment.”

This is a simple concept, but only if you believe Mitt Romney’s assertion that “Corporations are people.”

Liberals trashed Romney for that remark, but he was right, of course. What he meant was that people are in charge of businesses, and responsible for the decisions they make. Cheery CEOs can do wonders for the country by hiring people and investing in new plants and equipment.

Democrats consider corporate America the enemy. Chuck Schumer derides the GOP tax plan as a handout to Big Business, as though the interests of that group are antithetical to those of working class Americans. Obama, sharing that sentiment, never reached out to the business community, never tried to understand and alleviate their concerns.

Trump is doing that.

Make no mistake: Trump needs to deliver on his campaign promises. It looks like the tax bill will pass, and that’s an important achievement. But we also need the infrastructure program he promised, as well as beefed-up job training, better public education, more favorable trade treaties, and we need to take a whack at out-of-control entitlements like Medicaid. And we need job gains to boost wages, which they inevitably will.

Obama left a long to-do list. He also left an economy that had disappointed millions of middle class Americans, who rewarded him by electing President Trump.","Obama still doesn’t get it – optimism, not whining, grows an economy",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/10/obama-still-doesn-t-get-it-optimism-not-whining-grows-economy.html

It’s that time of year again when universities across the country issue their guidelines to make their designated safe spaces as inclusive as possible during the Christmas season.

While “snowflakes” have been melting since President Trump’s election, there’s an avalanche of political correctness pushing for Christmas-free campuses, according to a senior at the University of California, Irvine.

“They’ll pander to the minority to the detriment of the majority,” she said.

At Rowlands’ campus, departments are encouraged to “focus on celebrating a special occasion, instead of a specific holiday” with a “year-end celebration” or “celebrating seasonal themes such as fall, winter, or spring.”

UCI’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity provided guidelines for “inclusive and sensitive” celebrations that requests “office celebrations are not indirectly celebrating religious holidays.” Instead they’re encouraged to “display diverse symbols representing a variety of faith traditions along with secular ones.”

The 23-year-old, who starred in nearly 290 movies, was found dead Tuesday morning in California. In mid-September, she appeared in a podcast where she detailed experiencing “a lot of sexual molestation” while growing up, adding that the offender was not her father, the Independent reported.

“It was just awful. It’s still recent where I have to keep myself occupied or else I start thinking about all that s—t and then I fall into a depression,” she said, citing the podcast. “I try to do therapy. I hate that word. I hate therapy.”

Ames said therapists would judge her after she revealed she worked in the adult industry. She then detailed her past drug abuse and how she used it to escape her issues.

“I don’t drink alcohol anymore. When I would drink, I’d black out every time. I used to smoke a lot of weed too, I used to be a big stoner but I’ve cut that out too. I just drink water now,” Ames said.

She added that she resorted to medication for her bipolar disorder, depression and multiple personality disorder. She recalled the “crippling” feeling when she wasn’t on medication.

Ames received major backlash in early December after she tweeted that she declined filming for a movie after she discovered the male actor also worked on gay pornography. She cited health safety reasons and insisted she was “not homophobic” and just wasn’t willing to put her “body at risk.”

“Whichever (lady) performer is replacing me tomorrow for @EroticaXNews , you’re shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn, just to let cha know. BS is all I can say…Do agents really not care about who they’re representing? #ladirect I do my homework for my body,” she tweeted.

Despite her insistence, several people accused her of being homophobic. Jaxton Wheeler, an adult film star, also took to Twitter to criticize Ames and said in a now-deleted tweet that Ames should “swallow a cyanide pill” for her comments. He posted the tweet after her death and soon apologized for his “out of context comment.” It's unclear if he knew about her death when the tweet was posted.

“My gay community friends please a life is lost and we gain nothing from anything but showing respect and sympathy, her fans and loved ones are upset, I'm sickened in my out of context comment. As I stated before anyone even made my tweet a thing,” Wheeler said.

“I have heard so much, especially in the last couple of weeks,” he said. “It is time, and I think we are going to see it tomorrow, that the majority of Alabama people put our decency, our state, before a political party. I think it’s time to say no more to treating people like second class citizens. It’s just time, folks, that we say no more.

Prior to Moore taking the microphone his wife, Kayla, addressed a series of accusations against the Senate candidate, including those that said Moore was anti-Jewish and anti-Black. The narrative, Kayla argued, was an inaccurate one perpetrated by the media.

“One of our attorneys is a Jew,” she said. “Fake news! They are the ones who are embarrassing and they should be ashamed for getting involved in this election for our opponent.”

When Moore finally reached the podium, he was largely subdued, discussing what he alleged was the country’s lost focus on God and the subsequent repercussions.

“We started to forget God and where our strength came from,” Moore said. “We have forgotten that faith upon which we are founded. My opposition has always been about my acknowledgment of God.”

Speaking about the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Moore admitted that the race “has been strange.”

“This race has been very odd,” Moore continued. “We’ve had two presidents, and one candidate for president, who didn’t make it, thank God, do robocalls in this state.

Technology and interior design are both crucial aspects of any media room. If your home doesn’t have a dedicated space solely for TV binges and movie nights, you’re not alone. Many households integrate the TV into a larger living room. It’s important that you design this space to ensure a fully functional and comfortable experience as you tune into nightly news and everyday entertainment. Here’s a rundown of some of the key features to consider.

Integrate surround sound technology. In order to take your media space to the next level and replicate a movie theater experience, you must first focus on the acoustics. Investing in surround sound will immerse you in the action on screen. Strategically place speakers around the room on nearby console tables or end tables and add a subwoofer if your budget allows.

Recessing speakers into your walls or ceiling will help them blend into the room and create an invisible, yet powerful effect. However, this can be expensive and hard to configure with existing drywall. A more manageable solution is to purchase a speaker system that matches your aesthetic and style. These electronics have come a long way since their classic black-box days and can be found in a range of colors and designs to fit into your room design perfectly.

Consider your lighting setup. Lighting and film have always been two sides of the same coin, so it’s no surprise that they’re equally important in media room setups. The right lighting is not only essential to set the ambience of a room, but also to make sure the screen is visible without glare. Professionals recommend LEDs, dimmers and recessed lights for an ideal setup. Contact a professional to get them installed in a glare-free way.

Natural light is welcomed in every room of the house, but you’ll want to keep glare in mind when positioning your TV in a room with windows. Blackout curtains might be helpful if there are limited locations for the TV.

Invest in sufficient media storage. With all the speakers and lights discussed above comes an issue of wires. Having eight speakers is great unless you’ll be tripping over and tangling up cords just to get to your seat. Recessed storage is an optimal solution, but it requires leading wires through walls. Thankfully, there are other ways to conceal wires and devices.

You can keep all your wired electronics hidden behind the door of a well-ventilated media cabinet or storage closet. This would be most useful if you have multiple accessories beyond a TV and speakers, such as a DVR, digital media player or video game console. Mounting the TV above a cabinet instead of placing it directly on top would also free up space and allow you to store supporting electronics on the top surface.

Lastly, commissioning a built-in media wall to fit all of your media components would give each of them an organized and structured home while creating storage space for movies, games and other decorations.

Plan out your furniture setup. This is the step that interior design comes to play in the most. Make sure that there is enough seating for everyone to sit and see the screen from their position. Sectional sofas are great for large audiences and you may even want to stock up on foldable chairs. Be sure to choose comfortable upholstery fabric since you’ll want something soft enough that you can sit through for hours during a movie marathon.

Consider placing a rug down on hardwood floors and switch out any wooden or hard plastic window blinds for fabric drapes. Avoiding hard surfaces is crucial to eliminating the “echo chamber” effect in many media spaces.

Lastly, pick the perfect coffee table for your space. It should be large enough to hold snacks, remote controls and even room for viewers to put their feet up if they wish to literally kick back and relax.",How to design a media room,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/16/how-to-design-media-room.html

By William McGurn, The Wall Street Journal



When Alabamans go to the polls a week from now in a special election to choose their next senator, not even Mrs. Roy Moore will be rooting as hard for her Republican husband as the junior senator from Minnesota, Al Franken.

The reason is simple. Mr. Franken knows that if Mr. Moore takes his Senate seat, it becomes less likely the former “Saturday Night Live” comic will have to relinquish his. And therein lies a larger tale about how the liberal opposition to Mr. Moore may be backfiring.

Until this race, plausible accusations that a candidate had engaged in sexual conduct with girls as young as 14 would be enough to sink most any man. Coming as these charges do amid a national sexual reckoning that has already brought down many powerful men hitherto thought untouchable, they ought to be even more potent.

But Mr. Moore is not sinking. To the contrary, at last check the Real Clear Politics polling average gives him a 2.6-point lead. A CBS News poll released this past weekend has him up by 6 points.

If Mr. Moore does win, it will be despite calls by Republicans and conservatives for him to step aside. The calls have come from Republican leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, among others.

Then again, the remaining GOP support, including that of Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and now President Donald Trump, may carry more pull. Mr. Moore further benefits from the backing of the evangelical community, many of whose pastors have stuck with him.

But there’s another potent force in this race, which gets little media attention. These are the liberals who are enabling him. Let’s run through a short list:

• Bill Clinton . Remember the argument “It was only sex”? Or reporter Nina Burleigh saying she’d be happy to give then-President Clinton oral sex “just to thank him for keeping abortion legal”?

Some who backed Mr. Clinton now recognize that their unqualified support through all his lies and bad behavior leaves them in a poor position to lecture others about how to treat women, or why policy should not trump character. Now they are throwing Mr. Clinton under the bus to try to regain the moral high ground. How persuasive must Alabamans find this?

• Doug Jones. He is the Democrat in the race. When your rival is credibly accused of sexual misbehavior with underage girls, the race is yours to lose. And yet Mr. Jones is doing his best to do just that, over a classic Democratic blind spot: abortion.

Alabama is one of America’s most pro-life states. Mr. Jones might have expanded his appeal by opting for the Bill Clinton formula of “safe, legal and rare,” or supporting popular restrictions such as the ban after 20 weeks. Instead, Mr. Jones has opted for the Hillary Clinton view that abortion must be sacrosanct. If he ends up losing, abortion will be a big reason.

• Al Franken. On the hypocrisy front there’s plenty on all sides to go around. Still, it has to be hard for Alabama Republicans not to notice that they are being called on to reject their guy at a time when Democrats are keeping theirs.

• Jimmy Kimmel. Mr. Kimmel recently dispatched a comedian to heckle Mr. Moore at a rally at the Magnolia Springs Baptist Church. He succeeded in disrupting the event. Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Moore then got into a Twitter tiff after Mr. Moore suggested Mr. Kimmel put up his dukes, and Mr. Kimmel accepted.

Mr. Kimmel and his audience have had some good yucks at the expense of the local yokels. But again, just a guess that this may not be playing as well in Alabama.",Roy Moore's Liberal Enablers,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/05/roy-moores-liberal-enablers

The Trump administration turned to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying the Pentagon still will be reviewing the policy until February but needs the emergency stay now.

“Without this relief, the military will be forced to implement a significant change to its standards for the composition of the armed forces before it decides how to resolve this issue,” the government’s motion stated. “As military leadership has explained, this timetable will place extraordinary burdens on our armed forces and may harm military readiness.”

The president over the summer announced, via Twitter, a ban on transgender service members. But the directive has been challenged since in the courts, and a federal judge last month said the U.S. military must accept them starting Jan. 1.

The new policy reflects growing legal pressure on the issue and the difficult hurdles the federal government would have to cross to enforce Trump’s demand.

Fox News previously reported that potential transgender recruits still will have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that make it possible, though difficult, for them to join the armed services.

Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, says the enlistment of transgender recruits will start Jan. 1 and go on amid the legal battles. The Defense Department also is studying the issue.

Eastburn told The Associated Press on Monday that the new guidelines mean the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. But such recruits are allowed in if a medical provider certifies they’ve been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy also must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror concerns President Barack Obama’s administration laid out when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender service last year.

“Due to the complexity of this new medical standard, trained medical officers will perform a medical prescreen of transgender applicants for military service who otherwise meet all applicable applicant standards,” Eastburn said.

Aaron Belkin, director of the California-based Palm Center, an independent institute that has conducted research on sexual minorities in the military, said the 18-month timeline is fair.

“It’s a good standard because the Pentagon is treating gender dysphoria according to the same standards that are applied to all medical conditions,” he said.

However, Elaine Donnelly, president for the Center For Military Readiness, said Trump “has every right to review, revise, or repeal his predecessor’s military transgender policies, which would detract from mission readiness and combat lethality.” Court judges, she said, are not qualified to run the military.

Al Franken has promised under pressure to step down from the U.S. Senate “in the coming weeks.” He was not accused of such grave crimes as rape or preying on underage children. He was accused instead of grabbing, fondling, lunging at and humiliating seven women. If true, and I think we see a pattern here, this would make him a pig, a bully and a hypocrite. His departure, while personally sad, is no loss to American democracy.

It was not mad Puritanism that chased him from office; it was his colleagues’ finally, belatedly announcing and establishing standards of behavior. This is not an unreasonable or unhelpful thing to do.

Journalists and political figures of my generation have been wryly remembering what we had to put up with in the old days—how a woman couldn’t get on an elevator with Sen. Strom Thurmond without being pinched or patted. All true. But even Thurmond would not have survived a photo of him leering over a sleeping woman and posing—deliberately, perhaps sadistically, so the moment could be memorialized—as he grabbed or simulated grabbing her breasts, which is what Mr. Franken did. The Franken case represents not a collapse of tolerance for flawed human behavior but a rise of judgment about what is acceptable.

People speak of mixed motives and say it’s all brute politics. The Democrats are positioning themselves for the high ground should Republican Roy Moore be elected. They’re aligning themselves with the passions of their base, while clearing the way for a probe into sexual-harassment accusations against the president. New York’s Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who led the charge that forced Mr. Franken’s departure, hopes to run for president in 2020 as a champion of women, so the move was happily on-brand.

This is a tale of FBI power misused and presidential trust misplaced.

Last week, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s confidant on matters pertaining to national security from June 2015 to February 2017 and his short-lived national security adviser in the White House, pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington, D.C., to a single count of lying to the FBI. Under the terms of his plea agreement, Flynn, who had faced nearly 60 years in federal prison had he been convicted of charges related to all the matters about which there is said to be credible evidence of his guilt, will now face six months.

What could have caused Robert Mueller, the no-nonsense special counsel investigating whether any Americans aided the Russian government in its now well-known interference in the 2016 American presidential election, to have given Flynn such an extraordinary deal?

Here is the back story.

During the FBI’s investigation of Russian meddling in the election, it became interested in Flynn’s communications with Sergey Kislyak, a KGB colonel (the KGB is now known by its post-Soviet acronym, FSB) masquerading as the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

After Trump won the presidency, Flynn became an important member of the presidential transition team. Between the election and the inauguration, Flynn spoke on the telephone with Kislyak five times. Because Kislyak was a foreign spy, as well as an ambassador, his communications with Americans were monitored by the FBI.

When Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI in his West Wing office on Jan. 24, he probably did not know what the agents were looking for. Jim Comey was still the director of the FBI. Mueller had not yet been named special counsel.

The vigil included candles which spelled out the name Kate, flowers, and an easel which held aloft a poster of Steinle’s smiling face.

“The burden of tragedy no longer solely rests on the shoulders of her family, but on the shoulders every American,” Naweed Tahmas, external vice president of the Berkeley College Republicans, said during the event.","At UC Berkeley, Vandals Trash Vigil Poster Honoring Kate Steinle",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/11/uc-berkeley-vandals-trash-vigil-poster-honoring-kate-steinle

The new policy reflects the difficult hurdles the federal government would have to cross to enforce Trump's demand earlier this year to bar transgender individuals from the military.

Three federal courts have ruled against the ban, including one Monday in Washington state.

In October, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly barred the Trump administration from proceeding with its plan to exclude transgender people from military service. Part of the effect of the ruling was that the military would be required to allow transgender people to enlist beginning Jan. 1.

The government had asked Kollar-Kotelly to put the Jan. 1 date on hold while they appealed her full ruling but she declined Monday, reaffirming the Jan. 1 start date. The Department of Justice is now asking a federal appeals court to intervene and put the Jan. 1 requirement on hold.

Potential transgender recruits will have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that could make it difficult for them to join the armed services.

Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the enlistment of transgender recruits will begin next month and proceed amid legal battles. The Defense Department also is doing a review, which is expected to carry into 2018.

Eastburn told The Associated Press on Monday that the new guidelines mean the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. But such recruits are allowed in if a medical provider certifies they've been clinically stable in their preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror concerns President Barack Obama's administration laid out when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender service last year.

""Due to the complexity of this new medical standard, trained medical officers will perform a medical prescreen of transgender applicants for military service who otherwise meet all applicable applicant standards,"" Eastburn said.

Aaron Belkin, director of the California-based Palm Center, an independent institute that has conducted research on sexual minorities in the military, said the 18-month timeline is fair.

""It's a good standard because the Pentagon is treating gender dysphoria according to the same standards that are applied to all medical conditions,"" he said.

However, Elaine Donnelly, president for the Center For Military readiness, said Trump ""has every right to review, revise, or repeal his predecessor's military transgender policies, which would detract from mission readiness and combat lethality."" Court judges, she said, are not qualified to run the military.

The Pentagon move Monday signals the growing sense within the government that authorities are likely to lose the legal fight.

""The controversy will not be about whether you allow transgender enlistees, it's going to be on what terms,"" said Brad Carson, who was deeply involved in the last administration's decisions. ""That's really where the controversy will lie.""

Carson worried, however, that the Defense Department could opt to comply with a deadline on allowing transgender recruits, but ""under such onerous terms that practically there will be none."" Carson, who worked for Carter as the acting undersecretary of defense for personnel, said requiring 18 months of stability in the preferred sex is a reasonable time.

""It doesn't have any basis in science,"" he said, noting that experts have suggested six months is enough. ""But as a compromise among competing interests and perhaps to err on the side of caution, 18 months was what people came around to. And that's a reasonable position and defensible.""

Sarah McBride, spokeswoman for Human Rights Campaign, praised the court's ruling, saying that it affirms ""there is simply no legitimate reason to forbid willing and able transgender Americans from serving their country.""

It was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
“Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,” according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.
In January, McCain officially gave the dossier to the FBI, which already had its own copy from Steele.
Fusion GPS and Kramer did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.","The man who says he acted as a “go-between” last year to inform Sen. John McCain about the controversial “dossier” containing salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump is speaking out, revealing how the ex-British spy who researched the document helped coordinate its release to the FBI, the media and Capitol Hill.

“My mission was essentially to be a go-between and a messenger, to tell the senator and assistants that such a dossier existed,” Sir Andrew Wood told Fox News in an exclusive interview with senior executive producer Pamela K. Browne.

Fox News spoke to Wood at the 2017 Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada. As Britain’s ambassador to Moscow from 1995-2000, Wood witnessed the end of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the rise of Vladimir Putin.

Just after the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, Arizona GOP Sen. McCain spoke at the same security conference. Wood says he was instructed — by former British spy Christopher Steele — to reach out to the senior Republican, whom Wood called “a good man,” about the unverified document.

Wood insists that he’s never read the dossier that his good friend and longtime colleague prepared. It was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

In August 2016, “[Steele] came to me to tell me what was in it, and why it … was important,” Wood said. “He made it very clear … yes, it was raw intelligence, but it needed putting into proper context before you could judge it fully.”

August 2016 is a critical period, just after the FBI opened the Russia meddling probe, and after then-director James Comey recommended against prosecution for Clinton’s mishandling of classified information.

Wood said Steele had “already been in contact with the FBI” at the time.

“He said there was corroborating evidence in the United States, from which I assumed he was working with an American company,” Wood said.

British court records reviewed by Fox News as well as U.S. congressional testimony revealed that Steele was directed and paid at least $168,000 by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson to push the research that fall to five American media outlets. According to British court documents, Steele met with The New York Times (twice), The Washington Post (twice), CNN, The New Yorker and Yahoo News (twice).

“Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,” according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.

Wood said he’d heard of Fusion GPS, as the group Steele was working with, but had “never heard of Mr. Simpson.”

Three weeks after Trump won the presidential election, at the Canadian security conference, the details were finalized for the dossier hand-off to McCain.

Along with the senator, Wood and McCain Institute for International Leadership staffer David J. Kramer attended the Canadian conference.

British court records state McCain ordered Kramer to get a personal briefing from Steele in Surrey, just outside of London, and then return to Washington, D.C., where Fusion GPS would provide McCain with hard copies.

In January, McCain officially gave the dossier to the FBI, which already had its own copy from Steele.

Of note, listed in the official program for the 2016 November Canadian conference as a participant was Rinat Akhmetshin — the same Russian lobbyist who was at Trump Tower five months earlier in June for a highly scrutinized meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and others.

The senator’s office noted to Fox News that McCain said in January 2017 he had no contact with Akhmetshin. “Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.”

It is not known whether Akhmetshin had any contact with Kramer. Fusion GPS and Kramer did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.

The third time Ji Hyeon-A got caught and sent back to North Korea she was three months pregnant.
Ji-Hyeon-A urged the U.N. and world leaders to fight for North Korean defectors and especially those who are repatriated.
At the Security Council meeting, Haley said the full story of the North Korean people needed to be told.
“The North Korean regime's system of guilt-by-association,” she said, “allows for up to three generations of family members to be imprisoned along with the accused.”","United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley held a meeting on the human rights situation in North Korea where one defector spoke about how she was forced to have an abortion following her repatriation from China.

The woman, Ji Hyeon-A, describes a harrowing scene of prison dogs eating dead bodies at her prison camp. She pleaded for the world to act.

The event was titled “The Terrifying experience of forcibly Repatriated North Korean women,” and was sponsored by the U.S. France, Japan, South Korea, Canada and the U.K.

Ji Hyeon-A was repatriated three times to North Korea after she was caught in China. She finally escaped to South Korea and spoke of her horrifying experiences.

She described how North Korean women who got pregnant in China were forced to have abortions.

“Pregnant women were forced into harsh labor all day,” she said. “At night, we heard pregnant mothers screaming and babies died without ever being able to see their mothers.”

North Korea does not allow for mixed-race babies, she said. At one detention center, she described how inmates starved to death. Their dead bodies, she said, were given to the guard dogs for food.

The third time Ji Hyeon-A got caught and sent back to North Korea she was three months pregnant. She tearfully described how she was forced to have an abortion without medication at a local police station.

“My first child passed away without ever seeing the world,” she said, “without any time for me to apologize.”

She finally reached South Korea in 2007 and has since been reunited with her mother, brother and her younger sister. She still has not heard news of her father.

Ji-Hyeon-A said that the North Korean soldier who recently escaped to South Korea “represents a dash toward freedom which is a dream of 25 million North Koreans.”

She said North Korea was “a terrifying prison and the Kim’s are carrying out a vast massacre and it takes a miracle to survive there.”

She criticized the Chinese government for sending North Koreans back to the regime, and urged the Chinese government to stop repatriating people back to the Hermit Kingdom, saying they know what will happen to them when they get there.

Ji-Hyeon-A urged the U.N. and world leaders to fight for North Korean defectors and especially those who are repatriated.

She recited a poem called “Is anyone there?” from a collection of poems she wrote.

“I am scared, is anyone there? I’m here in hell, is anyone there? I scream and yell but no one opens the door. Is anyone there? Please listen to our moans and listen to our pain. Is anyone there? People are dying, my friend is dying. I call out again and again but why don’t you answer. Is anyone there?

Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations, Matthew Rycroft, praised Ji-Hyeon-A for speaking at the event, and said the crimes discussed, which included, “forced abortions, summary executions, hard labor, rape: those are conditions that amount to crimes against humanity,” he said.

Earlier in the day China had tried to stop a Security Council meeting convened by Japan on the human rights situation in North Korea. China only had the support of Russia and Bolivia and failed in its attempt to stop it from moving forward.

At the Security Council meeting, Haley said the full story of the North Korean people needed to be told.

“The regime is using that power to develop an unnecessary arsenal and support enormous conventional military forces that pose a grave risk to international peace and security,” she said. “Their menacing march towards nuclear weapons begins with the oppression and exploitation of ordinary North Korean people.”

Haley said the situation was made possible “through the export of workers abroad to earn hard currency and the use of forced labor at home, the regime uses its people to underwrite its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.”

She said the Kim regime has imprisoned an estimated 100,000 people.

Islamist extremists are clearly answering the call of Sheik Adnani to kill Westerners using whatever means necessary wherever they are. Since our enemies our constantly adjusting their tactics, we must remain agile in defense of our nation.

To defeat these threats, we need to work with tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to take down radical propaganda that preaches hate and recruits new members to the terrorist cause. The advancement of technology has brought great benefits, but is has also been a powerful tool for our adversaries. The internet been a constant lifeline, allowing them to effectively plot and communicate at lightning speed.

We must also bolster the security of our airports with the most advanced screening technology available. Even though many of the attacks in the last year have been vehicular homicides, our aviation sector is still the “crown jewel” of targets.

Lastly, the U.S. must continue to lead an international alliance dedicated to using all of its economic, intelligence, military, and other resources to dry up funding for terrorists and destroy them on the battlefield.

As Americans, we cannot forget that we are in this fight together. Terrorists do not check our political affiliations before they carry out an attack. We will have political differences on many issues, but our commitment to keeping our homeland safe and secure should be a national priority for everyone.

Lizza emerged as a household name last summer after he recorded a phone call with then-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who went off on a profanity-laced tirade. President Trump fired Scaramucci after less than two weeks.

“The New Yorker recently learned that Ryan Lizza engaged in what we believe was improper sexual conduct. We have reviewed the matter and, as a result, have severed ties with Lizza. Due to a request for privacy, we are not commenting further,” the magazine said in a statement.

Lizza is also a contributor to CNN and the network put out its own statement shortly after the news broke.

“We have just learned of the New Yorker's decision. Ryan Lizza will not appear on CNN while we look into this matter,” a CNN spokesperson said.

“I am dismayed that The New Yorker has decided to characterize a respectful relationship with a woman I dated as somehow inappropriate,” Lizza said in a statement to the media. “I am sorry to my friends, workplace colleagues, and loved ones for any embarrassment this episode may cause. I love The New Yorker... But this decision, which was made hastily and without a full investigation of the relevant facts, was a terrible mistake.”

“In no way did Mr. Lizza's misconduct constitute a 'respectful relationship' as he has now tried to characterize it,” the unnamed accuser's attorney, Douglas Wigdor, told a Washington Post reporter.

Lizza has not appeared on CNN since November 22, according to the Daily Beast. Perhaps his absence from the network is a result of appearing in the “Sh-tty Media Men” list, which has floated around the industry for several weeks. The list is filled with powerful men in the media industry who are accused anonymously of misconduct, including sexual harassment and assault.

CNN did not respond to a request for comment about whether the network would investigate Lizza or rely on The New Yorker. CNN also did not respond when asked if Lizza’s recent absence is a result of being included on the “Sh-tty Media Men” list.

Scaramucci’s political career essentially ended after he didn’t seem to realize his profane conversation with Lizza was on the record. The Hill media columnist Joe Concha pondered whether Scaramucci knew about Lizza’s alleged misconduct, pointing to comments made in a Dec. 4 interview.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board

Christopher Wray was supposed to bring a new candor and credibility to the FBI after the James Comey debacle, but the country is still waiting. The director’s testimony Thursday to the House Judiciary Committee suggests he has joined the Justice Department effort to stop the public from learning about the bureau’s role in the 2016 election.

Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte invited Mr. Wray to answer the multiplying questions about the bureau’s 2016 political interference. This includes the role that the Steele dossier—opposition research financed by the Clinton campaign—played in the FBI’s decision to investigate the Trump presidential campaign. The committee also wants answers about reports that special counsel Robert Mueller demoted Peter Strzok, a lead FBI investigator in both the Trump and Hillary Clinton email investigations, after Mr. Strzok exchanged anti-Trump texts with his mistress, who also works at the FBI.

Mr. Wray spent five hours stonewalling. The director ducked every question about the FBI’s behavior by noting that the Justice Department Inspector General is investigating last year’s events.

Is Mr. Wray concerned that Mr. Strzok edited the FBI’s judgment of Mrs. Clinton’s handling of her emails to “extremely careless” from “grossly negligent” in a previous draft? The grossly negligent phrase might have put Mrs. Clinton in legal jeopardy, but Mr. Wray said he couldn’t answer because that is subject to the “outside, independent investigation.”

Is Mr. Wray taking steps to ensure his top ranks are free of political “taint”? He couldn’t say because of the “outside, independent” investigation.

Ohio Republican Jim Jordan noted that the only way for Congress to know if the FBI used the Steele dossier to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign is for the FBI to provide its application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. “Is there anything prohibiting you from showing this committee [that application]?” Mr. Jordan asked.

Mr. Wray’s answer was dismissive. “I do not believe that I can legally and appropriately share a FISA court submission with this committee,” said Mr. Wray. “When I sign FISA applications, which I have to do almost every day of the week, they are all covered with a ‘classified information’ cover.”",Christopher Wray's FBI Stonewall,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/11/christopher-wrays-fbi-stonewall#commenting

How is it possible that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal indictment for mishandling classified documents despite incriminating evidence that she violated the Espionage Act?

Why did Donald Trump become the target of a criminal investigation for allegedly conspiring with Russia to influence the presidential election despite no evidence that he ever did so?

The answer, it seems, comes down to one person who played a vital role in both cases: Peter Strzok, deputy director of counterintelligence at the FBI.

Strzok was exchanging politically charged texts with an FBI lawyer that denigrated Trump and lauded Clinton at the same time he was leading the bureau’s criminal investigation of Clinton. He is also the one who changed the critical wording of then-FBI Director James Comey’s description of Clinton’s handling of classified material that resulted in no charges being brought against her.

Then, Strzok reportedly signed the document launching the 2016 investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether the Trump campaign played any role. After leading the FBI’s probe into Trump, he then joined Robert Mueller’s special counsel team as an integral investigator.

Thus, it appears that one man with a strident political agenda accomplished his twin goals of clearing Clinton and accusing Trump, evidence be damned.

And then he was caught.

The Strzok Bust and Cover-up

The Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, discovered the electronic texts Strzok exchanged with his lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. The messages were so politically incendiary and so threatened the integrity of Mueller’s investigation that Strzok was quietly canned over the summer from the special counsel team, where he was a pivotal participant.","Gregg Jarrett: How an FBI Official with a Political Agenda Corrupted Both Mueller, Comey Investigations",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/06/gregg-jarrett-how-fbi-official-political-agenda-corrupted-both-mueller-comey

Charli Stevens was shopping in the morning for Christmas wrapping supplies at a grocery store with her 5-month-old son when she was approached by a random woman.

“I notice this woman, who was probably in her 50s, kept staring at me,” Stevens writes on her Facebook of the encounter. “A couple minutes later, she came up to me and said ‘I think your clothes are a little too small on you’.”

The horrified mother of two said she was caught so off guard that all she could muster was, “Excuse me?”

The body shamer doubled down on her statements, saying, “Well no offense but you’re just a bit big to wear those type (sic) of clothes,” Stevens wrote on her Facebook.

Stevens, who had recently lost 50 pounds, says she instantly started to cry from the rude woman’s words.

“Usually I’m so quick to lash out at rude people and I’m never shy when it comes down to speaking my mind. But I froze. Froze and cried,” Stevens writes.

Even after Stevens started crying, the woman continued with, “I’m not trying to be mean but maybe just reconsider your outfit before leaving your house from now on,” Stevens wrote.

After the woman left, Stevens says she gathered up her son and left without buying anything.

But now the humiliated mom is defending herself – and calling for others to think before they speak.

“It’s no secret that I’ve gained weight throughout life. I’ve birthed two kids so it’s bound to happen. Do I realize I’m overweight? Yes. Do I want to be smaller? Yes. But am I okay with the way I look? Yes!!” Stevens writes.

“Please, PLEASE, have some respect for people. You never know what someone is going through or if your one little comment, snicker, stare, whatever will be enough to break someone down or push them over the edge,” she added.

Though she is unsure what would prompt a complete stranger would go out of their way to insult someone else, Stevens is asking for others to think about their actions and be more considerate.

At 8:45 a.m. ET a law enforcement official told reporters, including the Associated Press, that a man had a pipe bomb strapped to him when it went off on a New York City subway platform. That was roughly the same time that CNN was in the middle of a segment that featured the chyron, “NYT Report: Trump drinks a dozen diet cokes per day,” while a large graphic promoting Tuesday’s Election Night in Alabama took up a significant portion of the screen.

Viewers quickly took notice. Media crisis guru Yossi Gestetner tweeted, “More than an hour after the pipe-bomb story broke, CNN was busy with Trump’s diet Coke,” while another viewer asked, “Why are you talking about this!”

“Astonishing how quickly CNN pivoted from NYC explosion to ridiculous story Trump drinking a lot of Diet Coke,” Newsbusters Senior Editor Rich Noyes tweeted.

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor used the situation to mock CNN’s recent ad campaign in which the network uses an apple in an attempt to combat its “fake news” reputation.

“U.S. News was talking about the bombing at 7:54. Nearly an hour later, CNN is whining about Donald Trump drinks Diet Cokes and watches too much TV instead of reporting about terrorism in New York City,” Gainor told Fox News. “CNN might tell you what it's giving you is an apple, but if it is, it's rotten.”

The suspected bomber was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah and police have called the incident an ""attempted terrorist attack."" An ""effectively low tech device"" was detonated in a subway passageway just before 7:30 a.m., New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference.

While viewers scrambled to hear the latest news, several people took to Twitter to mock CNN’s programming’s decision. Blogger Ann Althouse noted that the New York Times article that first mentioned Trump’s soda habit came out a few days ago and added, “CNN is hopeless,” after expressing frustration that CNN didn’t offer the live report on the attempted terror attack.

The explosion reportedly occurred around 7:30 a.m. near 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, NYPD and FDNY officials confirmed to Fox News. An NYPD source on the scene told Fox News a device went off, and there was a bomb strapped to a person.

2018 is going to be one rough ride.

President Trump’s supporters are intensifying their attacks on the Justice Department investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Anyone listening only to right-wing talk radio and television would assume Special Counsel Robert Mueller is “corrupt” (that’s according to Newt Gingrich); the leader of a “silent coup” (according to Rush Limbaugh); and a bad guy whose “credibility is in the gutter” (according to Sean Hannity). The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page has already said Mueller should “step down.”

The president is personally rallying his troops to help derail the investigation by throwing dirt at the FBI. On Twitter, he has said the FBI’s reputation is in “tatters” and “the worst in history.”

These baseless, partisan assaults on law enforcement are just a slice of the biggest unresolved problem in American politics — the power of propaganda.

Google, Facebook and Twitter have to be held to account for the enormous platforms they give to propaganda that is tearing down the country.

Trust in American democracy as a “shining city upon a hill” for all freedom loving people, to quote President Reagan, is being unraveled by partisan echo chambers and internet-based propaganda.

The result is an endless airing of conspiracy theories and the equally relentless stoking of grievances against political foes.

America’s enemies know we have a problem.

In October, Facebook turned over to congressional investigators more than 3,000 advertisements placed by Russian sites during the 2016 presidential campaign. The company said 10 million people viewed those advertisements.

Twitter found 200 accounts tied to Facebook pages under Russian control. Google reported the Internet Research Agency, a company with ties to the Kremlin, put 1,000 videos on YouTube.

The New York Times reported in October that the “disinformation campaign spread well beyond Facebook to sites like Reddit, Instagram, 4chan and Imgur…making it more difficult to curb the tide of fake accounts.”

The goal of the Russian social media assault was to disrupt American democracy by splitting the country into warring camps, divided on hot button issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, gun ownership, gay rights and immigration.

The Russians also promoted candidate Donald Trump.

Russia’s version of Facebook even offered to help the Trump campaign, according to a report last week in The Washington Post, by offering to “promote Trump’s campaign to its nearly 100 million users.”

In October, executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter were grilled by a Senate subcommittee on their underwhelming response to Russia’s success in manipulating American public opinion.

“The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter’s acting general counsel said, asking for patience.

“It’s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) who chaired the hearing, told the New York Times. “What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.”

A bipartisan group of senators led by Republican John McCain (Ariz.) and Democrats Mark Warner (Va.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) has introduced legislation, the Honest Ads Act, to do just that: require the companies to publicly disclose who is paying for political advertisements online.

It’s unclear when, or whether, congressional leaders will advance the bill.

But Google, Facebook and Twitter have to be held to account for the enormous platforms they give to propaganda that is tearing down the country.

Yet not everyone agrees. A November Axios poll conducted by Survey Monkey found that 62 percent of American adults do not want the government to regulate social media companies like other media companies. Just 34 percent do. According to the poll, a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents say they want government to stay out of it.

In that case, what is to stop Russia and other bad actors from continuing to screw with American elections?

“Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google have grown to encompass duties to the public trust — duties that these companies were never intended to handle in the first place,” Jim Geraghty wrote in the conservative National Review last week.

Before the 2016 election, little thought was given to how “empowering everyone to send short messages, post videos or create online communities meant it would empower terrorists, criminals, hate groups, garden-variety nut-jobs and child predators to do the same things,” he wrote.

And what about Russia and other foreign powers out to cripple American democracy?

“Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google realize that whether or not they intended to be media companies or want to be media companies, they have become media companies, and they need to take responsibility for what appears on their platforms,” he argued.

Geraghty is right. Now is the time to revive the doctrine of corporate social responsibility as hostile foreign powers are no doubt plotting to again use social media to disrupt next year’s election.

Ira Dube, a Navy veteran living in Colorado, told Fox News he’s been searching for the families of veterans who served with his late father, Sgt. Stanley Dube, in what he said was the 27th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army National Guard, 108th Infantry Regiment, in the 1940s.

Dube believes the portraits are of men who served in the 105th Infantry Regiment.

His search began in January 2017, after he found the portraits — of 17 different servicemen — in his sister’s attic.

The artwork, Dube said, is a way for the descendants of these American veterans to be able to “see how my dad saw their hero through his eyes.”

Three of the 17 drawings had identifying information on them — signatures of the men drawn.

He took the minimal information that he had to the internet, and, “totally out of the blue,” he discovered relatives of Joseph “Joner” Kratky — a soldier who was killed in action in June of 1944 in Saipan — who were “amazed” at the drawing.

Dube was also able to connect with the family of Joe “Solid Jackson” Orbe.

When he sent Orbe’s family the artwork, he included a note to the late soldier’s young granddaughter, saying: “Know your grandfather was a hero during a very difficult time in our country,” according to WPIX.

A third portrait, Dube said, had the last name ""Reid"" written on it. He was unable to read the first name.

“I keep going on to the sites, looking at pictures, trying to match sketches to those pictures,” Dube told Fox 21.

Dube told Fox News he believes the men in the drawings “were closer” to his father “as friends than maybe as comrades,” and thinks many of them are from New York or New Jersey.

He added that his father, while he didn’t speak much about his time in the war — “I don’t think anybody really did when they came back” — was always drawing or painting.

Throughout his many moves in life, whether it was to a new house or to a retirement community, Dube said it was “just amazing that my dad had kept them as many times as he moved during the decades.”

“They had to have a meaning in them,” he added of the artwork. Dube said Stanley continued to work on his art — even after suffering strokes — until his 80s. He passed away at 90 years old in 2009.

Dube has sent the artwork to the New York State Military Museum, which is eager to help find the family members of those pictured, he said.

“I want to return these sketches to these families,” Dube told PIX. “I’m sending the love he put into it.”

Those with information on the artwork can contact Ira Dube on Facebook or contact Jim Gandy, of the New York State Military Museum’s research center, at 518-581-5109.

Akayed Ullah, 27, set off the “effectively low-tech device” in a subway passageway just before 7:30 a.m., New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference. Ullah, who lived in Brooklyn, suffered burns and wounds to his abdomen and hands, and appeared to be the only person seriously injured in the pipe bomb explosion, authorities said.

At least four other people suffered minor injuries, including ringing in the ears and headaches. Three have been released from the hospital, officials told Fox News.

The bomb was ignited with a Christmas light, matches and a nine-volt battery, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. They said the short pipe was packed with explosive powder but didn't work as intended, and the blast wasn't powerful enough to turn the pipe into deadly shrapnel.

Ullah claimed he blew up his explosive device because he noticed a holiday picture in the hallway and was inspired by ISIS-style Christmas threats, two law enforcement officials told WNBC.

“This is New York, the reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom,” Cuomo said.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the explosion “was an attempted terrorist attack,” adding there was no additional known threat to New York City. Authorities are viewing transit system video that captured the incident.

“Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve his ultimate goals,” de Blasio said.

Ullah’s attack was inspired by ISIS, but he had no direct contact with the terrorist group, law enforcement officials told the AP. When asked if Ullah made statements about ISIS, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said the suspect did make statements, but he did not go into detail about what was said.

Department of Homeland Security Press Secretary Tyler Houlton said in a statement that Ullah entered the U.S. in 2011 from Bangladesh on a chain migration visa. He had used a “passport displaying an F43 family immigrant visa in 2011.” He added the suspect “is a lawful permanent resident.”

Ullah strapped the crude pipe bomb to his body with Velcro and zip ties. The suspect allegedly packed the 5-inch metal pipe bomb and battery pack into the right side of his jacket, but the device exploded earlier than intended, law enforcement sources told The New York Post. The suspect said he made the bomb at his workplace, law enforcement sources told Fox News. He reportedly worked at an electrical company.

Cuomo told NY1 that officials “have reason to believe that [Ullah] went to the Internet and found out how to make a homemade bomb.” Law enforcement sources told Fox News that Ullah had “extensive overseas travel,” though there are no known coconspirators.

A large police presence was spotted soon after the explosion in a section of Brooklyn that boasts a significant Bangladeshi population.

According to WABC, the suspect's family released a strongly worded statement saying, “We are heartbroken by the violence that was targeted at our city today, and by the allegations being made against a member of our family. But we are also outraged by the behavior of law enforcement officials who have held children as small as four years old out in the cold and who held a teenager out of high school classes to interrogate him without a lawyer, without his parents. These are not the sorts of actions that we expect from our justice system, and we have every confidence that our justice system will find the truth behind this attack and that we will, in the end, be able to learn what occurred today. Thank you for your time.”

An NYPD source on the scene at Port Authority told Fox News a device went off, and there was a bomb strapped to a person. The Port Authority Police Benevolent Association said its officers — identified as Jack Collins, Sean Gallagher, Drew Preston and Anthony Manferdini — took down the suspect at gunpoint.

President Donald Trump in a statement blamed the country’s “lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country.”

“Today’s terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security,” the statement read. “My Executive action to restrict the entry of certain nationals from eight countries, which the Supreme Court recently allowed to take effect, is just one step forward in securing our immigration system. Congress must end chain migration.”

“The terrible harm that this flawed system inflicts on America’s security and economy has long been clear. I am determined to improve our immigration system to put our country and our people first,” the statement continued.

Monday’s explosion is the second ISIS-inspired attack in New York City in less than two months. An Oct. 31 terror attack killed eight people and injured 11 others after a man drove a rented truck into people walking and cycling on a bike path in Lower Manhattan.

Several people wrote on social media shortly after reports of Monday’s explosion that there was mass chaos at the bus terminal, some saying there was a “stampede” when the blast was heard.

A Greyhound bus driver told Fox News he heard a loud noise and soon was ordered by authorities to leave.

“I don’t argue with the guns,” the man said.

John, 25, was on his way to work when he heard about the explosion: “It’s sad to say but it’s just another day [here].”

“It’s crazy. It’s chaos right now,” said Lisa, 53, who was visiting New York City from Columbus, Ohio. “You do hear about it or see it, but I wasn’t expecting to see this on my run for Starbucks.”

Port Authority is the largest bus terminal in the U.S., and about 232,000 commuters go through the area daily. The number of passengers is expected to jump to 337,000 daily by 2040.

The terminal reopened Monday morning after it was temporarily closed. Several subway lines were halted and redirected to bypass Times Square and Port Authority after the incident.

The liquid-fueled rocket that North Korea launched into space recently lacked precision guidance, as well as a viable warhead.","Listen to the mainstream media and President Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and you would conclude that war on the Korean Peninsula is imminent, right?

You’d be wrong. The only way a war breaks out in Northeast Asia is if Washington starts it. Let me tell you why.

The 50-year war between North Korea and its neighbor South Korea is over. North Korea lost. Dictator Kim Jong Un now presides over a dying society in the North – a prison camp full of about 25 million miserable, starving people masquerading as a country. North Korea lags in economic terms somewhere behind Ethiopia.

In contrast, South Korea is an economic juggernaut; a nation of roughly 51 million with an economy larger than that of Russia, which has a population of about 144 million. In terms of per capita gross domestic product, South Korea ranks 31st in the world, while Russia ranks 68th and North Korea ranks nowhere.

Kim’s armed forces mirror his society’s tragic condition. They are an aging tribute to the Soviet forces of the 1970s. Any attempt to employ them against South Korea’s modern armed forces would end in devastating defeat for North Korea.

Kim also knows that missile attacks launched from his soil against the South Korea, Japan or the United States would result in the immediate and total destruction of his Stalinist regime.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has told Kim in very clear terms that if Kim launches an attack on his neighbors or the United States, he is on his own. The Chinese armed forces will stand by and watch as Kim’s regime is systematically annihilated.

To reiterate, the only way war breaks out in Northeast Asia is if the United States starts it. And this insight explains Kim’s strategy. His best chance of survival is to goad President Trump into attacking him. Then Beijing – despite the Chinese distaste for their North Korean neighbor – will be obligated to intervene to defend Kim’s regime.

With this point in mind, Kim has turned to Moscow, not Beijing, for help. Moscow sees Washington’s renewed interest in bringing down Kim as an opportunity. From Moscow’s perspective, North Korea is useful insofar as it can be leveraged in a high-stakes game to bring Washington into conflict with not only North Korea, but more importantly with China.

While China will not support North Korea in a war unleashed by the Kim regime, Beijing has said the Chinese Armed Forces will assist Kim if Washington attacks North Korea.

To promote conflict with China – something President Trump made less likely with his wise diplomacy toward China – Moscow is willing to provide just enough technical assistance to create the illusion of capability in North Korea.

The North’s recent missile launch is a case in point. The liquid-fueled rocket that North Korea launched into space recently lacked precision guidance, as well as a viable warhead. And, like its predecessors, the rocket broke up on reentry and crashed in pieces into the sea.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in summed up the 50-minute rocket test by saying it was not clear “whether the communist nation has in fact built nuclear weapons, let alone perfected its missile technology.”

For Washington, the right course of action is obvious. Don’t take the bait. As former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates warned some time ago: ""Any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have his head examined.”

The sole beneficiary of a conflict between the United States and China is Russia.

Like Serbia in 1914, North Korea is unpopular with virtually every nation in the world, including China. On the eve of World War I, the Guardian newspaper noted sarcastically that “if it were physically possible for Serbia to be towed out to sea and sunk there, the air of Europe would at once seem cleaner.” Most of the world would readily apply this description to North Korea.

Of course, in 1914 not a single European statesman regarded Serbia as a country so important that every major power in Europe – and eventually the world – would go to war over its future. Yet, thanks to Russia’s decision to mobilize its armies and back Serbia, that’s exactly what happened.

My advice to President Trump is simple: Mr. President, Moscow is inciting Rocket Man. Don’t take the bait.",North Korea won't start a war - Trump shouldn't launch an attack,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/10/north-korea-wont-start-war-trump-shouldnt-launch-attack.html

In theory, the holiday spirit is all about giving, not what you get. But that can be a tough sell with kids.

FOX's Lisa Brady reports in this week's 'FOX on Family':

For kids, the season of giving can be all about getting:

(Nuttle) ""And nowadays the pressure is so great to have the best toy or the most expensive clothes; it really is a pressure that kids are feeling.""

Author, speaker and mother-of-three Angela Nuttle, says it can be easier to give in than draw a line:

(Nuttle) ""I guarantee that parents can go into their kids' closet; the things that were so important last year, they're just sitting there in a box.""

Nuttle says she tries to focus on values and doing things together instead of buying things, which can include helping others, maybe visit a nursing home, mindful that the ultimate goal is training our kids for life:

(Nuttle) ""There are gonna be some painful moments where they don't get what they want, or what they think that they want.""

She also urges moms especially, don't drive yourself crazy striving for holiday perfection:

(Nuttle) ""You know mothers have a tendency to carry this mental load, like they have to do everything, they have to be responsible for everything.""

Nuttle says that's fueled by baggage, so put it down, allow yourself some boundaries.

Leona Evans, who was seriously injured, wound up in the water after driving her Hyundai Santa Fe across four lanes of traffic and through a fence on Friday.

""When we arrived, there was just this red SUV floating, wasn’t sitting, floating on the water in the middle of this retention pond,” Hillsborough County deputy Benjamin Thompson told FOX 13 Tampa.

Thompson and deputy Trent Migues arrived on the scene as several people who had witnessed the crash were trying to pull Evans' car out of the water.

""They had actually gotten a rope,” Thompson said. “They were trying to attach the car, thinking they could pull it back while it was floating.”

The station reported that Thompson dove into the pond and swam out to Evans. He then used his baton to smash the window of the SUV to get inside.

""I hit that window in the corner, and I hit it, and I hit it, and I hit it, and I hit it with all my life, then after about the 6th time it finally shattered,” he said. “And I knew the water was going to come in at that point, but I didn't realize how fast, it was like a waterfall, that car began to sink.""

Migues told reporters that ""the scariest moment was when her screaming stopped, and the roofline started going underneath the water, and my partner here disappeared in the car with her.""

Eventually, Thompson cut his face, arms and hands on jagged pieces of glass as he pulled Evans out of the vehicle.

They were then helped out of the water by Migues and the Good Samaritans.

“Year-over-year, we’re seeing about a 13% increase in our 7A loans, which are our flagship loans and just a little below that about a 12% increase in our 504 lending. We’re on fire going into this New Year. I think it’s the optimism that is in the marketplace relative to a tax reform, tax cuts, regulatory reform. All of these things are having such a positive impact,” she told FOX Business’ Charles Payne on “Making Money with Charles Payne.”

According to the SBA, small businesses make up approximately 99% of the U.S. economy.

McMahon explained what entrepreneurs have to consider before taking the risk of starting a new business.

“They feel there is an opportunity for them now. It’s worth taking the risk. Entrepreneurs are always balancing that risk factor against the downside, and you find more entrepreneurs now that are willing to take that risk.

“The micro lending that SBA is doing, our microloans under $50,000 primarily is where we’ve seen the greatest number of those loans and it’s just increasing, really going through the roof in terms of giving that seed capital to those small businesses to start,” she said.

McMahon also discussed how the SBA has helped veterans get back into the workplace.

“Our boots to business program that we have through our veterans outreach is just that, it’s to help our returning veterans who want to make that transition from the military into the business world. We offer programs for them and for their spouses to understand what is necessary, but also how to look at the skills that they have and how they transfer to businesses today, not only if they want to be employees but also if they want to start their own businesses,” she said.

Albuquerque police officer Ryan Holets was investigating a convenience store robbery when he walked behind the building and found a woman getting ready to inject heroin.

Holets turned on his bodycam and confronted the 35-year-old Crystal Champ and her companion before realizing the woman was pregnant.

“You’re going to kill your baby,” Holets is heard on the bodycam chastising Champ, who revealed she was “seven or eight months pregnant.”

Holets, who appears to be writing a citation for the couple in the beginning of the video, begins talking to Champ about her situation.

“It’s not every day I see a sight like that,” Holets said in an interview with CNN. “It just made me really sad.”

It was in that life-changing moment that Holets decided to intervene.

""I just felt God telling me, 'Tell her that you will do it because you can,’” Holets said to CNN.

That “it” was the father of four telling Champ he would like to adopt her baby.

Champ, who lives in a tent among the brush beside a highway in New Mexico, has battled addition to heroin and crystal meth for most of her life.

“I know how bad my situation is,” she told CNN. “I know what a horrible person I am.”

Champ had also “desperately wanted someone to adopt her baby,” Holets said and he wanted to be the one.

“I got so tired of seeing so many situations that I want to help, but can’t. But in that moment I realized I had a chance to help,” Holets continued.

After the conversation with Champ, Holets got in his squad car and drove immediately to his wife – with whom he had not yet discussed the magnanimous decision he made.

The police officer went right up to his wife and told her the whole story.

“He already knew my heart on the issue, and he knew that I would be totally onboard with it,” Holets’ wife, Rebecca, told CNN.

The couple had discussed adopting before, Yahoo reports, but wanted to wait until their youngest, who is 10 months old, was a little older.

The couple had no time to spare, though. Three weeks later, Champ gave birth to a baby girl, Hope. However, because of Champ’s drug use, Hope was born addicted to opioids, called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The syndrome can cause a lot of problems for growing infants like increased irritability, autonomic overreactivity and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, as well as developmental disorders later in life.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a child with NAS is born every 25 minutes in the U.S.

The Holetses have said when the time is right, they will tell Hope about the circumstances of her adoption, Yahoo reported.

“I just want her to be safe and secure and be in a family and be loved and have a chance,” Champ said.

After giving birth, with the Holetses at the hospital, she gave the couple Hope and said goodbye. “She turns to me and says, ‘Take care of her for me.’ And I said, ‘I will take good care of her, and you take good care of yourself.’ It was super emotional,” said Rebecca.

Grammer told BBC Radio 4 that the brutal death of his sister still haunts him, but he has since learned to forgive, but not to forget.

“I have learned to forgive. I have even told the guy I forgive him, although I don’t advocate his freedom. I don’t think that is reasonable,” Grammer said on the radio show.

In 1975, Grammer’s 18-year-old sister, Karen, was kidnapped outside of a restaurant by serial killer Freddie Glenn. Glenn reportedly raped the teenager before brutally attacking her, leaving her to die at the scene of the crime. Grammer identified his sister’s body a week later. He was just 20 at the time.

Glenn was convicted in 1976 for the killings Karen Grammer along with two other victims from the previous year. The Supreme Court made the decision to allow Glenn too seek parole after 30 years, but the former sitcom star has twice helped to block attempts for Glenn to get receive parole as justice for his sister and the other families who suffered loss.

At a parole hearing in 2009, Kelsey wrote a letter to the court which said: “She was my best friend and the best person I knew. She had so much to live for. I loved my sister, Karen. I miss her. I miss her in my bones.”

“I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her - I could not. I have never gotten over it... It very nearly destroyed me,” Grammer said.

Before his sister’s death, the 62-year-old star first experienced loss at the age of 13 when his father was killed during a home invasion. And following the death of his sister Karen, Grammer’s two half-brothers, Stephen and Billy, died in a scuba-diving accident in the Virgin Islands.

In April 2015, Grammer opened up to Vanity Fair about his struggle with drug and alcohol abuse and how his usage was triggered by the guilt he felt for his sister’s death.

“That was the time when I could not forgive myself for my sister’s death,” he confessed to the magazine. “I believe the gift of life and freedom he took from my sister precludes him from ever being allowed to enjoy that gift for himself. He took her future from her with no regard for her whatsoever. He assumed he had a right to do so. He assumed she was his property, and that the precious gift God gave her was his to take.”

Though Grammar has dealt with a lot of loss in his life, his shining light was the nearly two decades that he played Frasier on the popular 90s sitcom. Grammer told BBC Radio 4 that it “was a joy, always” to play Frasier – a character that he never got tired of playing.

“The beauty of playing Frasier was you could pretty much do everything. I mean, could pull out every trick I’ve got in my bag and it would still fit on “Frasier” he was loud and big and boisterous and then subtle and beautiful and touching, and you had all the notes you can play.”

Grammer’s private life, his marriages and romances are often found in the tabloids, but currently, the star remains happily married to Kayte Walsh, with whom he has three children.

“This lovely young woman lit up my world and changed my heart, which was a bit calloused and hardened against a lot of things,” he told Vanity Fair. “And we are good, and I feel young and alive.”",'Frasier' star Kelsey Grammer forgives his sister's killer but won't 'advocate for his freedom',http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/11/frasier-star-kelsey-grammer-forgives-his-sisters-killer-but-wont-advocate-for-his-freedom.html

1. Turn off your Echo's mic

The most vulnerable part of any Echo unit is its microphone, which absorbs all the sound in the room and may compromise your private conversations if it picks up the wrong words. To turn the mic off, press the microphone off/on button on the top. When the button is red, the mic is off. To reactivate it, just press the button again.

Then again, muting the mic will stop the Echo from hearing commands, rendering the device useless as a personal assistant. The always-on, always-listening nature of these smart virtual assistant speakers is what makes them truly compelling gadgets to have.

Sometimes, you may wish to switch off the mic for short periods, just for peace of mind. If you’re hosting a top-secret conversation in your home, you can switch Alexa off during the sensitive parts, then reactivate her later.

2. Turn off Voice Purchasing or set up a PIN code for purchases

“Alexa, buy more laundry detergent.” This is a pretty nifty trick, and it’s a major draw for people who like to shop for household items online. This may feel like one of its most futuristic features, but a single security breach could cost you dearly.

Personally, I’ve turned off my Echo's Voice Purchasing option and use Amazon's app or website to shop. To turn it off, open your Alexa app and tap Settings. Then scroll down, tap Voice Purchasing and toggle ""Purchase by voice"" to Off.

If you still want the convenience (and the sci-fi vibe) of Echo voice purchasing, set up a PIN code to avoid unauthorized purchases. To set it up, go to the same Voice Purchasing settings page on your Alexa app, toggle ""Purchase by Voice"" to On, then toggle ""Voice Code"" to On as well. This will prompt you to enter your four-digit PIN code.

Now, the four-digit code has to be spoken out to complete a purchase on your Echo. That said, anyone can simply listen in and reuse your code, so having a Voice Purchasing PIN is not foolproof.

3. Check your ‘Drop In’ settings

Back in June, Amazon introduced a new Echo feature called ""Drop In"" that works on all Echo gadgets, including the Dot and the Show. Drop In lets other Echos automatically connect to another Echo to start a conversation. The other party doesn't even have to pick the call; the line is automatically open and works just like an intercom system.

Although convenient in some ways, this can be a privacy issue, since people can ""drop in"" to your Echo and listen anytime. This is why it's vital that you check your Echo's Drop In settings.

Open your Alexa smartphone app and tap Settings. Under Devices, select the Echo speaker you want to modify. Scroll down and tap ""Drop In,"" and from here you can set it to On, Only My Household or Off.

You can set specific contacts to be able to drop in on you automatically by going to the Conversations tab (it looks like a text bubble icon) on your Alexa app and tapping the Contact icon (it's shaped like a person) in the top right corner. Based on your phone's contact list, the Alexa app will then list everyone who has an Echo

linked to their phone number (creepy, I know), and you simply toggle ""Contact can Drop In Anytime"" to On.

Beware that turning this on means that the contact can access your Echo devices automatically and drop in or listen and talk to them at any time.

To audit the contacts that are allowed to Drop In, go to the Contacts Menu again and check ""Others Who Can Drop In on my Devices"" to see everyone who is permitted. Simply tap Remove to revoke the contact's Drop In permissions.

Bonus: Switch off the Echo Show camera

If you haven’t seen it, the Echo Show is a mini-interactive TV screen with additional touchscreen controls. Selling for under $200, Show includes everything you loved about your speaker, plus transcribed song lyrics, surveillance footage of the baby’s room and video calls.

Video calls are an exciting tool, but many people find the camera to be as anxiety-inducing as the microphones. What does the camera see? Is it watching all day and night? How do you know if it’s been hacked? Many people put tape over the webcams on their laptops; they may feel compelled to do the same with their Echo Shows.

Luckily, the device’s camera and mics are very easy to turn off. There’s a button on the top of the Show that controls inputs. Just press it “off,” and both cameras and mics shut off. The front LED will also turn red, signifying that the inputs have been successfully shut down. You can still use the touch screen without a hitch.

By Barnini Chakraborty | Fox News

EXCLUSIVE – A Republican congressman plans to introduce a bill Monday that would threaten huge fines and prison time for elected officials accused of sheltering illegal immigrant criminals from deportation, in the wake of the not-guilty verdict in the Kate Steinle murder trial.

Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita’s bill is one of the most aggressive pieces of legislation to date aimed at sanctuary city policies, going beyond the Justice Department’s threat to cut off grants to those jurisdictions.

“Politicians don’t get to pick and choose what laws to comply with,” Rokita told Fox News. “Americans are dying because politicians sworn to uphold the law refuse to do so.”

His “Stopping Lawless Actions of Politicians (SLAP) Act” would hold state and local lawmakers criminally responsible for refusing to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The Republican’s bill would subject violators to a $1 million fine and up to five years in prison if they are convicted.

“It’s time the federal government gets serious about enforcing immigration laws and holding politicians accountable who conspire to break them,” said Rokita.

Rokita also supported “Kate’s Law” – legislation that would boost penalties for illegal immigrants who were previously deported and that was named after Steinle.

On Thursday, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, an illegal immigrant who already had been deported back to Mexico five times, was acquitted in the 2015 murder of Steinle on a San Francisco pier.

Zarate’s attorneys argued Zarate had found a gun that accidentally discharged, and the bullet ricocheted off the ground before hitting Steinle. Prosecutors argued Zarate intentionally shot 32-year-old Steinle.

The killing revived a national debate over sanctuary city policies, as some lawmakers as well as Steinle’s family faulted San Francisco for releasing the suspect from a local jail without notifying federal immigration officials.

President Trump, who frequently cited Steinle’s case on the campaign trail, called the not-guilty verdict “disgraceful” and a “complete travesty of justice.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions took direct aim at the city, saying San Francisco’s “decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.”",Fox News Exclusive: Will Officials Be Imprisoned for Sheltering Illegal Immigrant Criminals?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/04/fox-news-exclusive-will-officials-be-imprisoned-sheltering-illegal-immigrant-criminals

China, already known for rented girlfriends and boyfriends, is now offering people an opportunity to rent fake parents to avoid potentially awkward situations.

“Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend who wants to meet your parents but you actually don’t want them to meet?” asks one advert on the Chinese Internet, Yahoo Style reports.

But those acting as a stand-in parents aren’t the only ones advertising. Consumers are equally as vocal about needing a fake mom or dad.

CNN reported last May that Sessions didn’t disclose meetings he had with a Russian ambassador when he was a senator. The mainstream media was all over the story and significant airtime was spent portraying Sessions as shady and dishonest. In addition to embarrassing Sessions, the storyline also fed the narrative that the Trump administration colluded with Russia during the election.

The splashy headline on CNN’s website said, “First on CNN: AG Sessions did not disclose Russia meetings in security clearance form, DOJ says.” CNN’s story claimed the incident was “the latest example of Sessions failing to disclose contacts he had with Russian officials.” Roughly six months later, the network has admitted that the entire report was essentially meaningless.

“A newly released document shows that the FBI told an aide to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Sessions wasn't required to disclose foreign contacts that occurred in the course of carrying out his government duties when he was a senator,” CNN’s Evan Perez wrote on Monday.

“The FBI email from March bolsters the explanation by the Justice Department for why Sessions didn't disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador in his application for a US security clearance,” Perez continued.

President Trump has an ongoing feud with CNN, which has essentially implemented an anti-Trump programming strategy. As a result, the president often refers to CNN as “fake news” and the network has launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to shake that moniker with a “Facts First” initiative.

However, CNN had to issue an embarrassing correction on Friday when the Washington Post debunked the network's report claiming the Trump campaign had early, secret access to hacked DNC emails from WikiLeaks. The network on Friday inaccurately trumpeted that Congressional investigators obtained a mysterious 2016 email that was sent to Trump and other top aides, including Donald Trump Jr., which contained information on how to get a sneak peek at hacked information that WikiLeaks had acquired. The email, as CNN reported, offered a “decryption key” to access the files – but the network botched the date on the email, rendering the entire report irrelevant.

The Sessions gaffe and the date mishap result in back-to-back business days in which CNN was forced to correct a story that inaccurately portrayed the Trump administration in a negative light.

CNN was also widely panned on Monday when it focused on Trump’s Diet Coke intake while breaking news of a potential terror attack unfolded in New York.

Former Attorney General Eric Holder and ex-FBI Director James Comey fired back Sunday at President Trump, who claimed the FBI’s reputation is in “tatters” after its handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

“Nope. Not letting this go. The FBI’s reputation is not in 'tatters,'” Holder, who served as attorney general under President Obama, tweeted. “It’s composed of the same dedicated men and women who have always worked there and who do a great, apolitical job.”

By Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal



The Harvey Weinstein sexual-harassment fire burns on, consuming famous men. Corporations and institutions are on automated rapid response: proclaim zero tolerance and throw offenders into the street, while directing human-resources departments to design fine-grained standards of acceptable behavior.

It would be a comfort to think that HR specialists could solve this problem, but what has gone wrong runs deeper than calling in the lawyers. A question persists: How did this happen?

How have so many intelligent, accomplished adult men crashed across the boundaries of sex? Psychiatric explanations—reducing cause to a uniquely individual neurosis—are insufficient. This isn’t just “really weird stuff.”

Some may have a distant memory of the culture wars of the 1990s. This looks like a moment to revisit some of its battlefields.

Incidents of sexual abuse on this scale don’t randomly erupt. They grow from the complex climate of a nation’s culture. These guys aren’t blips or outliers. These men are a product of their times.

“Women get facials, they get their manicure, they get their hair done and their whole body scrubbed,” says Jay Ree, a stylist at the John Barrett “head spa,” which opened at the Fifth Avenue department store this fall. “The only thing that’s missing is their scalp.”

A post shared by Gisoo Salon (@gisoosalon) on Oct 26, 2017 at 12:19pm PDT

Scalp care is the new skin care. Beauty companies such as R+Co, IGK and Briogeo have recently launched scalp scrubs, shampoos or treatments. And an increasing number of NYC spas such as Pierre Michel Salon and Elizabeth Arden’s Red Door are increasingly adding scalp “facials” to their menus — which promise that scrubs and lengthy scalp massages for around $50 to $75 will reduce dirt, debris and gunk that clog your follicles. John Barrett’s treatment, which includes a scalp steam and a blowout, goes for $250.

'THIGHLIGHTING' IS THE PAINFUL NEW PLASTIC SURGERY FAD

“I think before, people only thought they had a scalp problem if they had dandruff or psoriasis and were going to a dermatologist,” says the NYC-based Nancy Twine, founder of Briogeo, whose natural, scalp-revival shampoo is currently the top-selling shampoo on Sephora. “But now more people are realizing that scalp care is important.”

The hair follicle looks and acts very much like the pores on your face. Just as bacteria and dirt in the pores can cause acne and irritation, so, too, can it affect the hair follicle. “There’s just build-up from using products, especially if they’re silicon-based, and over time they start to build up bad bacteria that can cause inflammation and itchiness and even hair loss,” says Twine.

Ree says that New Yorkers have it particularly bad.

“Pollution definitely plays a big part in scalp hygiene,” he says. Ree explains that at the head spa, the stylists take a picture of clients’ scalps using a magnifying lens — and the results are horrifying. “They’ll see a big buildup of mucus, usually on the bottom of the hair follicle, or the scalp is very oily, it’s cracked, it’s dry. It’s gross.”

Another potential culprit, says Twine: dry shampoo, which is applied directly to the scalp to help users go longer between washes, but can clog follicles in the process.

Twine says that taking care of your scalp isn’t rocket science. She recommends washing one’s hair at least once a week and using a scalpcentric shampoo — one with essential oils, such as tea tree or peppermint, with anti-fungal properties and detoxifying ingredients such as clay or activated charcoal — once every one to two weeks. And the most important thing to do is use your fingers to rigorously massage your scalp every time you shampoo. “It really does help loosen the dirt and oil,” she says.

Ree says he thinks the new scalp shampoos and products will revolutionize the way we think about our hair and skin. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and I’ve never seen anything that can combat scalp buildup before,” he says. “It’s quite fascinating.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is backing a two-week spending bill, time, he says to reach agreement on larger issues:

(McConnell) ""That the caps are gonna be and the other provisions that are gonna be part of the year-end spending measure.""

One of those issues is a DACA-fix, designed to reinstate deportation protections for young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children:

(Schumer) ""There are good negotiations occurring between Democrats and Republicans to come up with a good DACA program as well as some good border security.""

The country music star joined a list of other famous men such as Bradley Cooper, Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson who have received the title.

According to the Government of Accountability Office (GAO) report, which was released on Monday, the VA is required to report providers to a national database designed to prevent them from crossing state lines and endangering other patients. However, based on a sampling of 148 providers at five unidentified VA hospitals who required review, officials had only reported nine health care workers since 2014, and none had been reported to state licensing boards.

The GAO noted that much of the failed reporting came as a result of confusion about VA policies and responsibilities, as well as months or years-long delays in the review process. For instance, in cases involving 16 providers, the process was not started until after more than three months had passed.

Service chiefs were not made aware of the reviews for up to 13 months after the incidents, during which three of the providers had an additional “concerning episode of care.” The report also noted a lack of knowledge regarding required documentation of medical care.

“At one facility, we found that officials failed to report six providers to the (national database) because the officials were unaware that they had been delegated responsibility for … reporting,” the GAO said.

One case involved a doctor who resigned while under review for misconduct, but was not reported to a state licensing board. The doctor was later hired at a non-VA facility within the same state, only to be disciplined for the same unreported misconduct that had prompted the initial review.

Once again, a supposed big break in the drive to destroy President Trump over “collusion” with the Russians during the 2016 campaign stands exposed as nothing more than bad reporting. Plus, the professionalism of the FBI looks compromised by anti-Trump bias.

The media went berserk Friday on news that former Trump confidante Mike Flynn had copped a plea deal with special counsel Bob Mueller. All the usual suspects launched an orgy of speculation on what beans Flynn “must” have spilled.

It all went into overdrive when ABC’s Brian Ross reported that Flynn had been instructed to reach out to Moscow during the campaign: This seemed to be the long-awaited proof of collusion with Vladimir Putin against Hillary Clinton.

Except that Ross retracted the claim hours later: The reach-out was only after Election Day, when any president-elect is expected to start connecting with other world leaders, US-friendly or not.

ABC has now suspended Ross for four weeks without pay — modest punishment for an error that probably had a lot to do with the stock market’s dive early Friday.

Meanwhile, news broke of another supposedly neutral dirt-digger in hot water for having a political agenda: Mueller, it turns out, kicked a top FBI agent off his team for apparent anti-Trump bias.

The Justice Department’s inspector general this summer launched a probe of alleged Trump-bashing texts by Peter Strzok, one of the top FBI counterintelligence investigators. That obliged Mueller, already under fire for hiring several pro-Hillary lawyers for his team, to oust Strzok from his Russian-meddling investigation.

Remarkably, the agent had also been a key player in the probe into Clinton’s mishandling of classified information via her secret use of that unsecure private server for all her government work. He’s now in deep freeze with a job at FBI Human Resources.

""Bicycles were no longer considered 'combat' vehicles,"" said Dutch-based World War II bicycle collector and author Johan Willaert.
Yet, soldiers did ride bikes into combat; notably the Japanese soldiers who used these to speed troops down the Malay Peninsula in 1941.","In many parts of the world the bicycle is the main means of transportation as people commute to work. Cycling, for many people, is a way of life, but it also has deep roots in military history throughout the world.

A forerunner of the bicycle was first devised by German Baron Karl Von Drais in 1818, but took many years to be refined into the vehicle that we know today. Frenchmen Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement created the pedal driven system that propelled the rider, as well as other innovations.

It didn't take long for the military thinkers of the late 19th century to see the merits of utilizing this new means of transportation. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) bicycles were tested by dispatch riders and scouts with little- if-any success, but that didn't deter others from seeing the benefits that the bicycle had to offer.

The British military used bicycle scouts in field maneuvers in spring exercises in 1885, and, soon after, the armies of Austria and Germany each reconsidered the possibilities of utilizing the two-wheeled contraptions, while the French military formally reintroduced the bicycle into service in 1887.

EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS

""Various nations' military embraced new technologies,"" explained John Adams-Graf, editor of “Military Vehicles” magazine.

""With the advent of the pedal bicycle, military minds recognized the efficiency of transporting troops via a mode that required no feed, no special care, or any rest,"" Adams-Graf told Fox News. ""Bicycle-borne troops could move longer distances than troops on foot.""

However, the bicycle wasn't exactly embraced by everyone in the era.

""Army brass were all cavalry officers,"" said Colin Kirsh, author of the book “Bad Teeth No Bar: A History of Military Bicycles in the Great War”

THE LONG GUNS: HISTORY OF US MILITARY RIFLES

""As bicycles had started to replace horses in civilian life they were worried that if they approved the use of bicycles for military purposes that they would replace the cavalry,"" Kirsh told Fox News. ""In the early days, cycle enthusiasts were considered cranks. Soldiers wore the King's uniform and were expected to conduct themselves in a manner that reflected that. Leaning over a bicycle was considered uncouth.""

As the bicycle's design changed, it allowed the rider to carry himself in a more ""military fashion,"" which helped convince the old guard military thinkers that the two-wheeled contraptions had a place alongside the horse.

By the end of the 19th century Britain had the largest cycling industry in the world noted Kirsch, and this was likely why the bike rolled across South Africa in some numbers during the Second Anglo-Boer War.

""Bicycles were already in use throughout South Africa; the Boers set up a small force of cyclists, and the British followed suit,"" added Kirsh, who explained it was a matter of timing.

HISTORY OF THE 'JEEP' IN PICTURES

""There were no motorized vehicles yet, and cycles had developed into a practical form,"" noted Kirsch. ""So in the late 1890s the bicycle ruled the road.""

Across the Atlantic the Americans also began to see the potential that bicycles had to offer. The First Signal Corps of the Connecticut National Guard formed the first military bicycle unit in 1891, when the bicycle was used by messengers and relay riders. Various challenges ensued including one that had a Connecticut National Guard cyclist prove he alone could deliver a message faster than an entire flag signaler team, while a relay team carried a single dispatch from Chicago to New York City in just four days and 13 hours, with much of it in rainy weather. A follow-up challenge brought a message from Washington, D.C. to Denver in just over six days!

Across the country from Connecticut at Montana's Fort Missoula 2nd Lieutenant James A. Moss organized the 25th Infantry Bicycle Corps, which consisted of eight soldiers riding in formation and pedaling as much as 40 miles each day. Each bike was fitted with a knapsack, blanket roll and shelter half tent. In addition each rider carried a rifle along with 50 rounds of ammunition.

The Bicycle Corps took part in an 800-mile journey from Fort Missoula to Yellowstone National Park and back, and then journeyed from Fort Missoula to St. Louis, a journey of some 1,900 miles. All this was to prove the possibility of the unit's ability to travel great distances into combat. However, the corps was disbanded just prior to the outbreak of the Spanish-American War.

Bicycles in the World Wars

Across America and Europe it was clear that the bicycle could be used to deliver messages, but military planners adapted it for use with portable topographers and even telegraphers. In one case a rider used his bike to study the grade of hills and other terrain to help commanders in the field determine if the land was traversable with cannons and wagons.

HISTORIC BOMBERS IN PICTURES

When World War I broke out in 1914 many nations had units that were prepared to ride into combat, but as the war soon became a stalemate of muddy trenches and little movement the bicycle's role diminished. As with the cavalry's horses the bicycle was mainly relegated to use behind the lines.

However, a generation later the bicycle played a more direct role as the Germans, Japanese and British utilized it as a way to move the troops to the front if not directly into combat.

""Bicycles were no longer considered 'combat' vehicles,"" said Dutch-based World War II bicycle collector and author Johan Willaert. ""However bicycles continued to be used in supporting roles on airfields, depots and camps and were a relatively fast, economic and light way of getting around.""

Yet, soldiers did ride bikes into combat; notably the Japanese soldiers who used these to speed troops down the Malay Peninsula in 1941. These soldiers rode the bikes on the rims when the tires went flat as rubber was in short supply. In Europe the bicycle saw use in equally unexpected locales!

HISTORY OF REMOTE WEAPONS IN PICTURES

""One example is that some troops of the Canadian 3rd Division came ashore on Juno Beach, Normandy on June 6th, 1944 equipped with the British made BSA Folding bicycles,"" Willaert told Fox News. ""They were to be ridden by Infantry towards the initial objective of the different units where they would be discarded and the real fighting began.""

The BSA was also utilized by British paratroopers.

""The thinking behind the paratroop folding bicycle was that it would give foot soldiers some distinct advantages,"" explained Alex Cranmer of New Jersey-based International Military Antiques.

""The War Department felt a paratrooper could cover up to 25 miles on foot in a 24-hour period, however, given a bicycle the same soldier could cover up to 75 miles in a 24 hour period,"" Cranmer told Fox News. ""Furthermore, a bicycle was relatively silent compared to a motorized scooter or vehicle. The issue really come down to the tires, once damaged it rendered the bicycle useless, which is why the BSA folding paratrooper bicycle was far better on paper than on the battlefield.""

RISE OF THE MACHINES? THE DANGER OF AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS

After World War II most nations ceased using bicycles, apart from Switzerland, which produced a military bicycle that is almost as ubiquitous as its ""Swiss Army Knife."" The Swiss Bicycle Infantry was introduced in 1905 and only phased out in 2001, and for nearly 100 years the bikes that the mountain nation used were known for their high quality and equally high durability.

And long before the mountain bike craze that began in California and Colorado in the 1970s the bicycle was a true-off road means of transport in the jungles of Vietnam where the Vietcong and North Vietnam forces each utilized bicycles in great numbers.

More recently bicycles have been used by some Special Forces units in Afghanistan, proving that after nearly 150 years since the French experimented with scouts on two wheels that the bike may still have a role with the military.

""There are situations in today's tactical environments for bicycle use – not in large scale troop movements, but rather, in special operations in mountainous terrain where the rider could take advantage of the great leaps in mountain bike design,"" suggested Adams-Graf. ""Of course, if future conflicts left a nation without petroleum or electrical power sources, feet on the pedals will always work to get a soldier from point A to point B! Bicycles are tools that modern warfare planners should remember.""",The forgotten role of the bicycle in wartime: How soldiers rode into action on two wheels,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/12/11/forgotten-role-bicycle-in-wartime-how-soldiers-rode-into-action-on-two-wheels.html

People took the question to social media where some were supportive, commenting, “Love her and her armpits hair.”

One was especially moved by the look and wrote on Instagram, “I praise Gigi for this! Show the world that women DO grow body hair and that it shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of just because we’re female.”

While others were disgusted by the possibility and said, “Her armpits not shaved ewwwww.”

While the shape of the German automaker’s luxury four-door coupe hasn’t changed much in this all-new version, under the hood things are very different.

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS marks the return of an inline-six-cylinder engine to the Mercedes lineup, now with electric assist. Mercedes notes that it is the first vehicle in its lineup with a starter-generator integrated into its 9-speed transmission that gives the 362-horsepower 3.0-liter motor an extra 21 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque in short bursts.

Many upgrades to the CLS can be found also in the interior, which can now seat five passengers. Those inside will be treated with many comforting features such as ambient lighting, illuminated air vents, a 12.3-inch high-resolution central display, wireless smartphone charging, and a fully digital dash. If one monitor isn't enough, a dual set of displays combined under one piece of glass to create even more of a cockpit feel is optional. And, if you're feeling a certain way, you can use Mercedes' Energizing Comfort program, which links the functions of the climate control system, fragrance, lighting and music to tailor to one of six different moods.

To keep its passengers safe as well as comfortable, the new CLS offers a host of technologies, including an automatic emergency braking system and a feature called Pre Safe Sound that emits a signal to help protect their eardrums from the high pressure noises that often accompany a collision.

A semi-autonomous Driver Assistance Package that allows the CLS to steer itself within a lane and even change lanes when the driver hits the turn signal is also available, along with a set of adjustable air springs that improve ride and handling regardless of who is in control.

We need a new tax plan to support American innovation, because our history and success as a nation derive from our primacy in this area. Our relatively young nation has excelled because of our scrappy, can-do entrepreneurial culture and diverse immigrant roots. We’re all attracted by – and based in – bedrock of strong constitutional freedoms. This alone makes us unique.

Taxes have become the weakest link in our nation’s innovation strategy. In January, at the world’s largest innovation event, CES, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) will release our first-ever International Innovation Scorecard, gauging the innovation-friendliness of 38 countries plus the EU.

The scorecard judges each nation on a total of 27 indicators across 12 categories. It lays out a strategy that says innovation is tied to having an environment that embraces disruptive technologies, promotes civil and economic liberties and fosters a diverse and talented population. Spoiler alert – the U.S. does well, but not by every measure. Our country’s worst score is in the tax category.

Technology drives the U.S. economy, supporting 15.3 million U.S. jobs and accounting for ten percent of gross domestic product in 2015 alone. Imagine a tax system that can further unleash America’s strongest industries to compete more vigorously.

Simply put, our tax laws today – along with our immigration policies – incentivize American companies to shift jobs abroad. Our rates are so high that there is a perverse incentive for American companies to be acquired by foreign companies who enjoy a lower tax rate. By lowering corporate taxes and shifting to a territorial system of taxation the rest of the world uses, U.S. companies will have a level playing field and be able to invest in and hire more American workers.

Lowering corporate tax rates give companies more money to invest. And much of that investment will be in people, machinery, software and services, making our companies better and economy stronger.

Last year, for the first time in 30 years, more U.S. manufacturing jobs were created or returned from overseas than left our country. Technology drives the U.S. economy, supporting 15.3 million U.S. jobs and accounting for ten percent of gross domestic product in 2015 alone. Imagine a tax system that can further unleash America’s strongest industries to compete more vigorously.

While every interest group in Washington lobbied Congress to make these good bills perfect and will now be in conference committee negotiations, I suggest a different tack. Let’s make them better by ensuring they add less to our crushing national debt.

As a matter of long-standing policy, CTA does not lobby or ask the federal government for money specifically for our industry. We have not sought, nor are we receiving in the tax bill special deals for innovators and the technology industry. But our corporate leaders believe the growing federal debt is an existential problem threatening our nation and our children’s future.

Thus, to make the tax plan better, we should reduce the cost and debt burden by showing some flexibility on the corporate tax rate. Twenty percent is ideal, but its cost is high.

We can’t make the great the enemy of the good. But we also can’t make our desire for tax reform and lower rates a burden on our children that will shift all federal spending to entitlements and interest on the federal debt. We need funds to support our national defense and we need discretionary spending in the future.

As president of Fortune and chief content officer of Time Inc. Alan Murray continues to report, many CEOs are concerned that the tax bill rushing through Congress is good in the short term but the increase in the debt it engenders will hurt us in the long term. If business leaders are expressing this concern, and willing to go above 20 percent as our new corporate tax rate, Congress should listen – our kids are counting on it.",Taxes have become the weakest link in our innovation strategy.

According to the source, the testimony topics will include the role played in the Hillary Clinton email investigation by Peter Strzok, a former deputy to the assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI who was removed from the staff of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III earlier this year after Mueller learned Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump texts with a colleague.

House investigators previously told Fox News they have long regarded Strzok as a key figure in the chain of events when the bureau, in 2016, received the infamous anti-Trump “dossier” — which McCabe will be asked about Tuesday — and launched a counterintelligence investigation into possible Russian meddling in the election.

The “dossier” was a compendium of salacious and largely unverified allegations about then-candidate Trump and others around him that was compiled by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., previously sought documents and witnesses from the Justice Department and FBI to determine what role, if any, the dossier played in the move to place a Trump campaign associate under foreign surveillance.

McCabe also will be asked about Strzok’s consequential portfolio. He participated in the FBI’s fateful interview with Hillary Clinton on July 2, 2016 — just days before then-FBI Director James Comey announced he was declining to recommend prosecution of Clinton in connection with her use, as secretary of state, of a private email server.

Strzok also oversaw the bureau’s interviews with ousted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and changed Comey’s early draft language about Clinton’s actions regarding her private email server from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.”

The decision by the NFL Compensation Committee on Wednesday to give Commissioner Roger Goodell a five-year contract extension that could top out at nearly $40 million a year is pure craziness. NFL owners are watching their brand implode and TV ratings for games plummet under a reckless commissioner – and they fail to see that Goodell is running the wrong game plan.

Giving Goodell a huge compensation package like this – 90 percent of it tied to incentives – is like giving Hillary Clinton an award for outstanding email practices and honesty.

Goodell’s contract extension is a slap in the face to everyone who cares about showing respect for our national anthem, the American flag, Americans serving in the military and veterans. Continuing to alienate conservatives will prove to be the single worst business decision in the history of the NFL.

It has never been the American way to treat customers like the enemy or alienate a wide group of your brand’s audience. Yet Goodell and his protesting players have managed to do this.

And liberal politicians around the country should take note that black voters are catching on to their schemes.
The black community is worth about as much to progressives as a postage stamp.","Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee in Alabama’s senate race, is desperate for black votes. With support from key black lawmakers like New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and Georgia Representative John Lewis, the Jones campaign hopes black voters will come out in big numbers on Tuesday’s election. In fact, as many pundits have noted, his election victory will largely rely on their support.

Ostensibly, Jones holds a tremendous advantage to win the black vote. African-Americans, a quarter of the Alabama electorate, make up the majority of Democratic voters in the state. He himself prosecuted the KKK members who killed the four girls in the 1963 bombing of 16th street Baptist Church in Birmingham. And his opponent is an easy target. Roy Moore has not only been accused of sexual assault and pedophilia, but recently received blowback for his comments which critics say romanticized slavery.

Jones only has one small problem when it comes to the black vote: all he has to offer the black community is a tone-deaf flyer:

The flyer highlights Moore’s sexual abuse allegations and prominently displays a photo of a skeptical black man under the text ""Think if a black man went after high school girls, anyone would try to make him a senator?""

Here’s the problem. The flyer is predicated upon two faulty assumptions about black voters. First, it assumes that black people only care about issues of race. In other words, a black person wouldn’t be as appalled at an accusation of pedophilia as a white person—unless the accusation is somehow linked to racism. I could be missing something, but even the greatest race-baiters in the country haven’t tried to make the Moore allegations a race issue.

Secondly, and most importantly, the flyer implies that black voters don’t care about issues facing their community. But black citizens, like all Americans, are interested in issues like the economy, education and a better future for their children. Jones either thinks blacks aren’t worthy of the same policy conversations as white voters or he has no policy prescriptions that would lead to better outcomes for them. Both ideas are troubling.

Even the far-left publication, The Root, raised issue with the flyer. In an op-ed, the author Michael Harriot rightly comments:

“On the rare occasions when the Democratic Party does address black voters, it only talks about the “black issues”: policing, mass incarceration, civil rights, etc. For the party leadership, black people aren’t whole people who have the same concerns about taxes, job creation, education initiatives, international policy and economics as other voters. They are simply bodies collected in the coffers of the party’s ineffective longing for power.”

Liberal politicians around the country should take note that black voters are catching on to their schemes.

White liberals employ the same strategy every election cycle. When they need votes (and only when they need votes), they return to the black community with the same lines about how their opponent is a closet racist. Then they give shallow promises that rarely ever make it to their legislative agenda. But if they can stoke enough fear and guarantee enough unicorns, then perhaps they can win the election.

However, with the outrage following Jones’ mailer and with early indications that black voters might stay at home on Tuesday, this strategy looks to be a failure in Alabama. And liberal politicians around the country should take note that black voters are catching on to their schemes.

To be fair, conservatives have their own issues talking to black voters. While I believe their policies are best-suited to lead to flourishing communities, they fail to effectively sell those policies to people who need them the most. As I have mentioned before, conservatives shouldn’t be afraid to present their case in places where they may be unpopular.

But for liberals, the issue is even worse because black Americans have consistently voted them into office with nothing in return. In fact, when questioned about the flyer controversy on the ""Black Eagle"" radio show on Sirius/XM on Friday, Doug Jones hardly cared:

""That mailer kind of speaks for itself…You know, maybe we could've used a little bit different language.""

He’s right. The mailer speaks for itself. The black community is worth about as much to progressives as a postage stamp.",Alabama Democrats need black voters on Tuesday.

Morris, a big-game pitcher, and Trammell, a star shortstop, were picked by a 16-man Modern Baseball Era committee that considered 10 candidates whose biggest contributions came from 1970-87.

Morris got 14 votes and Trammell drew 13, one more than the minimum needed.

They'll be enshrined on July 29. Fitting that they'll go in together -- they both began their big league careers in 1977 with Detroit, and played 13 seasons alongside each other with the Tigers.

""Time has made this even more special. I've learned a lot along the way,"" the 62-year-old Morris said on a conference call.

Former catcher Ted Simmons fell one vote short of election and former players' union head Marvin Miller was five shy of the 12 needed for election.

A durable right-hander, Morris posted 254 wins. His most famous victory was a 10-inning shutout, winning 1-0 for Minnesota over Atlanta in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.

""No question it was my defining moment in baseball,"" Morris said. ""I've never pitched a game where I had better focus. I never had a negative thought, even though I was in trouble several times.""

Morris had a 3.90 ERA, the highest of any pitcher in the Hall. He also won World Series in Detroit -- with Trammell, in 1984 -- and Toronto in 1992.

Now 59, Trammell was a steady presence in the middle of the diamond while playing all 20 of his seasons in Detroit.

Trammell was the 1984 World Series MVP, hitting .450 as the Tigers trounced San Diego in five games and finished off a season in which they started out 35-5.

A six-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glover, Trammell scored 1,231 runs and drove in 1,003. He batted .285 with 185 home runs and a .352 on-base average -- he walked 850 times and struck out 874.

Trammell never came close to election during his 15 tries on the Hall ballot in voting by Baseball Writers' Association of America members. His best showing came in his last year, when he got 40.9 percent in 2016.

Morris got a lot closer.

Starting at 22 percent in his first Hall ballot appearance in 2000, Morris peaked at 67.7 percent in 2003, falling 42 short. He dropped to 61.5 percent four years ago in his final time on the writers' ballot, 78 votes shy.

Hall of Fame players George Brett, Rod Carew, Dennis Eckersley, Don Sutton, Dave Winfield and Robin Yount were on the panel that voted.

Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Dave Parker and Luis Tiant also were on the ballot.

Miller, who headed the players' union from 1966-82 was on the ballot for the seventh time.

Miller drew 44 percent in 2003 and 63 percent in 2007 when all Hall of Famers could vote on the veterans panel. After the Hall downsized the committee, he got 3 of 12 votes in 2007, 7 of 12 in 2009 and 11 of 16 in 2010, one fewer than the necessary 75 percent. Four years ago, he was at least six votes shy.

In 2008, four years before he died, Miller sent a letter to the BBWAA saying he didn't want to be considered anymore.

The case before our nation’s highest court is called Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The organization that I lead, Alliance Defending Freedom, is representing the cake shop and its owner, cake artist Jack Phillips.

Phillips said he couldn’t design a custom wedding cake for two men who requested it. He declined because using his artistic talents to celebrate a same-sex marriage would violate his Christian faith and his artistic freedom.

The two men then filed a lawsuit against him. But contrary to what they allege, Phillips didn’t discriminate against them. While he can’t create cakes that celebrate what his faith prohibits, he offered to sell the men anything else in his shop or to design a cake for them for another occasion.

The new McLaren Senna was unveiled in England, a new hypercar in the automaker's stable complete with 800 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque motivating just 2,641 pounds of mass.

The mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive car boasts a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 at its heart, sunk deep into an ultra-lightweight carbon fiber chassis wrapped in more carbon fiber, with an aggressive stance and functional aerodynamics hammering every stretch of pavement it conquers. McLaren didn't specify performance, but with a lighter weight and more power than the 720S, it's reasonable to assume that it will sprint to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds with a top speed well past 200 mph.

Distantly related to the McLaren 720S, the Senna follows the P1 in terms of performance and in the automaker's series of ""Ultimate"" cars—but not in propulsion.

The Senna takes its motivation from the 4.0-liter turbocharged V-8 alone (no hybrid powertrain) and trims more fat from the 720S, if there was any to be found on that car at all. On top of uprated performance from the V-8, the Senna adds more downforce and more functional aerodynamics to stick it to the ground.

A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic handles the furious shifting duties that the V-8 demands, while a double wishbone suspension system with interconnected dampers and constantly monitors the road to stick all four wheels firmly on terra firma. The system uses a kinetic roll system to replace mechanical antiroll bars to independently adjust the dampers for better compression and rebound. Configurable race modes toggle through Comfort, Sport, Track, and Race modes depending on conditions and, of course, the driver's courage.

The cockpit is similar to the 720S in terms of two passengers, side-by-side to wail down streets or a track. The interior is stark and spartan: there's no room for interior storage, the start button is above the driver's head like a jet fighter, and exposed struts for the car's dihedral doors—similar to the F1's doors—open and close to offer a view of the car's extreme aerodynamic accoutrements. The dash, wheel, doors, and paddle shifters are exposed carbon fiber; the large touchscreen is the only high-tech controller found in the cockpit.

The car's extreme aerodynamics take their cues from the 720S, but are shaved of any unnecessary elements to reduce weight. Every bit of the Senna, including headlights and taillights serve as cooling ducts for the engine or to whisk high-pressure airflow away from the car and toward the back of the massive dual-stage carbon fiber wing that's nearly 4 feet above the rear deck.

McLaren will produce 500 examples of the Senna and it will cost $1 million for buyers who've already snapped up every example.

The McLaren Senna will make its public debut at the 2018 Geneva motor show next March.","New McLaren Senna unleashed, lightest hypercar in automaker's ""Ultimate"" stable",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/12/11/new-mclaren-senna-unleashed-lightest-hypercar-in-automakers-ultimate-stable.html

We see this growing intensity behind the narrative that black lives are in danger, that black people are victims and that white privilege is the culprit.","I am the great granddaughter of slaves from Alabama. I can’t imagine how horrible their lives must have been. I have no idea how long ago my earlier ancestors were captured in Africa and shipped to America in chains, their lives suddenly turned into nightmares.

My great grandparents were deprived of the “unalienable rights” of “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness” proclaimed in America’s Declaration of Independence – a document that says “all men are created equal.” The ugliness and injustice of their slavery made a mockery of the beautiful words of the great Declaration.

I thank God that the immoral, sinful institution of slavery is long gone. It was a cancer of the soul of our great country. But it’s good to be reminded sometimes just how bad things were in the past, so that we can fully appreciate our lives today.

We have a lot to appreciate today – even though sometimes many of us forget that. America is the greatest nation on Earth. And while racism has not disappeared, America is our home. What house can stand if its inhabitants are divided?

Recently my family and I visited one of the stations along the underground railroad outside of Philadelphia to retrace the steps of escaped slaves.

The underground railroad wasn’t actually a railroad. It was a series of safe houses – “stations” they were called – that provided refuge to escaped slaves from the South risking their lives to seek the freedom that was their God-given human right. They often traveled at night and on foot – never knowing if they would be captured and enslaved once again.

Imagine, if you can, stepping into the shoes of an escaped slave – if they had shoes, that is. Imagine summoning up the courage to walk up the back steps of one of those safe houses.

Trembling, you knock on the door. Fear and hope fill your racing heart. When the person on the other side opens the door you wrestle the passwords from your lips: “A friend of a friend sent me.”

You hope beyond hope that the person opening the door is truly a friend, and that the door will be another step on your road to freedom. You hope the person will provide you with refuge – and not a whip, or chains, or a bullet.

While at the safe house, we had the opportunity to read some of the stories of the escaped slaves recorded by William Still, one of the founders of the underground railroad.

One of the stories hit a chord with me because it was about a mother I could readily identify with. The woman was named Betsy, a slave who fled to freedom because her baby boy almost died one day while she was laboring in the field of her master. Think about that word – her master. Someone who owned her as if she was a dog instead of a human being.

It’s a daunting thing to consider that truly was a reality for many who looked very much like me and my two beautiful black babies. I don’t know what this feels like. Not one black American alive today knows what this feels like.

Betsy wanted the freedom to care for her baby and she wanted her son to grow up in freedom, instead of worrying that he would be taken from her and sold to the highest bidder at an auction. This brave woman, in her heart, wanted what I and every mother wants – the best for our children.

So what does this all have to do with today – particularly for the lives of black Americans?

Betsy was a slave. Her whole environment told her she was not even human. She had no rights. At any moment, her master could radically change her situation and she would be able to do nothing about it. Yet, she was not helpless. She would not succumb to “white privilege.” She and her posterity would be free.

As we look at the culture around us today, the agitation is palpable. We see this growing intensity behind the narrative that black lives are in danger, that black people are victims and that white privilege is the culprit. Innocent lives are being lost, blood is being spilled and opportunities are being wasted.

There may be those in very high places who are constantly telling you that you’re a victim, that it’s someone else’s fault, that you can’t achieve this or that because the odds are stacked against you. Ignore them.

My message to my fellow black Americans is simple: There may be those in very high places who are constantly telling you that you’re a victim, that it’s someone else’s fault, that you can’t achieve this or that because the odds are stacked against you. Ignore them.

We are not slaves! We are free! I am not a victim, my children are not victims, and all black people are no longer victims. We are smart, talented, hardworking and have the same legal rights as all other Americans.

We have received a great inheritance from our strong and proud ancestors. We are victors. You have not been fatally wounded. Remember that.

If Betsy could succeed, you can succeed. Learn from our shared history of struggle, study hard and work hard and write a story of triumph over adversity that your grandchildren and great grandchildren will be proud to read.

You can be more than your environment. Just believe. And may God bless America, where the beautiful ideals of the Declaration of Independence are belatedly but finally accepted and embraced by our great nation.",The nightmare of slavery should make us appreciate the blessings of today,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/10/nightmare-slavery-should-make-us-appreciate-blessings-today.html

On the roster: Who’s really got poll position in Alabama? - Trump accusers to unite, seek Hill probe - Dems look to ease divisions ahead of midterms - Scramble to correct errors of haste in tax plan - Eject!

WHO’S REALLY GOT POLL POSITION IN ALABAMA?

What’s the deal with that Fox News poll in Alabama?

If Republican Roy Moore is leading in an average of all polls, why does the one from FNC call it a blowout for Democrat Doug Jones?



The answer is plain: There’s simply no precedent for this race.

The way pollsters make their predictions is to look at how voters behaved before and then make an educated guess on what patterns will be like this time.

If you’re polling, say, Missouri for a presidential election, you can look immediately at the three or four elections before and get a sense of who will be showing up to vote and in what numbers, e.g. 53 percent female, 40 percent aged 45-64, 79 percent white, etc.

Then you keep calling folks until you get a representative sample of respondents that looks like the expected electorate, ask your questions and presto!

But what election would tell us how Alabama would vote? There hasn’t been a competitive special election for a seat in Alabama since 1978, so there’s no direct analogue. Will it be more like a big statewide midterm election with something like 50 percent turnout, or closer to the 25 percent typical of a single-office race?

The pollsters at Monmouth University have a survey out today and they have helpfully for the purposes of explanation hedged their bets. Their best model comes up with a tie, but they have also offered two other turnout scenarios, one slightly favoring Moore and one slightly favoring Jones.

Our pollsters don’t hedge, and, as their track record has shown, they don’t need to.

Take it from our polling maven, Dana Blanton, who offered today this opinion-science version of a smack down: “A subtle but potentially noteworthy finding is Alabama voters who were interviewed on cellphones are +30 for Jones, while the race is roughly even among all others. The fact that traditional, high-quality probability samples, like the Fox News Poll, include both landline and cellphone numbers may be why these polls show Jones doing relatively well compared to automated or blended polls.”



Put simply: Because our poll is better, we’re in a better position to see parts of the electorate that other less expensive polls that often fill the space. But Dana is far too nice to ever say that…

Then there are the candidates.

As the great Harry Enten observed last week even when Moore’s advantage seemed to fully reassert his itself, the Republican was hardly safe. Senate polls in the past 20 years have been off by an average about 5 points, and consistently so.

Even if the race hadn’t shifted back in Jones’ favor, a lead in the mid-single digits would not have been enough to put him out of reach – especially in an oddball race like this one.

The point here is that Moore was not a very good nominee even before Nov. 9, the start of the deluge of accusations of misconduct with teenaged girls while he was a prosecuting attorney.

Moore and Jones were tied in the Fox News poll taken in mid-October. You would have had to give Moore the edge given the general political proclivities of the state and the huge number of undecided voters.

But even so, a tie in a state where Republican statewide candidates win by 30 points or so? That’s some weak tea right there.

If you will recall, though, the argument was that the things that made Moore a weaker general election candidate than incumbent Luther Strange – Moore’s bellicosity and embrace of outré views on sodomy laws, etc. – were the very things that Moore’s backers said were the most needed in Washington.

Steve Bannon and his crew argued, in essence, that Alabama Republicans could take a chance on Moore because, well, it was Alabama, a place where a Republican can underperform by 15 points and still win in a landslide.

But Moore would prove to be a doubly deficient candidate, and worst of all the claims against him undercut his well-cultivated image as a moral authority. If you were skeptical of Moore’s views or attitude, you might have taken solace in the idea that he was bound by a strict code.

That he was accused of abusing his position to seek out children was devastating. That he so badly mangled the response – first offering flimsyish denials before reversing himself and offering a blanket denial and scorn for the accusers – made it worse.

You can imagine the though process: Roy Moore the firebrand pistol-packer? Maybe. Roy Moore the charlatan? No way.



The other thing Bannon didn’t account for was that the Democrats would have a vote in this too. Jones has run well – positioning himself as a means by which for Alabamians to avoid disgrace, a caretaker for two years.

By the time popular, longtime Sen. Richard Shelby announced Sunday that he had not voted for Moore, it amounted to a tacit endorsement of a Jones win. Jones dove on the ball at once and offered himself up as a Senator in the mold of Shelby, who though now Republican, was first elected as a moderate Democrat in 1986.



The ingredients behind a potential Jones win are the following: a weak Republican nominee, a huge scandal, a highly energized Democratic electorate and a competent Democratic nominee.

Jones needs those irregular, largely African-American voters to actually show up and for the pangs of conscience that have been stabbing Alabama Republicans – is it more morally dubious to vote for an accused creep or a pro-choice Democrat? – don’t stab more sharply against Jones Tuesday in the voting booth.

OBAMA, BIDEN CONTRIBUTE TO ALA. RACE WITH ROBO-CALLS

Fox News: “Former President Barack Obama and his veep Joe Biden have recorded robo-calls in support of Democratic Alabama Senate candidate Doug Jones, in a final push to get out the vote ahead of Tuesday’s special election. A Jones campaign official confirmed the calls to Fox News. They started going out statewide on Monday. The 11th-hour efforts are being undertaken on both sides. President Trump – who held a rally Friday just across the Alabama state line in Florida where he touted Republican Roy Moore’s candidacy – has also recorded a pro-Moore robo-call. The national interest reflects the importance to Trump's agenda of keeping the seat in Republican hands.”

Trump records robo-call to boost Moore - Reuters: “President Donald Trump sought to boost Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore by releasing a recorded phone call on his behalf in the final stretch of a bitter Alabama election fight marked by accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore. Moore, 70, a conservative Christian and former Alabama Supreme Court justice, will face off in Tuesday’s election against Democrat Doug Jones, 63, a former U.S. attorney. On Monday, the eve of the election, the Moore campaign is rolling out a ‘robo-call’ with Trump’s voice telling voters that if they do not support the Republican candidate, progress on his agenda will be ‘stopped cold.’”

Jones is utilizing Shelby’s sentiments - The Hill: “Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones will use excerpts of Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) saying he cannot support Republican candidate Roy Moore as part of a new robocall ahead of Tuesday's special election in Alabama, CNN reported on Sunday. On Sunday morning, Shelby told host Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he did not vote for Moore over concerns about the allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against Moore. The robocall, expected to be aired statewide on Monday, will take advantage of the Republican senator's remarks, according to CNN. Jones's campaign is already utilizing excerpts from Shelby's critical comments in two 15-second digital advertisements.”

Moore says it’s him versus the GOP establishment - The Hill: “GOP candidate Roy Moore on Sunday said he is fighting against both the Republican establishment and the Democratic Party, claiming that both groups want his Democratic rival to win in Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama. Moore said in an interview on Breitbart journalist Aaron Klein's radio show that the Republican establishment wants Democratic candidate Doug Jones to win the election because they think he would be easy to defeat in the next Senate race.”

Uhhh where are ya Moore? - Politico: “In the last weekend of Alabama’s wild special Senate election, Doug Jones barnstormed the state with A-list Democrats in a bid to turn out black voters he desperately needs to win in the deep-red state. Republican Roy Moore disappeared. … Two Republicans briefed on Moore’s schedule before this weekend said he intended to spend Saturday in Philadelphia at the Army-Navy football game… One of those Republicans, who expressed concern about Moore’s absence, said that the planned trip was discussed with Moore’s campaign within the last few weeks and the candidate determined to go — case closed.”

But Simpson is not normal, and life is often better to some people than they feel they deserve. ... It’s there in how seriously he takes the job of making music providing ‘maybe 20 minutes of distraction in a person’s life.’”

SCOREBOARD

Trump net job-approval rating: -23.6 points

Change from one week ago: down 4 points

[President Trump’s score is determined by subtracting his average job disapproval rating in the five most recent, methodologically sound public polls from his average approval rating, calculated in the same fashion.]

TRUMP ACCUSERS TO UNITE, SEEK HILL PROBE

The Hill: “Women who have publicly accused President Trump of sexual misconduct will call for Congress to investigate the allegations at a press conference on Monday. The women will unite for the first time to demand the probe and share details of their allegations against Trump, according to a press release. The conference is being hosted by Brave New Films, a film and campaigns organization that works for progressive causes. It released a film about the allegations against Trump in November. More than a dozen women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump during his presidential campaign. Trump has denied the reports, and the White House has said its official position is that the women are lying. Sexual misconduct has emerged as a major topic in recent weeks as prominent men in politics and entertainment have been accused of sexual harassment or abuse.”

Haley: Accusers ‘should be heard’ - NYT: “Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that women who have accused President Trump of sexual misconduct ‘should be heard,’ a surprising break from the administration’s longstanding assertion that the allegations are false and that voters rightly dismissed them when they elected Mr. Trump. Ms. Haley, a former governor and one of the highest-ranking women in Mr. Trump’s administration, refocused attention on the allegations against the president by insisting that his accusers should be treated no differently than the scores of women who have come forward in recent weeks with stories of sexual harassment and misconduct against other men. ‘They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,’ Ms. Haley said on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation.’”

Gillibrand calls for Trump’s resignation over allegations - CNN: “Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told CNN on Monday that President Donald Trump should resign over allegations of sexual misconduct. ‘President Trump should resign,’ Gillibrand told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview. ‘These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I've heard these women's testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.’ If he does not ‘immediately resign,’ she said, Congress ‘should have appropriate investigations of his behavior and hold him accountable.’ Responding to UN Ambassador Nikki Haley saying that Trump's accusers ‘should be heard,’ Gillibrand said: ‘Not only should women be heard, but they should be believed.’

Farenthold a marked man - Houston Chronicle: “In the last two weeks, five Republicans have qualified to challenge U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Corpus Christi, for re-election. Four of those five candidates have filed since Monday… The latest candidate to jump in the race is Bech Bruun, the former chairman of the Texas Water Development Board who is from Corpus Christ but lives in Austin. Bruun officially qualifed for the 27th Congressional District primary on Friday morning. Earlier this week Republicans Jerry Hall, Eddie Gassman and Christopher K. Mapp all qualified for the primary as well. And a week earlier, former Victoria County Republican Party chairman Michael Cloud qualified for the March 6 primary. … Democrats Raul (Roy) Barrera of Corpus Christi and Ronnie McDonald of Bastrop will be in a March 6 Democratic primary.”

Ryan looks to stay ahead of scandals - WashEx: “Speaker Paul Ryan is under mounting strain as the rising number of sexual misconduct allegations has forced the Wisconsin Republican to assume the role of House warden. Former Reps. Trent Franks of Arizona and Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania are unlikely to be the last House Republicans Ryan is compelled to push out of Congress because of sexual misconduct. Congressional ethics probes and media investigations are expected to unearth more incidents of harassment, or worse. Ryan has embraced the task. He’s disgusted with the alleged malfeasance and concerned for female staff — those already affected and those who could be, absent changes in workplace culture. But it’s also trying, as Ryan in some instances confronts longtime friends and respected colleagues about the sordid details of their abhorrent behavior and demands resignations.”

Pawlenty eyes run for Franken’s Senate seat - Twin Cities Pioneer Press: “Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty says he’s considering running for Sen. Al Franken’s U.S. Senate seat. The Republican governor and onetime presidential candidate insisted Friday that he’s still ‘politically retired.’ But Pawlenty would be a prized recruit in 2018 for Republicans hoping to capitalize on Franken’s resignation amid a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. Pawlenty became the last Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota when he won his second term in 2006. And he considered running for Senate before he decided to run for governor. Franken’s resignation has forced him and others to think about how to improve the state and nation, he said. He spoke after addressing a local Chamber of Commerce event.”



Conyers resignation ignites family squabble - WaPo: “That field may or may not include [John Conyers’s] son [John Conyers III]; he’s yet to declare his candidacy and has been slammed with news of an arrest connected to an alleged domestic assault earlier this year in Los Angeles. But even before Conyers’s announcement on [Mildred Gaddis’s] program Tuesday, another relative — state Sen. Ian Conyers, the congressman’s 29-year-old great-nephew — announced his own candidacy. And state Sen. Coleman Young II, son of Detroit’s first black mayor but fresh off being clobbered by incumbent Mayor Mike Duggan last month, declared his bid Friday.”

DEMS LOOK TO EASE DIVISIONS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS

WaPo: “In recent weeks, Democrats have scored huge electoral wins in Virginia, cultivated public opposition to the Republican tax plan, purged two liberal stars accused of sexual misconduct and gotten closer to winning a Senate race in Alabama that should be out of reach in such a conservative state. But they still can’t agree on what the party stands for. From immigration to banking reform to taxes to sexual harassment, many in the party say it does not have a unified message to spread around the country. Those concerns flared up at a party meeting over the weekend in Washington. … But pulling those advantages into a coherent message remains elusive in Trump’s tweet-driven Washington. Instead, Democrats are continuing to argue among themselves over how to present themselves to voters. In addition, the bitterness cultivated during the party’s 2016 presidential nominating contest has not fully faded.”

DNC discuss cutting amount of superdelegates - Politico: “A commission set up to help reform the Democratic presidential nominating process has voted to restrict the number of superdelegates as part of a slew of changes. The Democratic Party’s Unity Reform Commission is recommending cutting the number of superdelegates by about 400, equal to a 60 percent reduction. Many of the remaining superdelegates would see their vote tied to the results in their state. The commission is also suggesting that absentee voting be required as an option for presidential caucus participants. It is calling for automatic voter registration and same-day voter registration. And it wants to mandate public reporting of raw vote totals from caucus states. The recommendations will now go to the Democratic National Committee’s rules and bylaws committee, and then likely to the full 447-member Democratic National Committee…”

Tennesseans change their tune on Bredesen - National Journal: “A dozen years ago, liberals denounced Phil Bredesen, the then-Democratic governor of Tennessee, for his decision to kick off about 170,000 adults from the state’s expanded Medicaid program in order to fix a budget crisis. … Now, Democrats have turned to Bredesen, a 74-year old white, moderate man for their political salvation, even as many of them wish for a future of ever greater progressive policies on the backs of increasingly diverse younger generations. But officials and strategists from Tennessee to D.C. say Bredesen is the Democrats’ best shot to win the open Senate seat, giving them a slim chance to take back the Senate in 2018. The argument: He’s the last Democrat to win statewide, and he’s the only one left who can do it again—though he’s unlikely to spend much time highlighting that fact.”



SCRAMBLE TO CORRECT ERRORS OF HASTE IN TAX PLAN

WaPo: “Republicans are moving their tax plan toward final passage at stunning speed, blowing past Democrats before they’ve had time to fully mobilize against it but leaving the measure vulnerable to the types of expensive problems popping up in their massive and complex plan. Questionable special-interest provisions have been stuffed in along the way, out of public view and in some cases literally in the dead of night. Drafting errors by exhausted staff are cropping up and need fixes, which must be tackled by congressional negotiators working to reconcile competing versions of the legislation passed separately by the House and the Senate. And the melding process underway has opened the door to another frenzy of 11th-hour lobbying as special interests, including President Trump’s rich friends, make one last dash for cash before the final bill speeds through both chambers of Congress and onto Trump’s desk. Passage is expected the week before Christmas.”

Oops: Bill would tax top earners at 100 percent - WSJ: “Some high-income business owners could face marginal tax rates exceeding 100% under the Senate’s tax bill, far beyond the listed rates in the Republican plan. That means a business owner’s next $100 in earnings, under certain circumstances, would require paying more than $100 in additional federal and state taxes.”

Trump to make closing argument this week - Axios: “On Wednesday, President Trump will deliver his closing argument on tax reform to an audience made up largely of young people and middle-class families whose personal stories will be laced into his remarks. Trump's remarks at the Treasury Department, next door to the White House, are expected to lay out how the once-in-a-generation tax cut/reform bill will create economic opportunity and brighter futures. Aides say Trump will display his deal making/closing skills as he makes his case to the American people, while continuing to work behind the scenes to iron out final details. A source close to the White House told me: ‘There's no way we would have been here had he not pushed for this to happen before Christmas.’""

The democrat candidates currently highlighted, even excluding Bernie Sanders, seem focused in that direction (Warner, Harris). Also, polling within the younger generations indicates that they are receptive, and even may prefer, socialism. Additionally, the recent Soros sponsored event in California indicated that he would like to see the entire country go further in the direction of California, which in my opinion is towards socialism. It surprises me since our government (particularly the Senate) is showing that they really aren’t very good at anything in the current environment, why would we want to give them more control? What are your thoughts? Do you see us heading there, or avoiding that treacherous path?” – Leslie Rice, Hillsboro, N.H.



[Ed. note: Well, when you put it that way… Maybe it will be helpful to think of it like this: Politics is always a struggle between youth and maturity. It’s one of the basic dividing points for everything else we do and, historically, young voters tend to push for change, while older voters seek to hold the line. A funny thing happens to those young voters, though… They turn into old voters. Just as Baby Boomers went from burning draft cards in the 1960’s to lighting up Wall Street IPOs in the 1990s, time and tide change us all. I think the more fundamental concern I have is whether we can preserve some political norms in near term so that whatever does come next has to operate within some guardrails. The degree to which governing and political norms have been upended in the past 25 years is a big deal. My hope is that there will be pendular swing toward normalcy and decency. But that only happens if voters demand it.]



“I enjoy Halftime Reports, but I was surprised that neither you nor any other reporter picked up or commented on what Senate Leader McConnell said to President Trump in yesterday’s meeting, re the spending bill. Mitch said he looked forward to extending the CR to be able to work a long-term solution. Only in Congress is a six-to-nine month spending bill considered a long-term solution, especially when it is already three months late. None of the media is addressing the deleterious effects to the military and other federal agencies of operating on CR’s each year. At a time when our military needs to recapitalize, a CR impedes the ability to do that. When Congress finally passes the spending bill and all the attendant authority associated with it, the military will not have the time to spend it appropriately before the end of the fiscal year. The good news though, is that Congress will be the first to criticize the military for any rushed or inappropriate expenditures.” – David Jowers, Littleton, Mass.



[Ed. note: I think that was more a question of timing than disinterest! In fact, we talk so much and so often about the perils of fiscal improbity that I worry readers will become bored. It has now been a decade since we’ve really had anything like ordinary budgeting. Unlike many who think that the 60-vote threshold on legislation is causing Senate dysfunction, I see another culprit: The Byrd rule and budget reconciliation. The arrangement was supposed to make budgeting easier and more ordinary. But since it has become the preferred vehicle to advance partisan policy objectives that budgetary function has been substantially lost. As the Senate looks at revamping rules after the next election, I think there’s a strong argument to be made for abolishing reconciliation.]

KDVR: “Every holiday season when Santa comes to town, children and their parents line-up to meet the jolly big man – but one Maryland toddler wasn’t having it. Kerry Spencer taught her son the sign for ‘help’ in sign language. And during his photo with Santa – he made the sign. ‘We taught our baby sign language. This is the sign for ‘help.’ You’re welcome,’ Spencer wrote. Spencer tweeted out the hilarious photo on Tuesday and it has gone viral with over 5,800 retweets and over 22,900 likes, as of Saturday afternoon. She went on to clear up the specific sign language variant he was taught. ‘In baby sign you go with what they do. We showed him the ASL version and this is what he did,’ she wrote on Twitter. No word on if the little boy was able to let Saint Nick know what he wanted for Christmas before his parents rescued him.”

BURGER KING MANAGER FILMED SCREAMING AT CUSTOMER FOR TAKING TOO LONG TO ORDER

According to reports, the 34-year-old Bradley S. Galloway told officers his name was “Burger King,” and he smelled like alcohol. Officers noted Galloway’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, WGIL reported.

Galloway failed to cooperate with officers or medical personnel, and refused medical assitance. During an inspection by the EMTs, Galloway made racial slurs towards the paramedics multiple times.

The man then refused to stand up by himself and required police to carry him into the police station.

Galloway continued to make “several unusual comments, including ‘Donald Trump is coming to beat up’” the officers, The Register-Mail reported.

Eventually, he was transported to the hospital, where he implied that a doctor was coming to give him a million dollars. When he was transferred back to the county jail, Galloway told officers, “You all believe in Satan. You all worship Satan. You all driving me to Satan’s town,” WGIL reported.

“Unless Don Lemon is a LOT younger than he appears to be, this is a tone-deaf overreach.","CNN has accused President Trump of bullying Don Lemon in a tweet that called the polarizing anchor the “dumbest man on television.”

Trump slammed The New York Times on Monday morning over what he called a “false” story claiming he watches up to eight hours of television a day – while taking yet another swipe at CNN and MSNBC. The Times article detailed Trump’s “hour-by-hour battle for self-preservation,” describing how he sometimes “hate-watches” CNN’s Lemon.

“Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

CNN quickly issued a statement, accusing Trump of bullying the 51-year-old anchor.

“In a world where bullies torment kids on social media to devastating effect on a regular basis with insults and name calling, it is sad to see our president engaging in the very same behavior himself. Leaders should lead by example,” CNN said.

Former CNN political analyst Jeff Greenfield isn’t a fan of CNN’s statement and mocked his old network.

“Unless Don Lemon is a LOT younger than he appears to be, this is a tone-deaf overreach. From what I've seen, Lemon--unlike bullied kids whose school officials ignore the issue--is more than capable of standing up for himself. This almost infantilizes him,” he tweeted.

Fox News contributor Stephen Miller joked, “CNN just compared themselves to a crying kid in a car and they think that's the high road.”

President Trump has an ongoing feud with CNN, which has essentially implemented an anti-Trump programming strategy. As a result, the president often refers to CNN as “fake news” and the network has launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to shake that moniker with a “Facts First” initiative.

CNN had to issue an embarrassing correction on Friday when the Washington Post debunked the network's report claiming the Trump campaign had early, secret access to hacked DNC emails from WikiLeaks. The network on Friday inaccurately trumpeted that Congressional investigators obtained a mysterious 2016 email that was sent to Trump and other top aides, including Donald Trump Jr., which contained information on how to get a sneak peek at hacked information that WikiLeaks had acquired. The email, as CNN reported, offered a “decryption key” to access the files – but the network botched the date on the email, rendering the entire report irrelevant.

Democrat Jones spoke first during a ""Get-Out-the-Vote Rally"" in Birmingham. Jones, who led Moore by 10 points in a recent Fox News poll, said that now is the time to make a choice. “It’s now time,” Jones said to a cheering crowd. “The hay’s in the barn. All we got to do is get our votes tomorrow. Take people with you to the polls. This election is going to be one of the most significant in our state’s history in a long time.”

Moore spoke later in the night at a ""Drain the Swamp"" rally in Midland City. He was bolstered by support from a wide array of local figures and prominent conservatives including former White House chief strategist and Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon and, earlier in the evening, by Sheriff David Clarke.

Jones and Moore are vying for the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions' move to become Attorney General earlier this year.

Flanked by his family on one side and actress Alyssa Milano and basketball legend Charles Barkley on the other, Jones remained hopeful and generally steered away from the series of sexual misconduct allegations that have swirled around Moore.

“I have heard so much, especially in the last couple of weeks,” he said. “It is time, and I think we are going to see it tomorrow, that the majority of Alabama people put our decency, our state, before a political party. I think it’s time to say no more to treating people like second class citizens. It’s just time, folks, that we say no more.

“This race is really not about Roy Moore. It’s not about Doug Jones. This election is what we are as a people in the state of Alabama,” Jones continued. “We are on the right side of history, folks. Please help us get across the finish line. Get your folks to the polls. We’re going to do this. Thank you all.”

Prior to Moore taking the microphone his wife, Kayla, addressed a series of accusations against the Senate candidate, including those that said Moore was anti-Jewish and anti-Black. The narrative, Kayla argued, was an inaccurate one perpetrated by the media.

“One of our attorneys is a Jew,” she said. “Fake news! They are the ones who are embarrassing and they should be ashamed for getting involved in this election for our opponent.”

When Moore finally reached the podium, he was largely subdued, discussing what he alleged was the country’s lost focus on God and the subsequent repercussions.

“We started to forget God and where our strength came from,” Moore said. “We have forgotten that faith upon which we are founded. My opposition has always been about my acknowledgment of God.”

Speaking about the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Moore admitted that the race “has been strange.”

“This race has been very odd,” Moore continued. “We’ve had two presidents, and one candidate for president, who didn’t make it, thank God, do robocalls in this state. We talk about draining the swamp…it’s difficult to drain the swamp when you’re up to your neck in alligators. And that’s where we are, up to our neck in alligators.”

He labeled the initial Washington Post piece detailing the allegations against him a “terrible, disgusting article,” questioning why “these women had not come forward for 40 years but they came forward 30 days before the election.”

Emphasizing “duty, honor and country” to cheers of “Moore, Moore, Moore,” the candidate thanked his supporters ahead of Election Day.

“The North Korean regime's system of guilt-by-association,” she said, “allows for up to three generations of family members to be imprisoned along with the accused.”","United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley held a meeting on the human rights situation in North Korea where one defector spoke about how she was forced to have an abortion following her repatriation from China.

The woman, Ji Hyeon-A, describes a harrowing scene of prison dogs eating dead bodies at her prison camp. She pleaded for the world to act.

The event was titled “The Terrifying experience of forcibly Repatriated North Korean women,” and was sponsored by the U.S. France, Japan, South Korea, Canada and the U.K.

Ji Hyeon-A was repatriated three times to North Korea after she was caught in China. She finally escaped to South Korea and spoke of her horrifying experiences.

She described how North Korean women who got pregnant in China were forced to have abortions.

“Pregnant women were forced into harsh labor all day,” she said. “At night, we heard pregnant mothers screaming and babies died without ever being able to see their mothers.”

North Korea does not allow for mixed-race babies, she said. At one detention center, she described how inmates starved to death. Their dead bodies, she said, were given to the guard dogs for food.

The third time Ji Hyeon-A got caught and sent back to North Korea she was three months pregnant. She tearfully described how she was forced to have an abortion without medication at a local police station.

“My first child passed away without ever seeing the world,” she said, “without any time for me to apologize.”

She finally reached South Korea in 2007 and has since been reunited with her mother, brother and her younger sister. She still has not heard news of her father.

Ji-Hyeon-A said that the North Korean soldier who recently escaped to South Korea “represents a dash toward freedom which is a dream of 25 million North Koreans.”

She said North Korea was “a terrifying prison and the Kim’s are carrying out a vast massacre and it takes a miracle to survive there.”

She criticized the Chinese government for sending North Koreans back to the regime, and urged the Chinese government to stop repatriating people back to the Hermit Kingdom, saying they know what will happen to them when they get there.

Ji-Hyeon-A urged the U.N. and world leaders to fight for North Korean defectors and especially those who are repatriated.

She recited a poem called “Is anyone there?” from a collection of poems she wrote.

“I am scared, is anyone there? I’m here in hell, is anyone there? I scream and yell but no one opens the door. Is anyone there? Please listen to our moans and listen to our pain. Is anyone there? People are dying, my friend is dying. I call out again and again but why don’t you answer. Is anyone there?

Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations, Matthew Rycroft, praised Ji-Hyeon-A for speaking at the event, and said the crimes discussed, which included, “forced abortions, summary executions, hard labor, rape: those are conditions that amount to crimes against humanity,” he said.

Earlier in the day China had tried to stop a Security Council meeting convened by Japan on the human rights situation in North Korea. China only had the support of Russia and Bolivia and failed in its attempt to stop it from moving forward.

At the Security Council meeting, Haley said the full story of the North Korean people needed to be told.

“The regime is using that power to develop an unnecessary arsenal and support enormous conventional military forces that pose a grave risk to international peace and security,” she said. “Their menacing march towards nuclear weapons begins with the oppression and exploitation of ordinary North Korean people.”

Haley said the situation was made possible “through the export of workers abroad to earn hard currency and the use of forced labor at home, the regime uses its people to underwrite its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.”

She said the Kim regime has imprisoned an estimated 100,000 people.

""This is one of my nightmares, right: a terrorist attack in the subway system,"" Cuomo, a Democrat, later told cable channel NY1.","A would-be suicide bomber inspired by Islamic State extremists strapped on a crude pipe bomb, slipped unnoticed into the nation's busiest subway system and set the device off at rush hour Monday in a scenario that New York has dreaded for years, authorities said.

In the end, the only serious wounds were to the suspect identified as Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant and former cab driver. But the attack sent terrified commuters fleeing through a smoky passageway, and three people suffered headaches and ringing ears from the first bomb blast in the subway in more than two decades.

""This was an attempted terrorist attack,"" Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve his ultimate goals.""

The suspect had looked as Islamic State propaganda online and told investigators he acted alone in retaliation for U.S. military aggression, law enforcement officials said.

In Washington, President Donald Trump said the explosion highlighted the need to change immigration policies, including the type of family-based visa Ullah obtained to come to the U.S. in 2011. Such visas are ""incompatible with national security,"" the Republican president said in a statement.

""America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,"" said Trump, who campaigned on cracking down on immigration.

The attack near Times Square came less than two months after eight people died near the World Trade Center in a truck attack authorities said was carried out by an Uzbek immigrant who admired the Islamic State group.

Law enforcement officials said Ullah was inspired by IS but apparently did not have any direct contact with the group. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said there was no evidence, so far, of other bombs or a larger plot. He said officials were exploring whether Ullah had been on authorities' radar, but there was no indication yet that he was.

Cuomo said there was reason to believe the attacker looked at bomb-making instructions online.

Investigators described the bomb as a low-tech explosive device attached to Ullah with ""Velcro and plastic ties."" It was ignited with a Christmas light, matches and a nine-volt battery. The short pipe was packed with explosive powder but did not work as intended. It was not powerful enough to turn the pipe into deadly shrapnel, the officials said.

Investigators said the suspect was seen on surveillance footage putting the circuits together with his hands and igniting the bomb.

Some of the bomb-making materials may have been bought commercially. The pipe may have been obtained from his job where he worked as an electrician, one official said.

Authorities were searching Ullah's Brooklyn home and a nearby rented space, interviewing witnesses and relatives, reviewing his subway fare card and looking for surveillance footage that might show his movements in the moments before the 7:20 a.m. attack.

Security cameras captured the attacker walking casually through a crowded passageway under 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues when the bomb went off amid a plume of white smoke, which cleared to show the man sprawled on the ground and commuters scattering.

""All we could hear was the chaos,"" said Elrana Peralta, a Greyhound customer-service worker who was working at the Port Authority bus terminal near the blast, though she did not hear it. Instead, she heard people yelling, ""Get out! Get out! Get out!""

Port Authority police said officers found the man injured on the ground, with wires protruding from his jacket to his pants and the device strapped to his torso under his coat. They said he was reaching for a cellphone and they grabbed his hands.

A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with his shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering his bare midriff.

Law enforcement officials said the suspect was speaking with investigators from the hospital bed where he was being treated for burns to his hands and abdomen.

He was ""all over the place"" on the question of motive, but indicated he wanted to avenge U.S. aggression against the Islamic State, one official said.

The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.

Ullah came to the U.S. on an F-4 visa, available for those with family in the U.S. who are citizens, the Department of Homeland Security said. Trump's administration has called for a ""merit-based"" immigration system that would limit family-based green cards to spouses and minor children. A White House spokeswoman said Monday that the proposed policy would have kept Ullah out of the U.S.

He had been licensed to drive a livery cab between 2012 and 2015, but the license was allowed to lapse, according to law enforcement officials and New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission. He had been in two car accidents during his time driving, one law enforcement official said.

Ullah lived with his father, mother and brother in a Brooklyn neighborhood with a large Bangladeshi community, residents said. The family's red, two-story brick home is just off a shopping strip.

A statement on behalf of the family sent by the New York Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the attack but also ""outraged by the way we have been targeted by law enforcement, including a teenage relative of the suspect who was pulled from class and questioned in his school without a parent guardian or attorney.""

News of Ullah's arrest stunned Alan Butrico, who owns the house next door and a locksmith business two doors down.

""It's very weird,"" Butrico said. ""You never know who your neighbors are.""

The last bomb to go off in the subway system was believed to be in December 1994, when an explosive made from mayonnaise jars and batteries wounded 48 people in a car in lower Manhattan.

The Times Square subway station is the city's busiest, with 64 million riders passing through every year. The subway system as a whole carried over 1.7 billion people last year.

Monday's explosion triggered a massive emergency response both above and below ground, halting what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour at the ""Crossroads of the World."" But streets quickly began returning to normal.

""This is one of my nightmares, right: a terrorist attack in the subway system,"" Cuomo, a Democrat, later told cable channel NY1.

""The good news is: We were on top of it,"" he said, and ""the reality was not as bad as the fear.""

7:30 p.m.

The family of a man accused of setting off a pipe bomb in a crowded New York City subway corridor says it's heartbroken and deeply saddened by the suffering the attack has caused.

In a statement, Akayed Ullah's family also says it's outraged by the way it was targeted by law enforcement, including pulling a teenage relative from class and questioning him without a parent, guardian or attorney present. The family says it expects more from the justice system.

The statement was released on behalf of the family by Albert Fox Cahn, legal director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in New York.

Ullah, an immigrant from Bangladesh, was the only person seriously injured in the blast during the Monday morning rush hour that sent commuters scurrying in panic.

6:15 p.m.

Law enforcement officials say a pipe bomb that exploded in a crowded New York City subway passageway was ignited with a Christmas light, matches and a nine-volt battery.

The officials say the short pipe was packed with explosive powder but didn't work as intended. The blast wasn't powerful enough to turn the pipe into deadly shrapnel.

Authorities have identified the attacker as Akayed Ullah, an immigrant from Bangladesh.

Law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation say he had looked at Islamic State group propaganda online and told investigators he was retaliating against U.S. military aggression.

The blast during the Monday morning rush hour injured three people besides Ullah, who's being treated at a hospital.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the blast.

President Donald Trump says a bomb blast in Manhattan highlights the need for an immigration overhaul.

Trump said Monday that the U.S. ""must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people"" into the country.

The Republican president points to his controversial travel ban as an example of the kind of policy that needs to be put in place. And he's calling on Congress to end ""chain migration,"" in which family members are permitted to join relatives who have immigrated.

He also says people convicted of terror acts ""deserve the strongest penalty allowed by law, including the death penalty in appropriate cases.""

The only person seriously wounded Monday was the suspected bomber.

4:45 p.m.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions says a pipe bomb explosion in New York City's subway system and an earlier attack in Manhattan highlight the nation's ""failed immigration policies.""

Sessions says the Monday blast shows the need for immigration reform. Authorities say a man who came to the U.S. from Bangladesh seven years ago set off a pipe bomb strapped to his body in a subway corridor near Times Square. He was injured along with three others.

Sessions says relatives of U.S. citizens shouldn't get priority ahead of ""someone who is high-skilled, well educated, has learned English, and is likely to assimilate and flourish here.""

He says a merit-based immigration system would be safer.

His comments are similar to those made by a White House spokeswoman.

A White House spokeswoman says a pipe bomb explosion in New York City's subway system shows the need for ""immigration reform.""

Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Congress should work with the president, stressing the need to ""protect our borders"" and calling for a ""merit-based"" immigration system.

Authorities say a man inspired by the Islamic State group set off a pipe bomb strapped to his body in a subway corridor near Times Square, injuring himself and wounding three others.

The suspect in a pipe bomb explosion in New York City's subway system at one point had a license to drive livery cars and for-hire vehicles.

Authorities have identified the attacker as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah. The blast in an underground subway corridor during the Monday morning rush hour injured three people, as well as Ullah.

New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission says records show he had a for-hire license from March 2012 through March 2015. It then expired and wasn't renewed. At the time, a for-hire license did not allow someone to drive one of the city's yellow taxis.

The TLC says there are no records to indicate if he actually used the license to work as a car driver.

New York's governor says the suspect in a pipe bomb blast in New York City's subway system may have crafted the device from online instructions, and so far it doesn't appear to be part of a larger plot.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo told cable news channel NY1 that officials ""have reason to believe that this person went to the internet and found out how to make a homemade bomb.""

Authorities identified the attacker as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah. Monday's explosion injured him, slightly wounded three other people and sent commuters fleeing in terror through a subway corridor near Times Square.

Cuomo says he's boosting security at high-profile spots statewide. The Democrat also suggests internet companies need to look at the access potential attackers have to what he calls ""garbage and vileness"" online.

We warn our kids not to talk to strangers, but they also need to know how to avoid inappropriate websites or why an explicit text from a friend could get them in trouble.

FOX's Lisa Brady reports in this week's 'FOX on Family':

Even kids aware of stranger-danger, may not be prepared for what's lurking online:

(Lozano) ""You can be playing a video game and then there'll be something that kind of comes up for pornography and all you have to do is click and you're in a whole 'nother world.""

Licensed professional counselor Rusty Lozano says he and his wife were stunned during recent forums with middle school classes in Texas:

(Lozano) ""When she says how many of you girls have actually experienced a boy asking for a nude picture of you and she said more than half of those girls raised their hands.""

In a separate room, nearly half of the boys reported some kind of a stranger-encounter, like someone trying to coax them into a car.

Lozano urges parents to be proactive; warn kids about sexting and pornography, the laws against it and possible ripple effects, including blackmail:

(Lozano) ""From making a mistake of sending a picture and saying well, if you don't send more, then I'm going to spread this around or I'm going to get you in trouble.""

He recommends age-appropriate warnings for younger kids, too. Because once a child starts using a smart device, they can be a captive audience.

By David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, The Wall Street Journal



Speculation about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has turned toward obstruction of justice—specifically, whether President Trump can be criminally prosecuted for firing James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or for earlier asking Mr. Comey to go easy on onetime national security adviser Mike Flynn. The answer is no. The Constitution forbids Congress to criminalize such conduct by a president, and applying existing statutes in such a manner would violate the separation of powers.

The Constitution creates three coequal branches of government, and no branch may exercise its authority in a manner that would negate or fundamentally undercut the power of another. The power to appoint and remove high-level executive-branch officers, such as the FBI director, is a core aspect of the president’s executive authority. It is the principal means by which a president disciplines the exercise of the executive power the Constitution vests in him.

The same is true of Mr. Trump’s request, as purported by Mr. Comey: “I hope you can see your way clear . . . to letting Flynn go.” The FBI director wields core presidential powers when conducting an investigation, and the president is entirely within his rights to inquire about, and to direct, such investigations.

Opioid prescriptions in the U.S. surged by 300 percent from 1991 to 2009 and totaled 246 million by 2015, the researchers write in JAMA Internal Medicine.
The rise in risk of opioid use with another user in the household was small across all age groups.
One drawback of the study is that insurance claims don’t shed light on the reasons prescriptions for opioids might run in families.
“This study reinforces the concerns that having more opioid medications in a household may put other family members at risk,” Houck said by email.","When one person in a household gets prescribed opioids, the other people who live with them are more likely to get their own prescriptions for these narcotic painkillers, a U.S. study suggests.

Researchers examined data on about 12.6 million people living in a household where someone was prescribed opioids and 6.4 million individuals in homes where someone was prescribed a different option for pain - nonprescription steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs.

Overall, 11.83 percent of people living with someone prescribed opioids and 11.11 percent of people living with a person prescribed NSAIDs started taking opioids over the next year, the study found.

“We already know that patients often share their prescriptions for opioids with a family member,” said lead study author Marissa Seamans of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. “What we didn’t know is whether family members of opioid users are more likely to fill opioid prescriptions themselves than family members of non-opioid users.”

'ELF ON THE SHELF' UNDERGOES EMERGENCY SURGERY AFTER DOG ATTACK

The increase in absolute risk was small - less than one percentage point.

“But this matters for patients because millions of opioids are prescribed and have harmful effects,” Seamans said by email.

Opioid prescriptions in the U.S. surged by 300 percent from 1991 to 2009 and totaled 246 million by 2015, the researchers write in JAMA Internal Medicine.

To assess how one person’s prescription might influence others in their household, the study team looked at insurance claims from 2000 to 2014 for people who were living together and had the same benefits.

The rise in risk of opioid use with another user in the household was small across all age groups. It was greatest, at 1.26 percentage points, for adults aged 26 to 35 and it was lowest, at 0.41 percentage point, for children 11 or younger.

When the first person prescribed opioids had back or neck pain or a fracture, the risk that another person in their household would get opioids was slightly lower than when the first person didn’t get opioids for these reasons, the study also found.

One drawback of the study is that insurance claims don’t shed light on the reasons prescriptions for opioids might run in families.

“It is possible that this is due to increased rates of chronic pain in people with family members with chronic pain,” said Dr. Chad Brummett, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and co-director of the Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network.

“However, it is also likely that living with an opioid user alters attitudes and beliefs about the risks and benefits of opioid use,” Brummett, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

Even if opioids are used as prescribed, just having these drugs in the house increases the chances that somebody in the household may misuse opioids, said Dr. Julie Gaither, a pediatrics researcher at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut who wasn’t involved in the study.

“Opioids are now available in millions of American homes, which means that everyday individuals vulnerable to addiction and overdose - such as children, teens, the elderly, and those with a history of substance abuse - are routinely exposed to medications that are highly addictive and potentially deadly,” Gaither said by email.

“Simply having more of the medications around increases the risk for accidental poisonings in the young and overdose in teens and adults,” Gaither added.

The study findings add to evidence that opioids should be prescribed in the smallest dose possible for the briefest period of time, said Dr. Constance Houck, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital who wasn’t involved in the study.

“This study reinforces the concerns that having more opioid medications in a household may put other family members at risk,” Houck said by email. “The take home message from this study is that opioids should be used sparingly for the treatment of pain and whenever possible combined with other medications such as NSAIDs and physical modalities such as ice or heat to reduce the amount needed.”",Opioid painkiller prescriptions may run in families,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/12/11/opioid-painkiller-prescriptions-may-run-in-families.html

""This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint,"" he said. ""We will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars, and perhaps someday, to many worlds beyond.""

NASA’s goal is to send a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s.

Chris Carberry, executive director of Explore Mars, a non-profit organization that aims to advance the goal of sending humans to Mars within the next two decades, welcomed the policy directive and urged the administration to drive space exploration over the coming years. “We are certainly happy that Mars remains a key element of US space policy,” to told Fox News, via email. “However, we also hope that a plan can [be] devised that will enable humanity to return to the Moon, but not delay Mars missions by decades.”

Explore Mars, he explained, is a strong proponent of building strong commercial and international partnerships to enable lunar missions, while at the same time, allowing the U.S. to lead missions to Mars in the 2030s. “We hope that this signing will help to accelerate our return to deep space exploration.”

Under the directive, the government is expected to work closely with other nations and private industry.

The last time a human set foot on the Moon was during the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972. Only 12 men, all Americans, have set foot on the Moon.

Vice President Mike Pence also highlighted the economic impact of the policy directive Monday. “We will see jobs created that you couldn’t even imagine,” he said, during the White House signing ceremony.

The space policy directive ensures that America will lead in space once again, he added.

Trump and Pence were joined at the White House by several current and former astronauts, including Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, and former U.S. Sen. and Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison ""Jack"" Schmitt, the next-to-last person on the Moon.

Monday marks the 45th anniversary of the Moon landing by Schmitt and Eugene Cernan, the Apollo 17 commander. Cernan, the last man to walk on the Moon, died earlier this year at the age of 82.

Past presidents, including George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, have also proposed returning to the Moon and missions to Mars but budget constraints derailed their plans.

Enter Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is fighting to get the individual AMT removed from the final tax reform bill as well.
No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us.
Keeping the individual AMT means many Americans will see no tax cut under the GOP bill, Burr says.
“I am confident the House and Senate conferees will fix the individual AMT in the final tax reform bill,” he says.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared in the Washington Post.

The phones of House and Senate leaders are ringing off the hook right now, as CEOs and wealthy donors lobby them furiously to lower the top income tax rate and insert costly carve-outs into the GOP tax bill to protect their business tax preferences. Too bad regular taxpayers don’t have a direct line to the conferees hammering out the final bill to plead their cases. Because it seems as though they have been forgotten.

Case in point: At the last minute, Senate Republicans changed their version of the tax bill to keep the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) — a pernicious parallel tax code which they had promised to scrap that requires corporations and millions of individuals to calculate their taxes twice and pay whichever rate is higher. On hearing the news, corporate lobbyists swung into action, pressing GOP leaders to get rid of the corporate AMT in the final bill. And their efforts seem to be paying off. The corporate AMT “has to be eliminated,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on Monday.

But what about individuals? Who is championing AMT repeal for them?

Enter Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is fighting to get the individual AMT removed from the final tax reform bill as well. “Repeal of the individual AMT has been a fundamental element of Republican tax reform campaign promises for years,” he told me. “By leaving the individual AMT in place, we would be punishing hardworking Americans and doing virtually nothing to simplify the tax code.”

Burr is right. Congress created the AMT in 1969 after the Treasury Department reported that 155 high-income filers were using tax breaks to avoid paying any income taxes. In 1970, it affected only 20,000 very high-income taxpayers. But today, the number of people impacted has ballooned to 5.2 million. Most of those who currently pay the AMT are not from the highest-income households for which the tax was intended, but the middle and upper-middle class — folks who have enough money to be a ripe target of revenue raisers, but not enough to have influence on Capitol Hill. They are mostly two-earner households with mortgages to pay, who give to charity and have children. The AMT also hits the families of our fallen warriors. According to Burr, children who receive an annuity from the Uniformed Services Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) can see the AMT eat up as much as 26 percent of their benefit. No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us.

Members of the Trump administration know that the AMT is a horrible tax. In 2006, Kevin Hassett — now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers — called the AMT “an economic abomination”and urged Congress to “erase it from the tax code completely.” Yet instead of erasing it, Republicans are retaining it.

Keeping the individual AMT means many Americans will see no tax cut under the GOP bill, Burr says. It defeats the entire purpose of tax reform. GOP leaders promised to make the tax code simpler and fairer. But the AMT increases tax complexity and raises compliance costs for 10 million American taxpayers, who must calculate their taxes using two separate systems every year — and then pay whichever rate is the highest. That is not simple or fair. It is obscene.

GOP leaders are focused on passing corporate tax cuts to fuel economic growth, which is a good thing. But they seem to have lost sight of the fact that reducing taxes for individuals is important, too. According to the Tax Policy Center, even before the AMT retention, 1 in 4 Americans will not get any tax cut under the Senate bill, and 14 percent of middle-class Americans will get a tax increase of $1,170. That is a problem for the GOP. If Americans see the GOP borrowing $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts, and they end up getting either no tax cut or paying more next year, they will punish Republicans at the polls. Instead of more carve-outs for corporations and fat-cat donors, Republicans should give tax relief to more individuals, especially the middle class.

Will Burr vote no on final passage if the individual AMT is not repealed? He hopes it won’t come to that. “I am confident the House and Senate conferees will fix the individual AMT in the final tax reform bill,” he says. Let’s hope he’s right. If Republicans get rid of the AMT for corporations, but not for individuals, that will send a clear message to American voters about where the GOP’s interests lie.",Marc Thiessen: Republicans know the AMT is an 'abomination.'

Middle schooler Keaton Jones' video revealing his torment from being bullied at school went viral over the weekend. Celebrities including Chris Evans, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Gal Gadot took up his anti-bullying message, sharing the video with their huge social media followings.

Sometime during the massive outpouring of support -- the video has been viewed over 15 million times -- his mom, Kimberly Jones, set up a PayPal account where people could donate money, causing some to question her motives.

One public figure, Joe Schilling, a Bellator MMA fighter, who was touched by the young boy's heartbreaking story, reached out to Jones to invite Keaton to a show. He said he was surprised by Jones' reaction.

Schilling posted a video on Monday via Instagram with the caption, ""Go look at her ig watch her story posts she just running a money scam. Really really sad and disgusting.

She just wants me to share her GoFund me account.""

Schilling said he asked Kimberly Jones during their conversation what the GoFund me account was for to which he claimed she said, ""You know Christmas is coming and I'm a single mother, blah, blah, money's tight.""

The GoFundMe account in Keaton's name has over $58,000 in donations.

But Jones is fighting back against Schilling's claims, telling Fox News they are ""untrue.""

""I did not tell him that I would rather have donations instead of the help from celebrities,"" Jones said in an Instagram direct message.

Fox News reached out to Schilling but did not receive comment.

Jones is also under fire for some alleged posts on a personal Facebook page that has since been set to private. The mom of three is pictured posing with a Confederate flag in one snap, and another picture shows her son holding an American flag while another child holds the Confederate flag.

""I've taken that down for a reason,"" Jones told Fox News of her Facebook page, without revealing what that reason is.

Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr’s duties – including whether she worked on the dossier – remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects. HPSCI staff confirmed to Fox News that she was paid by Fusion GPS through the summer and fall of 2016.

Fusion GPS has attracted scrutiny because Republican lawmakers have spent the better part of this year investigating whether the dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, served as the basis for the Justice Department and the FBI to obtain FISA surveillance last year on a Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page.

“The House Intelligence Committee,” Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News in a statement on Monday, “is looking into all facets of the connections between the Department of Justice and Fusion GPS, including Mr. Ohr.”

Until Dec. 6, when Fox News began making inquiries about him, Bruce Ohr held two titles at DOJ. He was, and remains, director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force; but his other job was far more senior. Mr. Ohr held the rank of associate deputy attorney general, a post that gave him an office four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The day before Fox News reported that Mr. Ohr held his secret meetings last year with the founder of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled the dossier, the Justice Department stripped Ohr of his deputy title and ousted him from his fourth floor office at the building that DOJ insiders call “Main Justice.”

The Department of Justice has provided no public explanation for Ohr’s demotion. Officials inside the Department have told Fox News his wearing of two hats was “unusual,” but also confirm Ohr had withheld his contacts with the Fusion GPS men from colleagues at the DOJ.

Former FBI Director James Comey has described the dossier as a compendium of “salacious and unverified” allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump and his associates, including Page, a foreign policy adviser. The dossier was provided to the FBI in July 2016, shortly before then-candidate Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination. As Comey later testified, it was in that same month that the FBI began a counterintelligence probe of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

The disclosure by Fox News that Bruce Ohr met with Simpson and Steele last year expanded the reach of the dossier’s creators from the FBI into the top echelons of the Justice Department. Initial investigation suggested that Steele, a longtime FBI informant whose contacts with Mr. Ohr are said to date back a decade, might have played the central role in putting Simpson together with the associate deputy attorney general. Now, the revelation that Mrs. Ohr worked for Simpson calls that account into question.

A review of open source materials shows Mrs. Ohr was described as a Russia expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, when she worked there, briefly, a decade ago. The Center’s website said her project focused on the experiences of Russian farmers during Stalin’s collectivization program and following the invasion of Russia by Nazi forces in 1941. She has also reviewed a number of books about twentieth century Russia, including Reconstructing the State: Personal Networks and Elite Identity in Soviet Russia (2000), by Gerald Easter, a political scientist at Boston College, and Bertrand M. Patenaude’s The Big Show in Bololand: The American Relief Expedition to Soviet Russia in the Famine of 1921 (2002).

Contacted by Fox News late Monday, DOJ officials declined to comment.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, declined to comment on the original disclosure about Mr. Ohr’s secret meetings, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mrs. Ohr.

While Nunes has issued numerous subpoenas to DOJ and FBI relating to the dossier, and has threatened contempt-of-Congress citations against Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray for what congressional Republicans have termed “stonewalling” by the two agencies, Schiff has mostly objected to the demands for documents and witnesses, casting the entire dossier probe as innately political. “I think there's a hope that if they can impeach Christopher Steele, and they can impeach the FBI and DOJ, maybe they can impeach the whole Russia investigation,” Schiff told MSNBC in September.

The president over the summer announced, via Twitter, a ban on transgender servicemembers. But the directive has since been challenged in the courts, and a federal judge last month said the U.S. military must accept them starting Jan. 1.

The new policy reflects growing legal pressure on the issue and the difficult hurdles the federal government would have to cross to enforce Trump's demand.

Potential transgender recruits will still have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that make it possible, though difficult, for them to join the armed services.

Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, says the enlistment of transgender recruits will start Jan. 1 and go on amid the legal battles. The Defense Department also is studying the issue.

Eastburn told The Associated Press on Monday that the new guidelines mean the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. But such recruits are allowed in if a medical provider certifies they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy also must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

Last year, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender service members, allowing them to serve openly in the military. He said that within 12 months -- or by July 2017 -- transgender people also would be able to enlist.

Trump, however, tweeted in July that the federal government ""will not accept or allow"" transgender troops to serve ""in any capacity"" in the military. A month later, he issued a formal order telling the Pentagon to extend the ban. He gave the department six months to determine what to do about those currently serving.

Trump's decision was quickly challenged in court, and two U.S. district court judges have already ruled against the ban. Part of one ruling required the government to allow transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.

""We disagree with the Court's ruling and are seeking to stay the Defense Department's obligations under that ruling as we evaluate next steps. Plaintiffs’ lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons, including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the President ordered, and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam told Fox News.

The government had asked that the Jan. 1 requirement be put on hold while the appeal proceeds. The Pentagon move Monday signals the growing sense within the government that authorities are likely to lose the legal fight.

Christopher Wray was supposed to bring a new candor and credibility to the FBI after the James Comey debacle, but the country is still waiting. The director’s testimony Thursday to the House Judiciary Committee suggests he has joined the Justice Department effort to stop the public from learning about the bureau’s role in the 2016 election.

Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte invited Mr. Wray to answer the multiplying questions about the bureau’s 2016 political interference. This includes the role that the Steele dossier—opposition research financed by the Clinton campaign—played in the FBI’s decision to investigate the Trump presidential campaign. The committee also wants answers about reports that special counsel Robert Mueller demoted Peter Strzok, a lead FBI investigator in both the Trump and Hillary Clinton email investigations, after Mr. Strzok exchanged anti-Trump texts with his mistress, who also works at the FBI.

Mr. Wray spent five hours stonewalling. The director ducked every question about the FBI’s behavior by noting that the Justice Department Inspector General is investigating last year’s events.

Is Mr. Wray concerned that Mr. Strzok edited the FBI’s judgment of Mrs. Clinton’s handling of her emails to “extremely careless” from “grossly negligent” in a previous draft? The grossly negligent phrase might have put Mrs. Clinton in legal jeopardy, but Mr. Wray said he couldn’t answer because that is subject to the “outside, independent investigation.”

Is Mr. Wray taking steps to ensure his top ranks are free of political “taint”? He couldn’t say because of the “outside, independent” investigation.

Ohio Republican Jim Jordan noted that the only way for Congress to know if the FBI used the Steele dossier to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign is for the FBI to provide its application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. “Is there anything prohibiting you from showing this committee [that application]?” Mr. Jordan asked.

Mr. Wray’s answer was dismissive. “I do not believe that I can legally and appropriately share a FISA court submission with this committee,” said Mr. Wray. “When I sign FISA applications, which I have to do almost every day of the week, they are all covered with a ‘classified information’ cover.”",Christopher Wray's FBI Stonewall,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/11/christopher-wrays-fbi-stonewall

Today, he doesn’t have fingerprints and carries scars across his body, a daily reminder of the horrors he endured at Pearl Harbor.","An American hero is finally getting recognition 76 years after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

Ahead of Thursday’s anniversary, the secretary of the U.S. Navy posthumously awarded the Bronze Star with valor to Chief Petty Officer Joe George, who died in 1996. The news comes five months after Fox News interviewed one of five living USS Arizona survivors, Donald Stratton, who urged the Navy to recognize George’s heroic actions that day.

George is credited with saving at least six sailors aboard USS Arizona as it was sinking after being struck several times by Japanese planes during the attack at Pearl Harbor.

Rear Adm. Matthew J. Carter, deputy commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, presented the medal to George's daughter, Joe Ann Taylor, during a ceremony at the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor. Observing the ceremony will be four of the five remaining USS Arizona survivors.

In addition to Chief George's Bronze Star, the navy secretary also awarded the Silver Star Medal to Lt. Aloysious H. Schmitt for his actions at Pearl Harbor while serving on the battleship USS Oklahoma, the Navy said in a statement.

""The presentation of the medals is not only appropriate but simply the right thing to do,"" said Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer. ""One of my highest priorities is to honor the service and sacrifice of our sailors, marines, civilians and family members and it is clear that Lt. Schmitt and Chief George are heroes whose service and sacrifice will stand as an example for current and future service members.""

Donald Stratton and Lauren Bruner, another Arizona survivor, lobbied hard for George to be recognized. Both traveled to Washington, D.C., with Pearl Harbor survivors over the summer to meet President Donald Trump in the White House and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at the Pentagon.

In August, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., introduced a resolution honoring Pearl Harbor hero George for rescuing six injured sailors from the sinking USS Arizona.

The resolution was cosponsored by U.S. Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Mike Lee, R-Utah, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

“Joe George is an American hero and deserves this long-awaited honor,” Gardner said. “Veterans like Joe George and Donald Stratton are the best this country has to offer and I thank God every day for Americans like them.”

In July, Arizona survivor Donald Stratton recalled the horror he experienced by the Japanese on Dec. 7, 1941.

“We got hit with the big bomb and that exploded like a million pounds of ammunition. The fireball went about 60, 70 feet in the air,” said Stratton, in an interview with Fox News before his visit to Washington.

“The explosion could have taken us away, but it didn't and thank God we made it across,” he added.

Stratton told the story of the man who passed him the vital lifeline to help him and five other USS Arizona sailors make it to safety.

Trapped aboard the sinking Arizona, Stratton and the others managed to escape the carnage, which killed 1,177 of his shipmates, with the help of a fellow sailor who threw them a lifeline from his own ship moored next to Arizona.

With burns over 60 percent of his body, Stratton had to escape his burning warship.

“We proceeded to go hand over hand across the line about 70 feet,” said Stratton. Today, he doesn’t have fingerprints and carries scars across his body, a daily reminder of the horrors he endured at Pearl Harbor.

The toughest part was reaching the middle of the sagging line stretched across the two ships, and climbing up to the other ship.

“He kept saying, ""Come on sailor! You can make it,"" recalled Stratton about his rescuer, who remained a mystery for 60 years.

The man who rescued Stratton and his fellow sailors that day: Joe George.

In his book, ""All the Gallant Men,"" Stratton described George as ""perhaps the strongest man in the harbor, an All-Navy Boxer.""

Stratton says George disobeyed his captain's order and threw Stratton the line that would save his life.

""It was kind of surreal. You grow up with your dad thinking of him as dad; you're not used to thinking of him as a hero,"" said George’s daughter, Joe Ann Taylor, in a statement. ""But it's a wonderful story and I'm quite proud of him. Plus I've gotten to know the men he saved and have developed a real bond with the Stratton and Bruner families.""

In an oral history documenting the Pearl Harbor attack conducted by the University of North Texas in 1978, George said on Dec. 7 he was settling down to read the Sunday newspaper when the General Quarters alarm was sounded. That's when he realized there was an attack underway. After seeing a Japanese plane going down, his training kicked in and he began to act.

With Japanese torpedoes striking Arizona, George recalled that the first thing he did, with help from several of his shipmates, was remove the awning covering the guns so that Vestal could fight back. Then he ran across the deck from fire to fire to help put them out.

There were ""people over on the Arizona that were trying to get off, and there was fire all around,"" George said. ""I threw a line over.""

Stratton's granddaughter, Nikki, says she owes her life, in addition to her grandfather's, to that young sailor's heroic actions.

“We have four generations here because of that man. We have 14 people in our family who wouldn’t necessarily be here without Joe George,” said Nikki Stratton.

“We just kept asking, asking and asking and finally someone was able to dig through some of the archives and some of the interviews of the sailors about what happened that day and we found the name Joe George,” she said.

His family asked the Navy to investigate his rescue and dig up interviews from the sailors who were at Pearl Harbor.

In 2001, Donald Stratton was attending his 60th reunion of Pearl Harbor survivors when he learned the identity of the man who rescued him. Sadly, Stratton never had a chance to thank his hero for saving his life. Joe George died in 1996.

“He saved six people's lives and he didn't get anything,” said Stratton in July. “Somebody in Washington should have the guts and honor to take care of that.”

“It is a wonderful thing my father did. I am always overwhelmed by the story,” George’s daughter said. “Finding out what he did and how he did it – he did his duty, and it’s a shame he has never been recognized for it.”

The Stratton family has set up a website, USS Arizona Final Salute, to help defray costs of the trip to Washington and raise money for other USS Arizona survivors to attend a future reunion in Hawaii in December.",Pearl Harbor hero recognized 76 years after saving 6 from sinking USS Arizona,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/07/pearl-harbor-hero-recognized-76-years-after-saving-6-from-sinking-uss-arizona.html

Kayla Moore made the comment at a rally for her husband in rural Alabama Monday night.

She says the ""fake news"" has falsely accused her husband of being against women in office and black and Jewish people.

She adds: ""Well, one of our attorneys is a Jew. We have very close friends who are Jewish and rabbis.""

Kayla Moore says she wanted to clear the record for the large media presence at her husband's final rally before Tuesday's vote.

Alabama Republican Roy Moore is using his closing campaign rally to lash out at sexual misconduct accusations against him.

Speaking at a Monday night rally, Moore is urging his supporters to get to the polls Tuesday and calling the article that first raised allegations against him ""disgusting.""

Moore, 70, faces allegations of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls decades ago.

Moore says, ""If you don't believe in my character, don't vote for me.""

Moore, who was twice removed as state Chief Justice for thwarting court orders regarding the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage, argued the nation must ""go back to God.""

He says, ""I want America great and I want America good and we can't be good until we go back to God,"" Moore said.

About 50 protesters gathered outside Republican Roy Moore's final rally of the U.S. Senate race in Alabama.

The group on Monday night chanted ""Country over party, vote Doug Jones"" and ""Don't let a pedophile in office.""

Many carried Jones signs. Some women were dressed as handmaids — from the novel and TV drama ""The Handmaid's Tale"" — to symbolize Moore's accusers, whom they said are being silenced.

Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers when he was in his 30s.

Christina Evans, 24, says being a GOP candidate in a Republican state should not excuse Moore's behavior.

8 p.m.

Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones says it's time for Alabama voters to say ""enough is enough.""

He says his campaign against Republican Roy Moore is about the state choosing ""the right path"" rather than following a history he says is marred with bad choices.

Jones notes Moore was twice tossed off the Alabama Supreme Court for ignoring federal law and has since been accused of molesting and trying to date teenage girls when he was in his 30s.

The Democrat says ""decency"" demands not supporting Moore.

Given Alabama's conservative bent, Jones needs support from Republicans to win Tuesday. He is reminding voters that Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby has publicly confirmed he wrote in another Republican on his ballot rather than back Moore.

Former professional basketball star Charles Barkley says Alabama voters must send Democrat Doug Jones to the Senate to assure the rest of the nation ""we're not a bunch of damn idiots.""

An Alabama native, Barkley says Republican Roy Moore would continue to embarrass a state that has a history of politicians garnering negative attention.

Barkley is speaking at Jones' final campaign rally before polls open Tuesday morning.

He took aim at Moore's top celebrity campaigner, Steve Bannon. President Donald Trump's former adviser was also in Alabama on Monday.

Barkley called Bannon a ""white separatist nationalist"" and said he and Moore are courting voters who hold Alabama back.

Barkley is from outside Birmingham. He has commented over the years on Alabama politics, periodically entertaining the idea of running for governor.

Moore says the ads have been ""ugly."" He laments the tone of the campaign and says he's been the recipient of vicious, unfounded attacks.

Moore faces several allegations of sexual misconduct, including the accusation that he molested a 14-year-old girl decades ago when he was in his 30s. He has denied the accusations.

Senate pages must be high school juniors, at least 16 years old, and attend school. Their duties include delivering legislation and correspondence at the Capitol. They attend classes in the morning.

Moore wrote that Congress has an obligation to keep the pages safe.

Biden held a rally for Jones in Birmingham, Ala. earlier this year and has also recorded a call for Jones.

The Jones camp is sending out dozens of types of calls on the eve of the election to urge turnout. They include a news clip in which Republican Sen. Richard Shelby said that Alabama deserves better than Moore.

She writes: ""I strongly disagree with the recent RNC financial support directed to the Alabama Republican Party for use in the Roy Moore race.""

Simmons adds that she wishes she could have continued her service ""to the national Republican Party that I used to know well.'

The RNC had pulled support from Moore after the allegations surfaced against him last month. But the organization re-entered the race once President Donald Trump endorsed Moore, citing the need for a Republican in the seat.

3:35 a.m.

Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones are making their final pushes ahead of Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama.

Jones and Democrats are framing the election as a way for Alabama to reject its history of politicians with baggage that hampers the state.

Republicans say it is about keeping a conservative hold on Alabama and not giving Democrats any opportunity to derail President Donald Trump's agenda before the 2018 midterms.

In truth, the matchup is a mix of Alabama's history and the partisan divides plaguing Washington.

Jones says it would be disastrous to elect Moore after the former judge was accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Moore denies the charges.

EXCLUSIVE – A Republican congressman plans to introduce a bill Monday that would threaten huge fines and prison time for elected officials accused of sheltering illegal immigrant criminals from deportation, in the wake of the not-guilty verdict in the Kate Steinle murder trial.

Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita’s bill is one of the most aggressive pieces of legislation to date aimed at sanctuary city policies, going beyond the Justice Department’s threat to cut off grants to those jurisdictions.

“Politicians don’t get to pick and choose what laws to comply with,” Rokita told Fox News. “Americans are dying because politicians sworn to uphold the law refuse to do so.”

His “Stopping Lawless Actions of Politicians (SLAP) Act” would hold state and local lawmakers criminally responsible for refusing to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The Republican’s bill would subject violators to a $1 million fine and up to five years in prison if they are convicted.

“It’s time the federal government gets serious about enforcing immigration laws and holding politicians accountable who conspire to break them,” said Rokita.

Rokita also supported “Kate’s Law” – legislation that would boost penalties for illegal immigrants who were previously deported and that was named after Steinle.

On Thursday, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, an illegal immigrant who already had been deported back to Mexico five times, was acquitted in the 2015 murder of Steinle on a San Francisco pier.

Zarate’s attorneys argued Zarate had found a gun that accidentally discharged, and the bullet ricocheted off the ground before hitting Steinle. Prosecutors argued Zarate intentionally shot 32-year-old Steinle.

The killing revived a national debate over sanctuary city policies, as some lawmakers as well as Steinle’s family faulted San Francisco for releasing the suspect from a local jail without notifying federal immigration officials.

President Trump, who frequently cited Steinle’s case on the campaign trail, called the not-guilty verdict “disgraceful” and a “complete travesty of justice.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions took direct aim at the city, saying San Francisco’s “decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.”",Fox News Exclusive: Will Officials Be Imprisoned for Sheltering Illegal Immigrant Criminals?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/04/fox-news-exclusive-will-officials-be-imprisoned-sheltering-illegal-immigrant-criminals#commenting

Kelly Masterton told WGN her eighth grade son, Michael, was given the assignment at Woodland Middle School last week called “If You Give Hitler a Country” modeled after the children’s book, “If you give a mouse a cookie.” The assignment had a cartoon-like “My Little Pony” in a Nazi uniform saluting over a map of Europe.

The students were instructed to “create a comic strip for little kids that exemplifies Europe’s appeasement towards Hitler,” using “fun and colorful” pictures.

“I asked him ‘did you ask the teacher if you could use these images?’ and he said ‘yes,’” she said. “Not sure what’s an appropriate manner to use a swastika.”

Plush, velvety carpet is a wonderful thing to wake up to in the morning. It’s also a practical choice, adding warmth and acoustic protection to a room that’s all about relaxation. We’ve asked three experts to discuss what you need to know if you’re in the market for new soft flooring for your bedroom.

Why Carpet?

The bedroom is a sanctuary for many of us — somewhere we can escape to and recharge for the day ahead. Few things say relaxation better than the feel of soft, luxurious carpet underfoot, says Harriet Isaac-Cole, interior architect at design firm The Designory. “Carpet adds a layer of softness and warmth that hard floor sometimes can’t give you,” she says.

And unlike busy parts of the home such as the hallway and family room, where practicality is likely to steer your design choices, low-traffic bedrooms give you license to indulge in sophisticated materials such as plush and oversized loop-pile carpet.

“Most of our customers will select a more luxurious carpet option for their bedroom compared with the carpet they choose for other areas of the home,” says Jason Verstak, group manager for marketing at Choices Flooring.

Color Trends

Darker hues are dominating in bedroom carpet color choices these days, Isaac-Cole says. “This year it’s all about creating a cozy, luxurious atmosphere in the master bedroom, a retreat away from the rest of the house. As a result, we’re seeing darker colors in plush finishes coming through.”

Maria Roussos, interior decorator at design firm Schemes and Spaces, agrees. “For some time now, sandy and taupe textures have dominated,” she says. “But now there are so many more options in the gray palette in both loop and plush piles, which are gorgeous for the bedroom.”

Consider the Room Design When Selecting Color

“When choosing a carpet, color is the most important element to get right,” Isaac-Cole says. “It needs to link to the rest of the palette as well as complement the other textural elements in the room. Think about your wall color and finish, window treatments, furniture style, even bedding.” Consider what the focal point of the room is and look for a carpet that complements it rather than overpowers it.

You should also consider the feel you want to create. “Ask yourself, ‘How soft or layered do I want the texture and pile of the carpet to be? How do I want it to feel underfoot when I step out of bed?’ ” Isaac-Cole says.

“For versatility, the best carpet shades for most schemes are charcoal, taupe and sand,” Roussos says. And if you have children and pets dashing in and out of your bedroom on a regular basis? “Midtones are the safest choice, as they will disguise dust and stains.”

Pile Types

You should also think about which pile type suits your decor and lifestyle, Verstak says. “Ask yourself what decorating style you want to achieve. Plush and twist styles will give you a more luxe look, for example. If you have a very textured room scheme, you may want to consider a loop or textured carpet.”

A loop-pile carpet can also be used to add a casual vibe to your bedroom, Roussos says. “There are some gorgeous loop piles on the market, in a variety of textures and shades that will give you a relaxed Hamptons or coastal look.”

Tip: “If you’ll be allowing pets into your bedroom, then a twist style is best as their claws won’t get caught in the fibers,” Verstak says.

Pile Height and Density

When choosing a carpet, pay attention to pile height and density as well, Roussos says. “If hotel luxe is the mood you’re aiming for, a long, plush pile carpet is the ultimate choice. Shorter, tighter piles are harder- wearing and will show less wear and indentation.”

Materials

There are several materials to choose from, including wool, nylon, wool-nylon blends and more luxurious options such as alpaca and wool-silk blends. “For softness, luxury and graceful aging, pure wool carpet is hard to beat,” Verstak says. “In addition to its natural, sustainable and insulating properties, wool carpet is also easy to maintain.”

Isaac-Cole is also a fan of wool: “It’s definitely an enduring favorite, low in allergens and with perfect softness.”

That’s not to say you should rule out nylon, particularly the latest high-quality solution-dyed nylons. “Thanks to technological innovations, synthetic carpets are becoming softer and more luxurious all the time,” Verstak says. “Generally speaking, they are more cost-efficient, hard-wearing and stain-resistant than pure wool carpets.”

For the best of both worlds, consider a wool blend, which will give you the durability of a synthetic and the natural appeal of wool, Verstak says. “They are perfect for those wanting a wool carpet that also keeps up with the practicality of busy lifestyles,” he says.

Be Aware of Shading

If you have your heart set on a plush carpet, be aware that shading is a feature of this style. “Plush carpets are created by cutting the loops and then shearing the tips of the fibers,” Verstak says. “Pile reversal shading is when there appears to be a color difference in the carpet when you walk or vacuum over it. For that reason, plush carpet is generally best used in the master bedroom or other quiet spaces in the home.”

Color also plays a part in how noticeable this effect is, Roussos says. “Carpet shading is usually more obvious in darker shades than lighter ones.”

Do Your Homework

With so many options available, choosing the right carpet style can be a challenge. But there are a few things you can do to make the process easier.

“It’s a good idea to take along images to the showroom of the look you want to create, as well as materials and colors that you’ve selected for the room,” Verstak says. “When you’ve narrowed down your options, take home samples so you can see what they look like at different times of the day and under different light conditions.”

And of course, don’t forget to put your favorite styles to the most important test of all: the softness test. For this, all you need to do is slip off your shoes and let your toes sink in.",8 things to consider when adding carpet to your bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/16/8-things-to-consider-when-adding-carpet-to-your-bedroom.html

The 22-year-old was at a video shoot for LOVE Magazine’s Advent calendar series, where she represented Day 11 in the Christmas countdown.

Hadid was recorded doing some boxing moves, stretching and spiking a volleyball during the minute-long clip. But her athletic prowess isn’t what people are talking about – it’s the supermodel’s potentially hairy armpits.

A post shared by LOVE MAGAZINE (@thelovemagazine) on Dec 11, 2017 at 1:01am PST

In the beginning of the video, Hadid is seen sporting a blue crop top as part of her collaborative line with Tommy Hilfiger, Gigi X Tommy. However, after she starts working up a sweat with her kicks and spikes, Hadid sheds the covering and is left standing in a red sports bra and athletic shorts – also from her line.

At the end of the video, Hadid raises her bare arms up to flex her muscles, but is instead upstaged by her armpits, which appear to be unshaved.

People started talking about whether Hadid was making a statement by not shaving her underarms – which some celebrities have started doing.

People took the question to social media where some were supportive, commenting, “Love her and her armpits hair.”

One was especially moved by the look and wrote on Instagram, “I praise Gigi for this! Show the world that women DO grow body hair and that it shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of just because we’re female.”

While others were disgusted by the possibility and said, “Her armpits not shaved ewwwww.”

Others said, “Horrible armpit hair” and “Just shave.”

However, those comments may have all been in vain after reports from TMZ have confirmed that the debris under her arms was just fuzz from the blue jacket she was wearing before.

The two men then filed a lawsuit against him. But contrary to what they allege, Phillips didn’t discriminate against them.

This is a tale of FBI power misused and presidential trust misplaced.

Last week, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s confidant on matters pertaining to national security from June 2015 to February 2017 and his short-lived national security adviser in the White House, pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington, D.C., to a single count of lying to the FBI. Under the terms of his plea agreement, Flynn, who had faced nearly 60 years in federal prison had he been convicted of charges related to all the matters about which there is said to be credible evidence of his guilt, will now face six months.

What could have caused Robert Mueller, the no-nonsense special counsel investigating whether any Americans aided the Russian government in its now well-known interference in the 2016 American presidential election, to have given Flynn such an extraordinary deal?

Here is the back story.

During the FBI’s investigation of Russian meddling in the election, it became interested in Flynn’s communications with Sergey Kislyak, a KGB colonel (the KGB is now known by its post-Soviet acronym, FSB) masquerading as the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

After Trump won the presidency, Flynn became an important member of the presidential transition team. Between the election and the inauguration, Flynn spoke on the telephone with Kislyak five times. Because Kislyak was a foreign spy, as well as an ambassador, his communications with Americans were monitored by the FBI.

When Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI in his West Wing office on Jan. 24, he probably did not know what the agents were looking for. Jim Comey was still the director of the FBI. Mueller had not yet been named special counsel. The FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the just-completed presidential election was in its infancy.",Judge Napolitano: The General and the President,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/07/judge-napolitano-general-and-president#commenting

The German Shephard, Ronin, had just landed after taking a redeye from California to Boston. The pup was in his crate when his new owner, Nick Kaneiff, picked him up at the airport. However, once Kaneiff opened the door to put on Ronin’s leash, the dog bolted from the carrier.

Keneiff and his 8-year-old son, James, stayed in pursuit of their pup as he eluded them and members of the State Police, Boston police and Massport Fire Rescue for nearly three hours, according to the Boston Globe.

DOG BITES THROUGH CAGE, ESCAPES ONTO TARMAC AT FLORIDA AIRPORT PRIOR TO DELTA FLIGHT

At 8:20 a.m., Ronin was reportedly spotted in shallow water outside the airport by State Police Lieutenant Nunzio Orlando, the Boston Globe said.

The chase continued down at the harbor, where Ronin continued to evade capture.

“Every time they tried to approach the dog he would run from the shore into the water,” State Police spokesman David Procopio told the Boston Globe. “When it got to the point where the water was over his head and he had to swim, he would return toward the shore, and this went on for more than 2 ½ hours. It was like cat and mouse . . . er, cat and dog . . . or something.”

Finally, after hours of chasing, the police managed to surround Ronin on the rocky harbor shore and try to coax him toward them.

Trooper Randall Enos of the K-9 unit held out a tennis ball toward the stubborn dog, but Ronin stayed away. Then Enos tried a squeaky toy, with which Ronin was unimpressed.

The police seemed to have exhausted their efforts of convincing Ronin to come back to his owners, when Kanieff’s son, James, had a brilliant idea.

The boy reached into a take-out box and produced pieces of bacon and sausage for the dog.

“C’mere, Ronin,” James said, the Boston Globe reported.

Ronin tentatively approached the boy and took the meat.

While Ronin was distracted with the protein-packed snack, Kaneiff ran up to his vehicle and brought out the pet carrier.

Working together, the group lured Ronin into the crate with scraps of the meat.

“Let him take his time,” Trooper Steve Culver said.

Ronin managed to make his way back inside his pet carrier and James closed the door, ready to bring his new dog home.

Ronin is not the first four-legged friend to get loose at Logan Airport. In fact, Enos said it happens every couple of months.

Usually the authorities are able to corner the runaways in the fire station parking lot nearby, he said. But other times, the pursuit can take much longer than the 2 and a half it took for them to catch Ronin.

The publication reported that in February 2008, a cocker spaniel-poole mix wandered around Logan for three days before it was caught.

Thanks to American leadership and a new strategy on the battlefield, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was able to declare that ISIS has been defeated in Iraq. While this is welcome news, crushing the so-called ‘caliphate’ in the Middle East, allows foreign fighters and sympathizers of ISIS and Al Qaeda to scatter.

They are returning to their home countries, looking for different ways to keep their hateful ideology alive and creating new dangers in other parts of the world. This has brought a new wave of terror attacks to the West.

European cities once known for their culture and history, are becoming well known for deadly attacks. They include London, Brussels, Paris, Nice, Barcelona and Berlin. And the bombing at the Port Authority this morning is already the second attack in New York in under two months.

As Americans, we cannot forget that we are in this fight together. Terrorists do not check our political affiliations before they carry out an attack. - House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul

Islamist extremists are clearly answering the call of Sheik Adnani to kill Westerners using whatever means necessary wherever they are. Since our enemies our constantly adjusting their tactics, we must remain agile in defense of our nation.

To defeat these threats, we need to work with tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to take down radical propaganda that preaches hate and recruits new members to the terrorist cause. The advancement of technology has brought great benefits, but is has also been a powerful tool for our adversaries. The internet been a constant lifeline, allowing them to effectively plot and communicate at lightning speed.

We must also bolster the security of our airports with the most advanced screening technology available. Even though many of the attacks in the last year have been vehicular homicides, our aviation sector is still the “crown jewel” of targets.

Lastly, the U.S. must continue to lead an international alliance dedicated to using all of its economic, intelligence, military, and other resources to dry up funding for terrorists and destroy them on the battlefield.

As Americans, we cannot forget that we are in this fight together. Terrorists do not check our political affiliations before they carry out an attack. We will have political differences on many issues, but our commitment to keeping our homeland safe and secure should be a national priority for everyone.

We cannot allow the cowardly acts of terrorists to shake our will or dent our morale.

On Sept. 28, football players at Monroe Township High School in New Jersey knelt during the national anthem.","The continuing protests by multimillionaire NFL players who refuse to stand for our national anthem – disrespecting our flag and the brave patriots in our armed forces – are setting a terrible example for America’s children as Thanksgiving approaches.

The message? Don't be thankful for the many blessings America has given you. Instead, act ungratefully, disrespectfully and unpatriotically

And sadly, some children are now following that example.

To cite just a few examples of protests around the country:

Four high school football players from Michigan were benched when they said they planned a kneeling protest. In Texas, two high school players were kicked off their team after protesting during the anthem. Good decisions in both cases.

And football players on a team made up of boys 8 and younger were joined by their coach in kneeling during the playing of our anthem in Illinois, after the coach told them about the protests started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Unbelievably, the coach said: “I felt like it was a good teaching moment for me.”

Teaching what? Hatred of America?

Schools are hyper-vigilant nowadays about not tolerating student expressions that might offend anyone. For example, a school in Texas shut down a voluntary Bible discussion during the lunch hour. God – oops, pardon that expression – forbid that any atheist child should be offended.

If students banded together in a planned show of disrespect for a rainbow flag – the symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride – you’d better believe they’d be punished for intolerance.

And if students held a protest objecting to radical political Islam, there’s no doubt they’d be disciplined for bigotry. The same would happen if students denounced and disrespected any country on Earth – with one exception.

When student football players disrespect America, our anthem and our flag, what happens? They get applauded by the left. That’s because the left hugs First Amendment language like an endangered tree when it comes to disrespecting the American flag and our anthem.

In 2010 the Department of Justice began studying bullying in school based upon “national origin” and other differences. That’s no surprise. There’s been a federally recognized prohibition against discriminating against national origin since the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

The federal government’s website dedicated to eradicating direct and indirect bullying noted this example of prohibited conduct from North Carolina: ""Bullying or harassing behavior includes … acts ... motivated by any actual or perceived differentiating characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin.”

Bullying of this kind is frequent. A New York survey this year of middle and high school students showed that 65 percent of respondents said bullying occurred because of “race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or citizenship/immigration status.”

So what does the federal government do with a local bullying incident in the United States? The Justice Department, explaining on its website about an LGBT student it helped, said it intervenes:

“The School District knew of the harassment ... neither fully investigated the allegations, nor followed its anti-harassment policies and procedures. The failure to address and prevent this kind of bullying from occurring violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”

Let’s examine how a recent real-life incident of anthem kneeling could still play out.

On Sept. 28, football players at Monroe Township High School in New Jersey knelt during the national anthem. Two referees walked off in protest, leaving the legitimacy of the game in doubt. Only the refs were punished, being suspended for the rest of the season.

Monroe has a bullying policy. In pertinent part it defines and prohibits as follows:

“Harassment, intimidation, or bullying means any gesture ... motivated by either any actual or perceived characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression; that ... has the effect of insulting or demeaning any student or group of students.”

What should happen next is that a parent of any American student insulted by the disrespect for America should demand that the school enforce Monroe’s bullying policy and discipline the kneelers.

If the school doesn’t act, the parent has a private right of action to sue the school under Title IX. The parent can have the Justice Department intervene to enforce their child’s rights.

Normally I don’t encourage making a federal case out of school disciplinary matters, but if the left keeps jumping us with culture rumbles, we have to take their own weapons to use on them.",NFL national anthem protests are teaching our children to NOT be thankful for America,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/22/nfl-national-anthem-protests-are-teaching-our-children-to-not-be-thankful-for-america.html

What kind of welcome would Roy Moore receive in Washington?

On Tuesday, the good people of Alabama will decide whether to vote for Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who is accused of multiple accounts of inappropriate sexual contact with underage girls. Beside Moore on the ballot is Doug Jones, a pro-abortion candidate who generally supports the policies associated with his party’s secular progressive platform.

Should the good Republicans of Alabama vote for Moore, for Jones, or for a write-in candidate?

Should conservatives across the nation support Moore or speak out against his candidacy?

GOP leaders are divided.

Some Republican leaders support Moore’s candidacy. President Trump, for example, supports Moore because, “The future of this country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate.” Similarly, Alabama’s governor Kay Ivey argues that significant policy issues are more important than Moore’s past.

Other Republican leaders argue unequivocally that Alabamans should disown Moore. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, declared that “Roy Moore will never have the support of the senatorial committee. We will never endorse him. We won’t support him.” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says that Moore will “immediately” face a Senate Ethics Committee probe should he win. Speaker Paul Ryan has repeatedly called for Moore to drop out of the race.

What is best for our nation, for vulnerable women, and for the Republican party?

But GOP leaders are not the only people who must make up their minds about Moore. The good people of Alabama must cast their votes, and conservatives across the nation must make our voices heard on this matter of national significance.

The 23-year-old, who starred in nearly 290 movies, was found dead Tuesday morning in California. In mid-September, she appeared in a podcast where she detailed experiencing “a lot of sexual molestation” while growing up, adding that the offender was not her father, the Independent reported.

“It was just awful. It’s still recent where I have to keep myself occupied or else I start thinking about all that s—t and then I fall into a depression,” she said, citing the podcast. “I try to do therapy. I hate that word. I hate therapy.”

Ames said therapists would judge her after she revealed she worked in the adult industry. She then detailed her past drug abuse and how she used it to escape her issues.

“I don’t drink alcohol anymore. When I would drink, I’d black out every time. I used to smoke a lot of weed too, I used to be a big stoner but I’ve cut that out too. I just drink water now,” Ames said.

She added that she resorted to medication for her bipolar disorder, depression and multiple personality disorder. She recalled the “crippling” feeling when she wasn’t on medication.

Ames received major backlash in early December after she tweeted that she declined filming for a movie after she discovered the male actor also worked on gay pornography. She cited health safety reasons and insisted she was “not homophobic” and just wasn’t willing to put her “body at risk.”

“Whichever (lady) performer is replacing me tomorrow for @EroticaXNews , you’re shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn, just to let cha know. BS is all I can say…Do agents really not care about who they’re representing? #ladirect I do my homework for my body,” she tweeted.

Despite her insistence, several people accused her of being homophobic. Jaxton Wheeler, an adult film star, also took to Twitter to criticize Ames and said in a now-deleted tweet that Ames should “swallow a cyanide pill” for her comments. He posted the tweet after her death and soon apologized for his “out of context comment.” It's unclear if he knew about her death when the tweet was posted.

“My gay community friends please a life is lost and we gain nothing from anything but showing respect and sympathy, her fans and loved ones are upset, I'm sickened in my out of context comment. As I stated before anyone even made my tweet a thing,” Wheeler said.

2018 is going to be one rough ride.

President Trump’s supporters are intensifying their attacks on the Justice Department investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Anyone listening only to right-wing talk radio and television would assume Special Counsel Robert Mueller is “corrupt” (that’s according to Newt Gingrich); the leader of a “silent coup” (according to Rush Limbaugh); and a bad guy whose “credibility is in the gutter” (according to Sean Hannity). The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page has already said Mueller should “step down.”

The president is personally rallying his troops to help derail the investigation by throwing dirt at the FBI. On Twitter, he has said the FBI’s reputation is in “tatters” and “the worst in history.”

These baseless, partisan assaults on law enforcement are just a slice of the biggest unresolved problem in American politics — the power of propaganda.

Google, Facebook and Twitter have to be held to account for the enormous platforms they give to propaganda that is tearing down the country.

Trust in American democracy as a “shining city upon a hill” for all freedom loving people, to quote President Reagan, is being unraveled by partisan echo chambers and internet-based propaganda.

The result is an endless airing of conspiracy theories and the equally relentless stoking of grievances against political foes.

America’s enemies know we have a problem.

In October, Facebook turned over to congressional investigators more than 3,000 advertisements placed by Russian sites during the 2016 presidential campaign. The company said 10 million people viewed those advertisements.

Twitter found 200 accounts tied to Facebook pages under Russian control. Google reported the Internet Research Agency, a company with ties to the Kremlin, put 1,000 videos on YouTube.

The New York Times reported in October that the “disinformation campaign spread well beyond Facebook to sites like Reddit, Instagram, 4chan and Imgur…making it more difficult to curb the tide of fake accounts.”

The goal of the Russian social media assault was to disrupt American democracy by splitting the country into warring camps, divided on hot button issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, gun ownership, gay rights and immigration.

The Russians also promoted candidate Donald Trump.

Russia’s version of Facebook even offered to help the Trump campaign, according to a report last week in The Washington Post, by offering to “promote Trump’s campaign to its nearly 100 million users.”

In October, executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter were grilled by a Senate subcommittee on their underwhelming response to Russia’s success in manipulating American public opinion.

“The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter’s acting general counsel said, asking for patience.

“It’s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) who chaired the hearing, told the New York Times. “What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.”

A bipartisan group of senators led by Republican John McCain (Ariz.) and Democrats Mark Warner (Va.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) has introduced legislation, the Honest Ads Act, to do just that: require the companies to publicly disclose who is paying for political advertisements online.

It’s unclear when, or whether, congressional leaders will advance the bill.

But Google, Facebook and Twitter have to be held to account for the enormous platforms they give to propaganda that is tearing down the country.

Yet not everyone agrees. A November Axios poll conducted by Survey Monkey found that 62 percent of American adults do not want the government to regulate social media companies like other media companies. Just 34 percent do. According to the poll, a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents say they want government to stay out of it.

In that case, what is to stop Russia and other bad actors from continuing to screw with American elections?

“Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google have grown to encompass duties to the public trust — duties that these companies were never intended to handle in the first place,” Jim Geraghty wrote in the conservative National Review last week.

Before the 2016 election, little thought was given to how “empowering everyone to send short messages, post videos or create online communities meant it would empower terrorists, criminals, hate groups, garden-variety nut-jobs and child predators to do the same things,” he wrote.

And what about Russia and other foreign powers out to cripple American democracy?

“Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google realize that whether or not they intended to be media companies or want to be media companies, they have become media companies, and they need to take responsibility for what appears on their platforms,” he argued.

Geraghty is right. Now is the time to revive the doctrine of corporate social responsibility as hostile foreign powers are no doubt plotting to again use social media to disrupt next year’s election.

Couric eventually replied to her fan saying, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to,” Couric responded on her Instagram post, according to The Wrap. “Thanks for your interest.”

People have been waiting for a response from Couric since the news broke of Lauer being fired from NBC for sexual misconduct back in November. Her comment was Couric’s first step towards any public statement on Lauer, but some people were not so pleased with what Couric had to say on the social platform.

NBC News Chairman Andy Lack released a memo to fellow employees on Wednesday, November 29, after a complaint against Lauer was filed by a staffer detailing “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” Lauer was fired shortly after.

The announcement was then made at the top of the “Today” show, featuring words from heartbroken co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb.

Lauer was a veteran co-host of the “Today” which he joined in 1994. The budding on-air journalist began as a news anchor for the show and became a co-host three years later. Lauer was the longest-serving “Today” host in history with a $20 million dollar contract according to a New York Post report. The long-time host celebrated his 20th anniversary of commenting at the Macy’s Parade over Thanksgiving.

In 2012, Lauer was widely blamed for the firing of co-host Ann Curry, who was ousted from the show after only one year as a co-host. On Curry’s last day, the two shared a tearful and awkward on-air goodbye, which continued to fuel the rumors of Lauer’s involvement with her departure.

In a recent interview with People magazine, Curry admitted to “still processing” Lauer’s termination, but didn’t speak any further on the incident. Instead, she expressed her admiration for all the women this year who have been brave enough to speak out against sexual harassment in the workplace.

“Those women need to keep their jobs, and all women need to be able to work, to be able to thrive, without fear.

One star is even going as far as to reward the young boy in a big way.

Kimberly Jones said in a Facebook post Friday she had just picked up her son, Keaton, from school because he was too afraid to go to lunch.

The video of Keaton had more than 18 million views as of Sunday, and a crowdsourcing page for his future education has raised more than $29,000.

The post has gone so viral that celebrities far and wide are taking notice and offering their support to young Keaton. However, one star is going above and beyond to reward the young boy for his persevearance. Chris Evans, who will reprise his role as Captain America in the upcoming ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" took to Twitter to not only share his support, but to invite the young boy to Los Angeles for the film's premiere.

""Stay strong, Keaton. Don't let them make you turn cold. I promise it gets better,"" the star wrote. ""While those punks at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be in this world, how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year?""

While Evans offer of a real red carpet premiere is, arguably, one of the best gifts that stars are hoping to bestow upon Keaton, it's hardly the only one.

As People notes, Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White offered to let the boy come to Las Vegas to hang out at UFC headquarters.

""If he takes you up on your offer to see UFC Headquarters, I would be honored to host him and his family at our place if they need somewhere to stay,"" Donald Trump Jr. added.

On Twitter, Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker invited the Jones family to an upcoming game, while University of Tennessee wide receiver Tyler Byrd said he and several teammates plan to visit Keaton at school.

Country music star Kelsea Ballerini tweeted that the next time she comes home to her native Knoxville, she wants to be with Keaton to witness the bullies apologize.

Retired race car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. said on Twitter he wants Keaton to ""add me to your long list of friends,"" and Snoop Dogg said on Instagram that Keaton ""has a friend for life"" and that ""love is the only way to beat hate.""

In the video, Keaton said other students call him ugly, make fun of his nose and tell him he has no friends. He said milk was poured on him and ham was put down his clothes.

""Just out of curiosity, why do they bully?"" Keaton said. ""What's the point of it? Why do they find joy in taking innocent people and find a way to be mean to them? It's not OK.

""People that are different don't need to be criticized about it. It's not their fault. If you are made fun of, just don't let it bother you.""

Poor circulationWhen your body is healing a wound, red blood cells are the ones that carry new cells to the site.
If you have poor circulation, the blood will move to the wound site more slowly, delaying the healing process.","Like a lot of other good things in life, wound-healing is a process. You probably didn’t enjoy the events that earned you your cuts and scrapes, but when you do have them, you get to watch your body perform an amazing work.

However, time doesn’t necessarily heal all wounds. If several weeks have already gone by, you might be left wondering about your open scrapes. It’s important for you to find out why your wound won’t heal properly and what exactly you can do about it.

Reasons Your Wound Won’t Heal

1. Infection

Your skin is your body’s first line of defense against bacteria. When the skin breaks, bacteria can then move from the outside to inside the body. If the wound area gets infected, you may notice persistent redness, swelling, pain and an off-color or foul-smelling fluid.

2. Nutrition

Are you getting enough fruits and vegetables? The vitamins in them help your body heal faster, especially vitamins A and C.

THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEPING WELL

Make sure you’re eating foods like oranges, spinach, sweet potatoes and bell peppers to help your body do its job. You’ll also need plenty of lean protein along the way.

3. Diabetes

Because of elevated blood sugar, diabetics have an increased risk for slow-healing wounds and infection. The high blood sugar can negatively affect your circulation and immune system.

It can also damage nerves that signal pain, leading to more wounds simply because the diabetics don’t know when something is hurting them. If you notice slow-healing wounds regularly, they could be a sign of this disease, especially recurrent wounds on the legs and feet.

4. Medication

Different medications could also identify as your culprit for slow wound-healing. Chemotherapy and radiation drugs have powerful chemicals that hamper your immune system, making the healing process harder.

Antibiotics kill off good bacteria, increasing your risk of an infected wound site. In addition, anti-inflammatory drugs might inhibit the inflammatory stage that your body goes through in healing wounds. If you suspect that your medication is causing the problem, discuss your concern with a doctor.

5. Poor circulation

When your body is healing a wound, red blood cells are the ones that carry new cells to the site. In turn, they help form the foundation for new skin with collagen.

If you have poor circulation, the blood will move to the wound site more slowly, delaying the healing process. You may have poor circulation due to diabetes, obesity, blood clots, arterial build-up or some other underlying condition.

6. Bed Sores

Bed sores (technically pressure ulcers) usually occur when a person is bedridden or immobile for long periods. For instance, a bedridden patient will have pressure on certain areas of the body that press up against the bed.

That pressure can cause varying levels of sores, eventually leading to a gaping wound and infection if not cared for properly. Mild sores should go away quickly with regular relief and movement from those pressure points, but moderate or severe sores will need medical treatment.

7. Drinking Alcohol

This bad habit gets worse when you consider all the health effects on your body, including slow-healing wounds. In one 2014 study published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, researchers found that binge drinking significantly increases infections while hospitalized.

Of these infections are surgical site wounds. According to the study, excessive alcohol decreases important white blood cells in the body that fend off bacteria.

8. Venous Leg Ulcers

Venous leg ulcers happen when a wound on your leg is slow to heal. Many times, the ulcers occur because of poor circulation in the veins of the legs.

FENDING OFF TOXIC MOLD SYNDROME

Since the legs need a good push to get blood circulation back up to the heart, blood might tend to pool in the legs. In turn, the pressure can weaken the surrounding skin, causing problems with wounds and their healing. Venous leg ulcers often happen in bony areas like the ankles.

How to Properly Care for a Wound

In many cases, you can help the healing process of mild wounds with proper care. These suggestions from the American Academy of Dermatology will help you stave off infection:

Gently wash the area with mild soap and water.

Keep the wound moist to prevent scabbing, which prolongs healing. The AAD suggests petroleum jelly.

Keep the wound bandaged and clean every day. As long as the wound stays clean, you do not need antibacterial ointments.

Follow any orders from your doctor, especially if you have stitches.

When to Get Help

In nearly all of these scenarios, you will want to seek your doctor’s advice. You should know that normal wound-healing can take up to 3 weeks, but you shouldn’t wait much longer than that to see your doctor. If a wound has not healed after a month, it’s time to seek professional help.

Through the amazing process of wound-healing, your body has the ability to close a mild scrape or cut on its own. However, this process can be hampered for a variety of reasons. For instance, a scabbed wound may take longer to heal. In most cases, though, you will need to talk about your situation with your doctor. Protecting your body’s defense system is the best way to stop deeper problems before they get started.

“Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend who wants to meet your parents but you actually don’t want them to meet?” asks one advert on the Chinese Internet, Yahoo Style reports.

But those acting as a stand-in parents aren’t the only ones advertising. Consumers are equally as vocal about needing a fake mom or dad.

""A rented parent is needed,” one person commented. “Just need to make a phone call to my teacher.""

Another asked: ""Is there anyone in Shanghai who can be rented as parents to have a meal with my girlfriend?""

What sets this Tennessee mother and daughter’s pictures apart, however, is their bare heads.

Kristi, 38, lost her hair while battling breast cancer, while her 7-year-old daughter has Alopecia, which happens when the immune system attacks hair follicles, causing hair loss, the National Alopecia Areata Foundation states.

COUPLE CELEBRATES 47 YEARS OF MARRIAGE WITH PORTRAITS BY PHOTOGRAPHER DAUGHTER

Recently celebrating their health (and temporary resemblance) with a stunning photoshoot at a Nashville area farm, the Tavenners never expected their pictures to go viral.

""It was just supposed to be something for us to mark this time. I didn't realize how strongly they would come across,” Kristi said of the pictures, according to Cosmopolitan. “I'm still pretty taken aback that so many people seem to be touched by them.”

""I thought it would be good that Rose wouldn’t feel alone, but I was scared to lose my hair, and I was worried about how Rose would feel when my hair started coming back [after my chemotherapy] and hers didn’t,"" the mother-of-three said. Though her daughter lost her hair after being diagnosed with Alopecia in 2015, she is perfectly healthy.

While Tavenner was initially hesitant to have a photoshoot “my body image was just really low” after shaving her head, she found strength in her young daughter’s strength and happiness.

""It made me feel horrible, like I was making her question her self-confidence because of my insecurities,"" Tavenner told the outlet.

And, as with all conversations at Buzzy’s, everybody had an opinion, including a couple regulars who are vegetarians.
I really don’t care what you choose to eat…and I suspect you feel the same about what I stuff in my piehole.
For me, and all the men and women I know who are still carnivores, we wish the vegetarians well.
Life seems pretty complicated as it is, no point in trying to overthink my love of a standing rib roast.","The other night at Buzzy’s 8 Ball Tavern & Pool Room, home of the all-day Happy Hour, the big argument at the corner booth was; Is a bone-in ribeye steak really better, and hence worth the extra coin, than a boneless ribeye?

As with most debates or pointed discussions at Buzzy’s, nobody really cared about the answer… the conversation’s the thing. And, as with all conversations at Buzzy’s, everybody had an opinion, including a couple regulars who are vegetarians.

Because at Buzzy’s we respect everybody’s God given right to express themselves, we sat and listened as the non-meat eaters explained to the carnivores why beef, really meat in general, is bad for us, our environment, the planet and, of course, those really tasty animals. We managed to pay attention up to the point where they began talking about the levels of methane gas produced by animals raised for food, at which point the discussion devolved to a series of fart jokes. After that, the vegetarians gave up.

Now here’s the thing. I really don’t care what you choose to eat…and I suspect you feel the same about what I stuff in my piehole. But for some folks, it’s not that simple. For some, the act of grabbing an In-N-Out Burger isn’t just about a pit stop for a bag of deliciousness, it’s an act of aggression. Specifically male aggression. And hegemony. Let us not forget hegemony.

For me, and all the men and women I know who are still carnivores, we wish the vegetarians well.

I speak, of course, of the academic Journal of Feminist Geography. This journal publishes a wide variety of well-researched and interesting scholarly pieces and, as with any academic publication, it’s way over my head. The closest I typically get to academic reading is a Chilton’s manual.

But the other day, while at the library killing time at the card catalogue, I spotted an intriguing article titled “Doing Vegetarianism to Destabilize the Meat-Masculinity Nexus in La Plata, Argentina.” This, I thought to myself, looked almost as promising as the last article I had read in this same journal; “Knit and Resist: Placing the PussyHat Project in the Content of Craft Activism.” Intrigued, I used my often remarked upon ability to manipulate the Dewey Decimal System and quickly tracked down the November 2017 issue of the journal.

Settling into one of the beanbag chairs in the Betty-Anne Braithwaite Reflective Reading Room, recently redone after a sizeable donation from Betty’s children Barbara and Horace, I quickly realized that the author is one of those folks who can’t just let me eat my burger in peace.

As a vegetarian, a feminist and a PhD candidate, the author spent several years in Argentina, which as any person worth their weight in brisket knows, is the mecca of meat eating. Well, she looked around at all the Argentinian dudes eating delicious skewered cuts of beef and occasionally pork, and thought what any rational person would think; “… doing vegetarianism in interactions drives social change, contributing to the de-linking of meat from gender hegemony and revealing the resisting and reworking of gender in food spaces.”

Translating the above, the author is posturing that eating meat promotes toxic masculinity. Thus, being a vegetarian is an act of feminism. And if you’re a fella, you can apparently show your support for a non-gender binary world by keeping your mitts off the sausage and focusing on the kale. Or something like that.

To be honest, I wasn’t able to make my way through the entire article. The author is clearly smart, likes vegetables and knows a ton of big words. But she lost me on the deeper meaning of why I like bacon and what it means for the world. I appreciate the fact that people choose not to eat meat for a variety of reasons…some for environmental reasons, some political, some humanitarian and some, bizarrely, because they don’t like the taste. What the hell?

For me, and all the men and women I know who are still carnivores, we wish the vegetarians well. I don’t believe we’ve ever spent a minute at Buzzy’s trying to analyze what it means to be vegetarian, and whether that choice is rooted in de-linking gender stuff from other issues that get peoples knickers in a twist.

Life seems pretty complicated as it is, no point in trying to overthink my love of a standing rib roast. But, as a compromise, the next time I pull up to the drive thru at the In-N-Out, I will ask for them to leave the toxic masculinity off my burger. My cardiologist did mention that cutting back on hegemony would be good for my overall health.

The audio played on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" Monday, which Feldman said he only recently discovered in his car, revealed Feldman naming actor Jon Grissom as his sexual molester when he was interviewed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. Feldman was 15 years old at the time of the alleged abuse that he contends lasted for more than a year and a half.

Feldman thought the police were investigating Grissom at the time, but realized later they were investigating child molestation claims against his friend, pop superstar Michael Jackson.

""They weren't interested in Jon Grissom,"" Feldman told host Dr. Mehmet Oz.

Feldman had previously named Grissom on the same talk show on November 3. Grissom was arrested in 2001 for sexual abuse against a minor.

Feldman said if the police had acted after his interview, it could have stopped Grissom from abusing others.

Feldman also speculated that the police had more nefarious motives in going after Jackson instead of pursuing Feldman's claims against Grissom.

“They were trying to frame Michael Jackson and burying the Corey Feldman story,"" he said.

Feldman told the syndicated talk show that he had ""spent my entire life fighting this battle. No one was listening then. No one is listening now. [The] LAPD is still not investigating it.""

The Santa Barbara County Sherrif's office told Fox News in October that the Feldman tapes from the 1993 Michael Jackson investigation did not exist. But last week they sent an email explaining they had recently found the recordings and turned them over to the Los Angeles Police Department.

Feldman claimed to Dr. Oz that, by chance, he found his copy of the same recordings in the back of his car the day before he learned that the Santa Barbara police had discovered theirs.

Dr. Oz asked Feldman if he felt vindicated.

“Not yet. Vindication will come when my best friend’s (Corey Haim) perpetrators are behind bars, my perpetrators are behind bars,"" said Feldman.

Law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said Ullah had looked at Islamic State group propaganda online and told investigators he was retaliating against U.S. military aggression, but had no direct contact with the group. The people spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the blast.

Many of us have piles upon boxes upon albums of photos that we haven’t picked up in years. This month marks the season of gratitude - the perfect time to take a trip down memory lane. Here are eight ways to finally organize, use and declutter your family photos.

Research. If you’re a history buff or just curious about the strangers staring back at you with striking resemblance, there are a few measures you can take to piece together your family tree. If you know where the photos were taken, dedicate a rainy afternoon to poring over information at the local library. Some newspapers will print photos with a caption asking readers if they recognize people in the picture. You can also hire a genealogist or upload photos online to genealogy sites if you’re willing to pay for research.

Donate. Most of us find it difficult to throw photos away, let alone ones that have been passed down from generation to generation. If you can’t find any connection to your collection, most historical societies accept photos, especially if you can provide some information about how you inherited them.

Reminisce. Pass around family photos and albums at your next family gathering. Stoke the fire and let the storytelling begin! This is a great chance to learn more about your family and introduce your kids to their late relatives who they never met, but can still get to know through cherished photo albums.

Digitize. Printed photos are typically stored in attics, basements and closets and are therefore susceptible to fires, floods and dust. Preserve photos by scanning them yourself, shipping them to a scanning service or hiring someone to scan them for you. Saving photos to the cloud will give them a safe home where they’ll stay vibrant forever.

Display. Gallery walls are very popular in today’s home designs. Use frames all in the same color for a consistent, contemporary look or arrange frames in different shapes and sizes around other wall decor for an eclectic vibe. Hang photos on a wall with track lighting to put your photos in the spotlight.

Scrapbook. Scrapbooks make meaningful holiday gifts full of creativity and personalization. Get the whole family involved by giving each child an age-appropriate task, like taping or labeling, or assign them few pages to complete on their own. If you’re making these books for your own home, make sure you keep them in an accessible place rather than storage so you can enjoy them more often.

DIY. Go to any craft store and you’ll find that there are so many more creative ways to use and display photos beyond frames and scrapbooks. Buy a big jar of Mod Podge and create playful collages or make ornaments for the Christmas tree. You could also arrange photos under glass on a dresser or desktop to enjoy them in every room.

Delete. After you’ve backed up your collection with digital copies, you can feel better about throwing away printed photos that you didn’t display or use. It’s also important to declutter your digital collection so that it’s easier to find and share photos online. You can safely delete the following from your devices: duplicates; blurry or dark shots; unphotogenic moments you know you will never share or display; and shutter mistakes, like accidental shots of the ceiling or the contents of your purse.",What to do with all of your family photos,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/what-to-do-with-all-your-family-photos.html

In Washington, the ostensible story is rarely the real story. We know, for example, that former President Clinton engineered a meeting with President Obama’s attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on the tarmac of the Phoenix Airport on June 27, 2016.

That’s the official story, replete with the charming and intentionally disarming detail that all they talked about was their grandchildren. It was just coincidental, don’t you know, that at the time the FBI was looking into Hillary Clinton’s use of a “personal” email server to send, receive and store classified information.

And it was also simply coincidental that just a few days later, the director of the FBI – who served under Attorney General Lynch – announced that he wouldn’t recommend a prosecution of Hillary Clinton.

Richard Nixon must be rolling over in his grave.

What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting. In fact, the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous meeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton – but rather on one of the whistleblowers who got the word out.

The organization I head, Judicial Watch, asked the FBI on July 7, 2016, for any records that might pertain to the infamous tarmac meeting. We had to sue after we were ignored by the agency.

Then the FBI told us flat-out that it couldn’t find any records. And we now know that was flat-out untrue. Because, in responding to another one of our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, the Justice Department gave us heavily redacted documents that showed there were additional documents tucked away at the FBI headquarters.",Tom Fitton: New Documents Reveal FBI's Clinton Cover-Up,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/04/tom-fitton-new-documents-reveal-fbis-clinton-cover

Nashville’s Tennessean newspaper reports that Campbell’s 13-page will, dated Sept. 1, 2006, excludes Campbell’s daughter Kelli and sons William Travis and Wesley Kane from benefitting directly from his estate. Campbell was married a total of four times and fathered eight children; the three children excluded from his estate are all from his marriage to his second wife, Billie Jean Nunley, which ended in divorce in 1976.

Prior to that, Campbell was married to Diane Kirk from 1955-1959, a marriage which resulted in his eldest daughter, Debby. Campbell married Mac Davis’ ex-wife, Sarah Barg, in September 1976. The couple had one child named Dillon and divorced in 1980, and after a high-profile relationship with Tanya Tucker, Campbell married Kim Woollen in 1982. They had three children together, Cal, Shannon, and Ashley.

Documents filed in Davidson County Probate Court in Nashville name Kim Campbell as the executor of Campbell’s estimated $50 million estate. The court filing specifically excludes Kelli, William Travis and Wesley Kane from any direct benefit not only from Campbell’s estate, but also a related trust. A hearing on the filing is set for Jan. 18, 2018, which could set the stage for a protracted legal battle over the terms of the will.

Campbell died on Aug. 8, 2017, after battling Alzheimer’s since 2011. His oldest children, Debby and Travis, previously won a legal victory after claiming that Kim Campbell was denying them the right to visit their father during his illness. In May of 2016, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed a bill into law called the Campbell / Falk Act. The law allows family members and close friends of a person with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia or other disabilities to visit a loved one in person, or maintain contact with them by phone, email or mail, despite the stated wishes of a legally appointed conservator.",Glen Campbell's will doesn't include three of his eight children,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/30/glen-campbells-will-doesnt-include-three-his-eight-children.html

The case before our nation’s highest court is called Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The organization that I lead, Alliance Defending Freedom, is representing the cake shop and its owner, cake artist Jack Phillips.

Phillips said he couldn’t design a custom wedding cake for two men who requested it. He declined because using his artistic talents to celebrate a same-sex marriage would violate his Christian faith and his artistic freedom.

The two men then filed a lawsuit against him. But contrary to what they allege, Phillips didn’t discriminate against them. While he can’t create cakes that celebrate what his faith prohibits, he offered to sell the men anything else in his shop or to design a cake for them for another occasion. He serves all people, but can’t express all messages or celebrate all events.

As our nation struggles through deep divisions, we should strive not to use the law as a cudgel against those holding views about marriage that the Supreme Court recently described as “decent and honorable.”

However convinced one may be of the goodness of redefining the meaning of marriage to no longer be only a union between one man and one woman, the First Amendment remains a legal shield for those who aren’t convinced.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that at “the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence.” It is not hyperbole to say, as the high court has, that the American “political system and cultural life rest upon this ideal.”

Since the dawn of the republic, our constitutional order has honored individual freedom of mind and accorded citizens the corresponding liberty to speak and refrain from speaking as their conscience directs. Yet this formerly prized feature of our legal system devoted to individual freedom now faces growing opposition.

Once upon a time, the American Civil Liberties Union cherished a reputation as a champion of the First Amendment, a stalwart defender of free expression rights for dissenting voices. Now it serves as the enforcement arm of the ascendant orthodoxy, prosecuting those who dissent.

In its written brief filed in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, the ACLU denies that the First Amendment offers any refuge to Phillips.

Coercing an artist to custom-design a work of art that celebrates an idea he staunchly disbelieves surely triggers First Amendment protections against compelled expression. But the ACLU insists otherwise. It says that denying Phillips’ artistic freedom is merely “a routine application of a standard public accommodation law.”

Phillips’ decision not to convey a message he disbelieves, to hear the ACLU tell it, is akin to a misogynist hardware store owner refusing to sell hammers or grass seed to women.

But what of the obvious message and expressiveness in the wedding cake itself? The ACLU offers not a word to dispute the exquisite artistry employed in Phillips’ custom designs, nor the expressive symbolism and ceremonial significance of the iconic cake, or the inherently religious celebration in which it plays its central role.

The ACLU merely insists that Phillips’ conscientious denial is but a refusal to transact a “sale” due to a customer’s “status.” Never mind that Phillips will sell anyone anything in his store or that, during their brief 20-second discussion, he offered to create other cakes for the gentlemen who are suing him.

When discussing its clients’ interests, the ACLU decries not their lack of access to custom wedding cakes, but their receiving from Phillips of an unwelcome message of disapproval. In other words, the ACLU doesn’t really deny the profoundly personal and communicative stakes in play. It just doesn’t like the message, so it strives to eliminate such a form of dissent.



As our nation struggles through deep divisions, we should strive not to use the law as a cudgel against those holding views about marriage that the Supreme Court recently described as “decent and honorable.”

Ideally, in a society marked by pluralism on profound issues like the meaning of marriage, a rule of liberty, rather than of strong-arming dissenters to violate their convictions, should prevail.

Carving out space for dissenters is what our country is all about. The ACLU used to cherish that. But in Phillips’ case, it has seemingly placed its preferred policy over that principle.

Jack Phillips seeks merely to live his life and operate his business consistently with the values that he holds dear. That basic liberty is his. It belongs to him as a dissenter from the prevailing views on marriage, just as it belongs to those in the majority.

If the Supreme Court recognizes that in its decision – if it affirms that Phillips is part of our community and that he has a rightful place in the public square – we as a society will move toward a more tolerant position on the deeply divisive moral issue over the meaning of marriage.

Even the ACLU should see the value in more tolerance and less division in today’s America.",Why Masterpiece Cakeshop case could bring a major Supreme Court ruling on free expression,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/04/why-masterpiece-cakeshop-case-could-bring-major-supreme-court-ruling-on-free-expression.html

prev

Wearing nothing but loincloths, a group of boys warm up by climbing sturdy ropes that take them high into the trees. One teenager walks around the wrestling pit swirling incense, blessing the arena and preparing it for battle.

On this November evening, as the dusk thickens and the bugs venture out, a couple of dozen young devotees of kushti, the ancient Indian style of wrestling, have gathered to face off. They range in age from 10 to 16. The earth in the pit has been prepared as it has been for centuries, turned over and mixed with sawdust, turmeric and ghee, or clarified butter. It's mildly fragrant and soft to the touch, making it easier on the wrestlers' skin.

These devotees, or pehelwans, have made a commitment that extends beyond the hours they spend practicing each morning and evening. They live an ascetic lifestyle, eating specific foods like almond milkshakes and chapattis slathered with ghee. They don't eat meat and refrain from smoking, drinking and dating.

The sport, thought to be 2,000 years old, is mentioned in ancient Hindu texts and depicted in temple carvings. Although women wrestlers have made strides recently in India, the vast majority of participants are men.

But like many traditions in a country that's rapidly modernizing, kushti wrestling faces the threat of being left behind. It remains popular in states like Haryana, where these pehelwans are training. For many poor families, wrestling provides a glimmer of hope. Those who succeed can earn money, respect in their communities and even particular jobs. They're often employed by the police force or India's railways.

Fifteen-year-old Ankur Bharadwaj says it's his dream to win an Olympic medal, like his idol Sushil Kumar, who has won two Olympic medals for India in freestyle wrestling. Bharadwag says he gets up at 4 a.m. and jogs to the wrestling pit before going to school.

""Hard work makes a man perfect,"" he says. ""That's why we are practicing so regularly. There are no breaks if you want to be a wrestler.""

Inside the pit, Bharadwaj and the other wrestlers rub their hands with the earth and toss it over their bodies. Under the watchful eye of their coach, they lock arms with their opponents, lunging for their legs as they try to flip them onto their backs and into submission.

The boys aspire to be accepted into an akhada, a kind of wrestling hostel where they're given a bed and can devote themselves to the sport fulltime if they choose. Akhadas come with shrines to the Hindu god Hanuman, who is seen as a kind of patron saint to the sport.

At dawn at a small akhada in the suburbs of Delhi, a man circles the arena dragging a thick piece of wood to smooth the earth. Another crushes almonds with a large mortar and pestle. A poster on the gate advertises a local wrestling bout with a first-place prize of about $3,000. The gate swings open and a cow noses its way inside, breaking into a trot when the wrestlers try to shoo it away.

Coach Hemand Kumar, 35, says wrestling has always been his passion. Even before he started at age 10, he would get up before dawn and watch his father wrestle. The boys who take it up are saved from ""the nonsense"" of the streets, he says. But he worries about the sport's future in a country with a rapidly rising middle class.

""The rich kids, they don't want to do it,"" he says. ""Those people who don't have the money, they're interested. But they don't have the resources.""

Jai Prakash, a former Olympic wrestler who is president of the Delhi Amateur Wrestling Association, says it's getting more difficult to find the land needed to set up new akhadas. And unlike the nation's most popular sport of cricket, he says, it's tough to find sponsors for kushti.

""Wrestling bouts in villages used to be like the festival season, with a joyous mood and crowds celebrating victories of their favorite wrestlers,"" he says.

Still, he's upbeat about the future of the sport, which is also known as pehlwani. He says wrestling authorities want to make kushti a part of some international wrestling competitions, something he hopes might begin next year.

At the renowned Guru Hanuman Akhara in Delhi there are about 25 resident pehelwans, most of them hulking men in their 20s and early 30s. Some train with giant clubs that they swing behind their backs. Others grab a rope that's threaded through a pulley and haul into the air a bucket that's filled with concrete.

Sitting in a chair watching the men practice is Naveen Mor, who has won a number of international wrestling fixtures, including a gold medal at the 2011 World Police and Fire Games in New York. He says his wrestling prowess helped him land a job with the Haryana state police, where he works as an inspector.

Like many Indian wrestlers, Mor started in the pit and later became proficient wrestling on a mat, which provides the standard arena for most international bouts.

He says his first love remains the pit, where bouts can sometimes last an hour until somebody finally gives up.

As he cuts back on competitions and does more coaching, Mor says he still follows the strict dietary rules of kushti, although he is more relaxed about other rules and has recently gotten married.

He says he doesn't regret dedicating his youth to the sport.

""No working. No shopping,"" he says with a grin. ""Only wrestling, wrestling, wrestling. My life is wrestling. I love wrestling.""

How is it possible that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal indictment for mishandling classified documents despite incriminating evidence that she violated the Espionage Act?

Why did Donald Trump become the target of a criminal investigation for allegedly conspiring with Russia to influence the presidential election despite no evidence that he ever did so?

The answer, it seems, comes down to one person who played a vital role in both cases: Peter Strzok, deputy director of counterintelligence at the FBI.

Strzok was exchanging politically charged texts with an FBI lawyer that denigrated Trump and lauded Clinton at the same time he was leading the bureau’s criminal investigation of Clinton. He is also the one who changed the critical wording of then-FBI Director James Comey’s description of Clinton’s handling of classified material that resulted in no charges being brought against her.

Then, Strzok reportedly signed the document launching the 2016 investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether the Trump campaign played any role. After leading the FBI’s probe into Trump, he then joined Robert Mueller’s special counsel team as an integral investigator.

Thus, it appears that one man with a strident political agenda accomplished his twin goals of clearing Clinton and accusing Trump, evidence be damned.

And then he was caught.

The Strzok Bust and Cover-up

The Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, discovered the electronic texts Strzok exchanged with his lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. The messages were so politically incendiary and so threatened the integrity of Mueller’s investigation that Strzok was quietly canned over the summer from the special counsel team, where he was a pivotal participant.","Gregg Jarrett: How an FBI Official with a Political Agenda Corrupted Both Mueller, Comey Investigations",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/06/gregg-jarrett-how-fbi-official-political-agenda-corrupted-both-mueller-comey#commenting

Beside Moore on the ballot is Doug Jones, a pro-abortion candidate who generally supports the policies associated with his party’s secular progressive platform.

Should the good Republicans of Alabama vote for Moore, for Jones, or for a write-in candidate?

Should conservatives across the nation support Moore or speak out against his candidacy?

GOP leaders are divided.

Some Republican leaders support Moore’s candidacy. President Trump, for example, supports Moore because, “The future of this country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate.” Similarly, Alabama’s governor Kay Ivey argues that significant policy issues are more important than Moore’s past.

Other Republican leaders argue unequivocally that Alabamans should disown Moore. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, declared that “Roy Moore will never have the support of the senatorial committee. We will never endorse him. We won’t support him.” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says that Moore will “immediately” face a Senate Ethics Committee probe should he win. Speaker Paul Ryan has repeatedly called for Moore to drop out of the race.

What is best for our nation, for vulnerable women, and for the Republican party?

But GOP leaders are not the only people who must make up their minds about Moore. The good people of Alabama must cast their votes, and conservatives across the nation must make our voices heard on this matter of national significance.

Let’s face it: the Roy Moore situation is a sticky wicket.

Moore denies all charges, repeatedly declaring that he does not know the women and that the charges are malicious. And although Moore has not undergone trial and been found guilty, Americans do not have the luxury of waiting for a trial before the election is held. We must make a decision now, however tentative our judgment might be.



The weight of the evidence is against Moore. The testimony of the women seems generally persuasive. At least nine accusers have given their names and exposed themselves to tough questioning, knowing their testimony would cause them pain and public harassment. At least four of the women are Trump supporters, Republicans, or vocally devout Christians. Additionally, there are at least thirty persons who have corroborated details of the accusations.

On the one hand, if we do not support Moore, the nation will be stuck with a pro-abortion Democrat whose votes will line up fairly well with the secular progressive agenda. We will be giving ground to media outlets and personalities who have slighted conservatives and mocked us for decades. We might find ourselves with one less vote during the next Supreme Court Justice confirmation. Adding insult to injury, we’ll have to live with the knowledge that today’s left-wing moralists are yesterday’s supporters of Harasser-in-Chief Bill Clinton.

On the other hand, if we do support Moore, the short-term victory will come at a considerable cost to vulnerable women, our own integrity, and the long-term health of the GOP. The moment Moore is seated, his situation almost assuredly will be investigated by the Ethics Committee and might eventuate in a vote to censure or expel him. During mid-term elections, news media “will hang him around the neck of every Republican candidate as Democrats try to drive turnout” among women, independents, and younger voters who rightly think that personal character matters for public office.

Although a substantive case can be made for supporting Moore, the right thing is to withdraw support for his candidacy and send a resounding message to the nation.

In the words of Founding Father Noah Webster, “When a citizen gives his vote to a man of known immorality, he abuses his civic responsibility [and] betrays the interest of his country.”

In the words of Proverbs 14:34, “Righteousness exalts a nation.”

Although a public official’s private life does not always bear on his public office, and although public officials should not be held to unreasonable moral standards, the accusations against Moore are serious. If they are true, he preyed on the unprotected, treating them as objects or instruments of sexual gratification. And if so, he has not confessed or repented and thus his morally and legally indefensible acts should be politically devastating also.

Now is not the time for the GOP to change its long-standing conviction that personal character matters for public office. Now is not the time to send a message to younger voters, women, and independents that morality no longer matters in the GOP. Now is not the time to forsake all credibility in our rebukes of Kennedy, Clinton, Weinstein, Lauer, Franken, and others.

It is possible that Moore is innocent. I have always respected him personally and hope that, against appearances, he is vindicated. And yet, even if he is later shown to be innocent, support for him now would send the wrong signal in light of the overwhelming public perception that he is guilty.

What is best for our nation, for vulnerable women, and for the Republican party?

To embrace and act on the conviction that personal character matters for public office, that we will not elect to office candidates of whom there are serious questions or allegations concerning their respect for women, and that we are willing to write in a candidate, knowing that we will experience a short-term electoral setback in order to sustain our long-term integrity and viability.

Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr’s duties – including whether she worked on the dossier – remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects. HPSCI staff confirmed to Fox News that she was paid by Fusion GPS through the summer and fall of 2016.

Fusion GPS has attracted scrutiny because Republican lawmakers have spent the better part of this year investigating whether the dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, served as the basis for the Justice Department and the FBI to obtain FISA surveillance last year on a Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page.

“The House Intelligence Committee,” Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News in a statement on Monday, “is looking into all facets of the connections between the Department of Justice and Fusion GPS, including Mr. Ohr.”

Until Dec. 6, when Fox News began making inquiries about him, Bruce Ohr held two titles at DOJ. He was, and remains, director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force; but his other job was far more senior. Mr. Ohr held the rank of associate deputy attorney general, a post that gave him an office four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The day before Fox News reported that Mr. Ohr held his secret meetings last year with the founder of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled the dossier, the Justice Department stripped Ohr of his deputy title and ousted him from his fourth floor office at the building that DOJ insiders call “Main Justice.”

The Department of Justice has provided no public explanation for Ohr’s demotion. Officials inside the Department have told Fox News his wearing of two hats was “unusual,” but also confirm Ohr had withheld his contacts with the Fusion GPS men from colleagues at the DOJ.

Former FBI Director James Comey has described the dossier as a compendium of “salacious and unverified” allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump and his associates, including Page, a foreign policy adviser. The dossier was provided to the FBI in July 2016, shortly before then-candidate Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination. As Comey later testified, it was in that same month that the FBI began a counterintelligence probe of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

The disclosure by Fox News that Bruce Ohr met with Simpson and Steele last year expanded the reach of the dossier’s creators from the FBI into the top echelons of the Justice Department. Initial investigation suggested that Steele, a longtime FBI informant whose contacts with Mr. Ohr are said to date back a decade, might have played the central role in putting Simpson together with the associate deputy attorney general. Now, the revelation that Mrs. Ohr worked for Simpson calls that account into question.

A review of open source materials shows Mrs. Ohr was described as a Russia expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, when she worked there, briefly, a decade ago. The Center’s website said her project focused on the experiences of Russian farmers during Stalin’s collectivization program and following the invasion of Russia by Nazi forces in 1941. She has also reviewed a number of books about twentieth century Russia, including Reconstructing the State: Personal Networks and Elite Identity in Soviet Russia (2000), by Gerald Easter, a political scientist at Boston College, and Bertrand M. Patenaude’s The Big Show in Bololand: The American Relief Expedition to Soviet Russia in the Famine of 1921 (2002).

Contacted by Fox News late Monday, DOJ officials declined to comment.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, declined to comment on the original disclosure about Mr. Ohr’s secret meetings, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mrs. Ohr.

While Nunes has issued numerous subpoenas to DOJ and FBI relating to the dossier, and has threatened contempt-of-Congress citations against Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray for what congressional Republicans have termed “stonewalling” by the two agencies, Schiff has mostly objected to the demands for documents and witnesses, casting the entire dossier probe as innately political. “I think there's a hope that if they can impeach Christopher Steele, and they can impeach the FBI and DOJ, maybe they can impeach the whole Russia investigation,” Schiff told MSNBC in September.

In less than five months, the true test of President Trump’s staying power in the Rust Belt will finally be here. A House seat in southwestern Pennsylvania, which voted solidly for Trump in 2016, is up for grabs in a special election on March 13.

Republican Tim Murphy held this seat for 10 years until it was revealed that the politician, who is married and pro-life, asked his mistress to consider an abortion in the midst of a pregnancy scare. The news prompted a national scandal and his ouster this fall.

Now, the first post-Trump election in Appalachia is approaching, and the result could signal how the crucial 2018 midterms will be decided next year.

Adriana, who didn't want to use her last name, is one of the hundreds of children who were victims of the country’s “Dirty War.”

With the help of the group Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, she was able to match her DNA to the relatives of her parents, who disappeared under Argentina’s military rule, the BBC reported.

Adriana is the 126th child identified by the group.

According to records, Adriana is the daughter of Violeta Ortolani, 23, and Edgardo Garnier, 21, who were part of a left-wing student group in the city of La Plata.

Ortolani was detained by military in December 1976 when she was eight months pregnant. Adriana was born in captivity a month later.

""Love is stronger than hate, always."" - Adriana

Garnier was detained in early 1977 while he was searching for Ortolani. They were never seen again.

Some 30,000 people disappeared during the period of brutal military rule between 1976 and 1983.

Adriana told reporters Tuesday that when the couple who raised her passed away, she was told that she was not their biological child. It got her thinking maybe she was a missing child from the “Dirty War.”

“I found out on a Saturday, and on the Monday, I had already gone to the Grandmothers, I wanted to know if I was the daughter of people who disappeared, more than anything because of the date of my birth,” she said.

On Monday, four months after taking the DNA test, the National Commission for the Right to Identity called saying they had information. She said that during a lot of the waiting period she began to think her parents had abandoned her.

However, she said she discovered she was “a person that was wanted, searched for and I have a beautiful family.”

“I have a grandmother at 40 years old, I cannot believe it,” Adriana said. “Today I got to speak with her and I love her. They showed me a photo of her and she is beautiful. She is beautiful inside and out. Love is stronger than hate, always.”

The media echo chamber spent the week speculating about whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller can or will nab President Trump on obstruction-of-justice charges. All the while it continues to ignore Washington’s most obvious obstruction—the coordinated effort to thwart congressional probes of the role law enforcement played in the 2016 election.

The news that senior FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text messages with another FBI official matters—though we’ve yet to see the content. The bigger scandal is that the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mr. Mueller have known about those texts for months and deliberately kept their existence from Congress. The House Intelligence Committee sent document subpoenas and demanded an interview with Mr. Strzok. The Justice Department dodged, and then leaked.

The department also withheld from Congress that another top official, Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, was in contact with ex-spook Christopher Steele and the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. It has refused to say what role the Steele dossier—Clinton-commissioned oppo research—played in its Trump investigation. It won’t turn over files about its wiretapping.

And Mr. Mueller—who is well aware the House is probing all this, and considered the Strzok texts relevant enough to earn the agent a demotion—nonetheless did not inform Congress about the matter. Why? Perhaps Mr. Mueller feels he’s above being bothered with any other investigation. Or perhaps his team is covering for the FBI and the Justice Department.

When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller, he stressed that he wanted a probe with “independence from the normal chain of command.” Yet the Mueller team is made up of the same commanders who were previously running the Trump show at the Justice Department and the FBI, and hardly distant from their old office.

Andrew Weissmann, Mr. Mueller’s deputy, is chief of the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section and was once FBI general counsel.

As a professional home organizer, I work with many clients who are on a quest to pare down their possessions to create a tranquil home where they can relax and recharge. Often, we look together at inspirational photos of minimalistic homes with floor-to-ceiling windows, clean-lined furniture and muted color palettes.

But remodeling, or buying all new furniture, simply to achieve a minimalist look somehow seems to defeat the purpose of paring back in the first place. Here’s how to take the lessons of minimalism and apply them in your home, no matter its style.

The Essence of Minimalism

We’ve written about minimalism in the past and identified several key elements to getting this look, including clutter control, clean furnishings, limited palettes and bare windows. In a nutshell, minimalism in interior design means creating a sense of spaciousness in rooms (no matter their square footage) using a minimum of furniture and details. Though most of us associate minimalism with modern furniture that has clean, straight lines, minimalism truly can be achieved with any decor style.

RELATED: Learn How to Calculate Your Square Footage From a Pro

A Practical Road Map

Take these basic steps to imbue your room with a minimalist feel.

1. Remove excess clutter. Removing clutter is the first step to creating a minimalistic home. If you do not truly love or need something, perhaps it is time to let it go. For most of us, this is easier said than done. To get you motivated, I recommend saving inspiring photos of beautiful and decluttered spaces in a Houzz ideabook, as well as reading The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo. The hardest part of this process is deciding what to keep and what to let go. If necessary, enlist the help of a friend or professional home organizer to assist you in achieving your goals.

2. Use a muted color palette. White is a common paint choice in minimalism, as are muted tones of gray, cream and beige. Fresh paint is a relatively inexpensive way to change the look of a room, and I recommend considering a matte finish so that walls do not appear shiny.

If your budget allows for some redecorating, you may want to use similar colors for walls, window treatments, upholstery and flooring to give a room a cohesive, tranquil appearance. To give the room more depth, you can vary the textures and materials you choose. If replacing furniture and decor items does not fit your plans, consider simply toning down your palette by limiting colors and patterns. Paring down the number of items can also help infuse a more restful mood.

3. Add an intense pop of color. Although not necessary, a small touch of vivid color can look fantastic in an otherwise muted room. Consider limiting bright colors to a few pillows, small decor pieces or a small accent wall, all of which I recommend you keep in the same color.

4. Choose large wall decor. Consider limiting to one large picture or mirror to hang on the wall, instead of several smaller items grouped together. This will prevent the room from appearing too busy.

5. Avoid overcrowding. Blank walls and empty corners work well in the minimalist aesthetic, so don’t stuff your room too fully. Also avoid heavy-looking furniture, as well as too many small pieces. In fact, you don’t even need an area rug. Keep decorative pillows, throws and coffee table decor to a minimum.

6. Embrace the outdoors. If privacy is not a concern, consider going without window treatments to bring the outdoors in. If your budget allows, you might install solar shades to block out excess sun. Ideally, they’ll be barely noticeable while they protect your furniture and artwork from harmful rays.

How to Get the Benefits of Minimalism in Your Home

You do not have to purchase all new furniture to embrace minimalism — simply apply the ideas we’ve just explored to your existing furnishings, in your favorite decorating style.

Cottage. Often a country- or cottage-style home can become overrun with adornment and decor. If it is not in your budget to replace your country-style furniture, consider covering couches with neutral or white slipcovers and keeping decorative objects to a minimum. White walls can also tone down your country look.

Industrial. Industrial style lends itself well to minimalism with its sleek lines and muted colors. But the key to a truly minimalistic kitchen, no matter your style, is to stow small appliances away and keep counters and tabletops free of clutter.",Transform your home into a relaxing retreat with these minimalist tactics,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/12/04/transform-your-home-into-relaxing-retreat-with-these-minimalist-tactics.html

They say the key to organization is a place for everything and everything in its place. This is true for even the smallest items, such as your kitchen utensils. These include your everyday flatware as well as the many small but mighty cooking tools a serious chef requires. Here are some of my favorite options for storing your utensils, in any space and on any budget.

Step One: Eliminating

Before you can organize any part of your home properly, you need to do some culling, and this is especially true in the kitchen. Drawers can quickly become filled with unused tools and gadgets, so take a hard look at the items you own and find as many as possible to give away or box up.

You may never get your collection of utensils down to the perfectly minimal arrangements, but the more items you can eliminate, the easier it will be to store and find the truly useful ones. Never use the little dessert spoons that came with your cutlery set? Only used that special spatula (designed to perfectly flip a single egg) the one time? Stash these items away in less reachable spaces such as upper cabinets to free up more prime cabinet real estate.

If Renovating, Make a Plan for Success

If you’re renovating or building a kitchen, you shouldn’t put off the organizational considerations until all the construction is complete. Thinking in advance about how to hold your collection of tools will produce a much better result. Planning to include a few drawers specifically sized for utensils will save a lot of potentially wasted space.

Typical cutlery trays aren’t very wide. Your basic eating utensils get used every day, but they don’t need that much space. A drawer just 10 to 12 inches wide will provide the right amount of space for those items without the need to have them share space with whisks and ladles.

Give depth some (deep) thought. Besides considering the width of the drawers, don’t forget to think about the depth. Drawers are often 6 to 8 inches deep (on the exterior face) by default simply because the cabinet has been split evenly into three to four drawers. However, a 4- to 5-inch-deep drawer (again, on the face, which translates to just a few inches inside) is all you need to store well-organized utensils. Using more and shallower drawers keeps items from getting piled on top of each other and lost in the mix.

Ideally, you should look at the collection of utensils you have (or plan to have) and map out exactly how much space they will need. This takes some extra effort upfront, but you will end up with a much better allocation of space than by simply choosing drawers in an arbitrary width. You can try laying out your utensils on a dining table to get a visual picture (and some measurements) of how much space they ideally would get.

Mix drawers and doors. Often people think of drawer cabinets and basic shelf cabinets as being two separate things, but they definitely can be mixed to meet your needs more efficiently.

Cabinets with a drawer at the top and doors and shelves below allow smaller, often-used items to be placed at a more reachable height, with the shelf storage left for more occasional items and oversized pieces. If you use lots of small chef’s tools when you cook, consider including many utensil drawers at the top level. It will save you a lot of bending down over time.

Consider going vertical. Want to tidy up your cutlery drawer without having to assign each piece an individual place? Try a drawer with vertical cutlery bins that let you simply drop in pieces with long handles (such as spatulas and slotted spoons) and pull them out easily. You’ll be able to see each piece, and you won’t have to remember exactly where you got it later.

You can store flatware vertically too. Cleverly retrofit a deeper drawer into a cutlery drawer by dividing it into small, deep compartments Just be sure you don’t store sharp items this way, or you may dull the blades (and risk accidents as well).

Create layers. Another way to make the best use of deep drawers is to break them up internally into layers. You can either use a built-in drawer divider system or find a layered drop-in unit.

RELATED: Shop Drawer Dividers for Your Kitchen Space

A tiered organizer can create compartments smaller than an individual drawer to gain maximum space efficiency. Just keep in mind that the upper layer will partially cover the lower layer (or will need to be slid individually), so you should put the most-used items on the most reachable tier.

Retrofitting: What Are the Options?

Single trays. A classic single cutlery tray is sometimes all you need, but keep in mind that these trays are not truly one-size-fits-all. Finding one that comes close to filling your drawer width will provide more structure versus a small tray that shifts around with use. Measure the interior of your drawer and look for a tray that fills it. Online shops will usually have more size options than a small local kitchen supply store.

Configurable trays. A step above the prefabricated single trays is a divider system made up of single compartments that can be mixed and matched like Tetris pieces to create spaces for all your items. If you can’t perfectly fill the full width, use the open space for a sturdy item such as a rolling pin or box of foil that will keep the other pieces from shifting.

Resizable dividers. Another step closer to a custom built-in is a resizable divider system that lets you snap together pieces to create any size compartments you like. An advantage of this sort of system is that you can change the configuration later to fit a different mix of items, or even fit a new drawer if you move or renovate.

Open storage vessels. For those who don’t mind having some of their utensils on display, simple open vessels or jars make a great place to hold your often-used items.

This can look especially great in a kitchen that makes use of open shelving already, with the utensil jars becoming part of the overall chef’s kitchen appeal.

Hanging rails. Another form of open storage is a rail that can be used to either hang utensils and tools directly (via a curved handle or a hook) or hang containers and holders to keep your utensils within easy reach but off the counter.

A wall-mounted system can be great for stealing a little storage space behind the range or elsewhere on the backsplash, which can be a lifesaver in a compact kitchen where every inch of storage space counts.

Pegboards. Like a rail, a pegboard can give you lots of flexible storage space on the wall. Whether this look is charmingly relaxed or too busy is a matter of personal taste, but if you like this aesthetic, it offers lots of practical options for arranging and rearranging your tools.",Storage 101: How to store kitchen tools and flatware,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/22/storage-101-how-to-store-kitchen-tools-and-flatware.html

It was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
“Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,” according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.
In January, McCain officially gave the dossier to the FBI, which already had its own copy from Steele.
Fusion GPS and Kramer did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.","The man who says he acted as a “go-between” last year to inform Sen. John McCain about the controversial “dossier” containing salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump is speaking out, revealing how the ex-British spy who researched the document helped coordinate its release to the FBI, the media and Capitol Hill.

“My mission was essentially to be a go-between and a messenger, to tell the senator and assistants that such a dossier existed,” Sir Andrew Wood told Fox News in an exclusive interview with senior executive producer Pamela K. Browne.

Fox News spoke to Wood at the 2017 Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada. As Britain’s ambassador to Moscow from 1995-2000, Wood witnessed the end of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the rise of Vladimir Putin.

Just after the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, Arizona GOP Sen. McCain spoke at the same security conference. Wood says he was instructed — by former British spy Christopher Steele — to reach out to the senior Republican, whom Wood called “a good man,” about the unverified document.

Wood insists that he’s never read the dossier that his good friend and longtime colleague prepared. It was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

In August 2016, “[Steele] came to me to tell me what was in it, and why it … was important,” Wood said. “He made it very clear … yes, it was raw intelligence, but it needed putting into proper context before you could judge it fully.”

August 2016 is a critical period, just after the FBI opened the Russia meddling probe, and after then-director James Comey recommended against prosecution for Clinton’s mishandling of classified information.

Wood said Steele had “already been in contact with the FBI” at the time.

“He said there was corroborating evidence in the United States, from which I assumed he was working with an American company,” Wood said.

British court records reviewed by Fox News as well as U.S. congressional testimony revealed that Steele was directed and paid at least $168,000 by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson to push the research that fall to five American media outlets. According to British court documents, Steele met with The New York Times (twice), The Washington Post (twice), CNN, The New Yorker and Yahoo News (twice).

“Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,” according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.

Wood said he’d heard of Fusion GPS, as the group Steele was working with, but had “never heard of Mr. Simpson.”

Three weeks after Trump won the presidential election, at the Canadian security conference, the details were finalized for the dossier hand-off to McCain.

Along with the senator, Wood and McCain Institute for International Leadership staffer David J. Kramer attended the Canadian conference.

British court records state McCain ordered Kramer to get a personal briefing from Steele in Surrey, just outside of London, and then return to Washington, D.C., where Fusion GPS would provide McCain with hard copies.

In January, McCain officially gave the dossier to the FBI, which already had its own copy from Steele.

Of note, listed in the official program for the 2016 November Canadian conference as a participant was Rinat Akhmetshin — the same Russian lobbyist who was at Trump Tower five months earlier in June for a highly scrutinized meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and others.

The senator’s office noted to Fox News that McCain said in January 2017 he had no contact with Akhmetshin. “Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.”

It is not known whether Akhmetshin had any contact with Kramer. Fusion GPS and Kramer did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.

End of the road for Cassini

NASA’s Cassini spacecraft made its dramatic ‘death plunge’ into Saturn’s atmosphere Sept. 15, ending an epic 20-year space journey.

As expected, Cassini made its final signal to Earth around 7:55 a.m. EDT. Travelling at about 70,000 mph, the orbiter broke up just seconds later.

GOODBYE CASSINI: NASA SPACECRAFT MAKES 'DEATH PLUNGE' INTO SATURN’S ATMOSPHERE

With Cassini low on fuel, scientists opted to destroy the spacecraft rather than leaving the orbiter to drift around space.

The spacecraft, which spent 13 years exploring the Saturn system, generated a trove of scientific data on Saturn and its moons. Earlier this year, NASA announced that Saturn’s moon Enceladus could support life thanks to the discovery of hydrogen.

Rosetta made its slow-motion crash into comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Sept. 30 2016, marking the end of an audacious 12-year mission.

A year of volcanic activity

The eyes of the world have recently been on Bali’s erupting Mount Agung. Indonesian authorities ordered 100,000 people to evacuate from areas close to the erupting volcano on the popular vacation island. Ash clouds also forced the closure of the island’s airport.

The last major eruption at Mount Agung was 54 years ago and left a trail of destruction in its wake, causing more than 1,100 fatalities. The 1963 eruption was categorized as Volcanic Explosivity Index 5, placing it at the same level as the Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D. and Mount St. Helens in 1980.

BALI VOLCANO: WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE LAST MAJOR ERUPTION AT MOUNT AGUNG?

Indonesia is part of the so-called called “Pacific Ring of Fire” where the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates are pushed under the Eurasian plate. As a result, the nation is the most volcanically active the planet.

Supervolcanoes have also been in the news this year. In June, the supervolcano at Yellowstone National Park was hit with 464 earthquakes in one week, although scientists from the University of Utah said that the swarm was nothing to be worried about.

464 EARTHQUAKES IN ONE WEEK HIT MUCH FEARED YELLOWSTONE 'SUPERVOLCANO'

Experts from Arizona State University also analyzed minerals around the Yellowstone supervolcano, which brought them to the conclusion that the volcano could blow much faster than previously expected. However, the researchers noted that it is not expected to blow anytime soon. If it did, the event would not be catastrophic, they added.

VOLCANOES KILL ABOUT 540 PEOPLE A YEAR, SCIENTISTS SAY

The supervolcano’s last major eruption was 630,000 years ago.

Digging history

2017 has been a busy year for archaeologists. Scientific tests, for example, recently offered fascinating new insight into the tomb in Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre venerated as the resting place of Jesus Christ.

National Geographic reported that construction materials used on the tomb have been dated to the Roman era. The results of tests provided to the publication confirm that the remains of a limestone cave enshrined in the famous church are the remnants of a tomb found by the Romans 1,700 years ago.

NEW EVIDENCE DATES CHRIST’S TOMB TO ROMAN ERA, MATCHING HISTORICAL RECORDS

The findings are significant because, up until now, the earliest architectural evidence around the cave complex dated it to the Crusader period, which would make it about 1,000 years old.

Other archaeological sites in the Middle East have also been in the headlines. At the site of an ancient city on the West Bank, for example, archaeologists are hunting for evidence of the tabernacle that once housed the Ark of the Covenant.

EXPERTS HUNT FOR BIBLICAL TABERNACLE THAT HOUSED THE ARK OF THE COVENANT

Other experts believe they have found the lost Roman city of Julias, formerly the village of Bethsaida, which was the home of Jesus' apostles Peter, Andrew and Philip.

Earlier this month, experts in Egypt announced that they had discovered a mysterious chamber inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza.

DNA breakthrough

In a major scientific breakthrough, researchers harnessed a gene-editing tool to correct a disease-causing gene mutation in human embryos, preventing the mutation from passing to future generations.

In the stunning discovery, a research team led by Oregon Health and Science University reported that embryos can fix themselves if scientists jump-start the process early enough.

DNA BREAKTHROUGH: SCIENTISTS REPAIR GENES IN HUMAN EMBRYOS TO PREVENT INHERITED DISEASES

The new technique, which was tested on clinical-quality human eggs, uses the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool to target a mutation in nuclear DNA that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, according to the researchers. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic heart disease that can cause heart failure and sudden cardiac death.

CRISPR has been compared to a pair of “molecular scissors” that lets scientists alter or replace specific sections of DNA.

GENE EDITING BREAKTHROUGH COULD PAVE WAY FOR PIG-TO-HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANTS

This year, scientists also harnessed gene-editing technology to eliminate viruses in pigs that could be harmful to people, potentially laying the foundations for pig-to-human organ transplants. Researchers from biotech company eGenesis used CRISPR-Cas9 to produce pigs lacking active Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV).

Mei Rui, a concert pianist and cancer researcher, was on her way to New York City to take part in a recording session for a clinical cancer study, The Washington Post reports. Trouble began when the 6:30 a.m. flight was repeatedly delayed due to an “insufficient de-icing solution,” Rui wrote in a now-deleted post on Facebook.

“Every parent with a young child can [imagine], you don’t want to be that parent on the plane,” she told the Post. “It would be very embarrassing. I was just trying to avoid that.”

Rui claims a crew member asked her to stop breastfeeding and buckle her son into his seat before takeoff. She wrote that the airplane door was still open and asked the attendant for a few more minutes to finish nursing her son before the doors closed. However, a representative for the airline said reports confirm that the door was already closed at this time.

“I explained to them both that giving me a couple more minutes to finish nursing him would prevent him from crying and disturbing the other passengers. Seeing that I did not stop breastfeeding him promptly, they went back and at that point must have called the captain. I didn’t want to cause any trouble, so I immediately pulled my son off and forced-buckled him into the seat, which set off uncontrollable crying for the next 25 minutes to the great dismay and earache of everyone on the plane,” Rui wrote on Facebook.

She and her family were then allegedly asked to leave the plane, where they were met by airline staff and airport security who told her they would not be allowed back on board. “It’s not like I was resistant, I put him in the seat,” she told The Post. “If they had shown a little compassion, it wouldn’t have happened, they didn’t have to let it escalate.”

Rui recorded the encounter on her cell phone, where she can be heard over her crying son, asking what she had done wrong. “I just want to know why we were kicked off the plane.” Rui said.

“Because you were not compliant,” a Spirit employee said.

“Could you tell me which part of the instruction we were not compliant with? I think we deserve to know that.”

The employee refused to provide any details.

“If this happened to your family...” Rui said.

“It wouldn’t happen to my family, I can assure you,” he said.

Spirit’s Director of Communications, Stephen Schuler, told Fox News that Rui was not removed for breastfeeding but instead for failure “to comply with crew instructions by not being safely buckled and secured for takeoff after being asked repeatedly to do so.”

“We were forced to remove a passenger from flight 712 after they refused to comply with crew instructions several times while the doors were closed during taxi and safety briefing.

The underground railroad wasn’t actually a railroad. It was a series of safe houses – “stations” they were called – that provided refuge to escaped slaves from the South risking their lives to seek the freedom that was their God-given human right. They often traveled at night and on foot – never knowing if they would be captured and enslaved once again.

Imagine, if you can, stepping into the shoes of an escaped slave – if they had shoes, that is. Imagine summoning up the courage to walk up the back steps of one of those safe houses.

Trembling, you knock on the door. Fear and hope fill your racing heart. When the person on the other side opens the door you wrestle the passwords from your lips: “A friend of a friend sent me.”

You hope beyond hope that the person opening the door is truly a friend, and that the door will be another step on your road to freedom. You hope the person will provide you with refuge – and not a whip, or chains, or a bullet.

While at the safe house, we had the opportunity to read some of the stories of the escaped slaves recorded by William Still, one of the founders of the underground railroad.

One of the stories hit a chord with me because it was about a mother I could readily identify with. The woman was named Betsy, a slave who fled to freedom because her baby boy almost died one day while she was laboring in the field of her master. Think about that word – her master. Someone who owned her as if she was a dog instead of a human being.

It’s a daunting thing to consider that truly was a reality for many who looked very much like me and my two beautiful black babies. I don’t know what this feels like. Not one black American alive today knows what this feels like.

Betsy wanted the freedom to care for her baby and she wanted her son to grow up in freedom, instead of worrying that he would be taken from her and sold to the highest bidder at an auction. This brave woman, in her heart, wanted what I and every mother wants – the best for our children.

So what does this all have to do with today – particularly for the lives of black Americans?

Betsy was a slave. Her whole environment told her she was not even human. She had no rights. At any moment, her master could radically change her situation and she would be able to do nothing about it. Yet, she was not helpless. She would not succumb to “white privilege.” She and her posterity would be free.

As we look at the culture around us today, the agitation is palpable. We see this growing intensity behind the narrative that black lives are in danger, that black people are victims and that white privilege is the culprit. Innocent lives are being lost, blood is being spilled and opportunities are being wasted.

There may be those in very high places who are constantly telling you that you’re a victim, that it’s someone else’s fault, that you can’t achieve this or that because the odds are stacked against you. Ignore them.

My message to my fellow black Americans is simple: There may be those in very high places who are constantly telling you that you’re a victim, that it’s someone else’s fault, that you can’t achieve this or that because the odds are stacked against you. Ignore them.

We are not slaves! We are free! I am not a victim, my children are not victims, and all black people are no longer victims. We are smart, talented, hardworking and have the same legal rights as all other Americans.

We have received a great inheritance from our strong and proud ancestors. We are victors. You have not been fatally wounded. Remember that.

If Betsy could succeed, you can succeed. Learn from our shared history of struggle, study hard and work hard and write a story of triumph over adversity that your grandchildren and great grandchildren will be proud to read.

You can be more than your environment. Just believe. And may God bless America, where the beautiful ideals of the Declaration of Independence are belatedly but finally accepted and embraced by our great nation.",The nightmare of slavery should make us appreciate the blessings of today,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/10/nightmare-slavery-should-make-us-appreciate-blessings-today.html

“Unless Don Lemon is a LOT younger than he appears to be, this is a tone-deaf overreach.","CNN has accused President Trump of bullying Don Lemon in a tweet that called the polarizing anchor the “dumbest man on television.”

Trump slammed The New York Times on Monday morning over what he called a “false” story claiming he watches up to eight hours of television a day – while taking yet another swipe at CNN and MSNBC. The Times article detailed Trump’s “hour-by-hour battle for self-preservation,” describing how he sometimes “hate-watches” CNN’s Lemon.

“Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

CNN quickly issued a statement, accusing Trump of bullying the 51-year-old anchor.

“In a world where bullies torment kids on social media to devastating effect on a regular basis with insults and name calling, it is sad to see our president engaging in the very same behavior himself. Leaders should lead by example,” CNN said.

Former CNN political analyst Jeff Greenfield isn’t a fan of CNN’s statement and mocked his old network.

“Unless Don Lemon is a LOT younger than he appears to be, this is a tone-deaf overreach. From what I've seen, Lemon--unlike bullied kids whose school officials ignore the issue--is more than capable of standing up for himself. This almost infantilizes him,” he tweeted.

Fox News contributor Stephen Miller joked, “CNN just compared themselves to a crying kid in a car and they think that's the high road.”

President Trump has an ongoing feud with CNN, which has essentially implemented an anti-Trump programming strategy. As a result, the president often refers to CNN as “fake news” and the network has launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to shake that moniker with a “Facts First” initiative.

CNN had to issue an embarrassing correction on Friday when the Washington Post debunked the network's report claiming the Trump campaign had early, secret access to hacked DNC emails from WikiLeaks. The network on Friday inaccurately trumpeted that Congressional investigators obtained a mysterious 2016 email that was sent to Trump and other top aides, including Donald Trump Jr., which contained information on how to get a sneak peek at hacked information that WikiLeaks had acquired. The email, as CNN reported, offered a “decryption key” to access the files – but the network botched the date on the email, rendering the entire report irrelevant.

In addition, CNN on Monday gently backpedaled a report from earlier this year that bashed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for failing to disclose meetings he had with Russian officials when he applied for his security clearance – but it turns out he wasn’t required to.",CNN ridiculed for accusing Trump of bullying ‘dumbest man on television’ Don Lemon,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/11/cnn-accuses-trump-bullying-dumbest-man-on-television-don-lemon.html

People who see standing for the national anthem as a non-negotiable way of paying respect to veterans have been feuding with those who support the rights of NFL players to protest racial injustice and police brutality during the anthem.

The Bob Woodruff Foundation, where I serve as executive director, is a manifestly nonpartisan organization. Operating this way has allowed us to successfully invest more than $45 million in finding, funding and shaping programs that empower veterans, service members and their families across the country.

However, outrage over the national anthem is an item we felt we needed to examine more carefully. The issue has thrust veterans, and respect for them, into the public discourse. We would be remiss not to take the country’s pulse on the subject.

Our commitment to veterans has long strengthened our country and reinforced the values of our communities, and it can continue to bind us moving forward.

In a survey we fielded in November to 800 Americans ages 18 and up, the statement “veterans make this country great” was the most readily agreed upon of the statements we put forth.

In fact, 74 percent of respondents agreed, and only 10 percent disagreed. Levels of agreement were consistent across regions, with 75 percent agreement in the South, 74 percent in the Center-Great Lakes and 73 percent in both the East and the West regions.

If anything, the dialogue around the NFL protests may have heightened Americans’ awareness of our responsibility to respect those who serve in the military. Across the total sample, 55 percent agreed with this assessment. Further, 56 percent of respondents said that media coverage of Gold Star families has increased their awareness of what military sacrifice means.

This common ground is worth our attention, especially as we approach the clean slate of 2018. Our commitment to veterans has long strengthened our country and reinforced the values of our communities, and it can continue to bind us moving forward.

Our survey also revealed another area of agreement among Americans across all regions, age groups, city sizes and levels of education: On the question of whether the U.S. government is doing enough to serve wounded veterans, more than eight in 10 Americans were unified in their belief that it’s not.

At the Bob Woodruff Foundation, we aim to complement the government’s efforts to tackle the tough challenges that injured veterans and their families can face. This includes dedicating funds and resources to address the critical shortage of mental health-care providers serving the military and veteran population.

This need was very painfully reinforced recently when a former U.S. Air Force member murdered much of the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

According to the RAND Center for Military Health Policy Research, approximately 18.5 percent of U.S. service members who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. And 19.5 percent report experiencing a traumatic brain injury during deployment.

While it’s still unclear exactly how his time as a service member impacted the Texas gunman, we do know that Americans are looking for ways to help and to come together after yet another deeply felt and shared tragedy.

By supporting those organizations and programs that are committed to meeting the emerging and long-term needs of our veterans and their families, Americans can meet again – not on a football field, not on a battleground, but on a common ground.","Despite the NFL’s anthem protests, Americans can meet again on common ground to support our nation’s veterans",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/03/despite-nfl-s-anthem-protests-americans-can-meet-again-on-common-ground-to-support-our-nation-s-veterans.html

It is one of the Vietnam War's most famous battles. The locals called it ""Dong Ap Bia"" or ""Mountain of the Crouching Beast""; the Americans came to know it as Hamburger Hill.

But what do you really know about the fight?

Risking serious injury due to unexploded bombs and ordnance, ""War Stories Investigates"" journeyed to the top of Hamburger Hill. We traveled over 8,000 miles and, in doing so, ""War Stories"" became the first journalists or camera crew to visit Hamburger Hill since the Vietnam War. This unprecedented expedition will provide you an amazing understanding of what it is was like to do battle on this rain forest-covered mountain.

In May of 1969 the famed 101st Airborne Division launched ""Operation Apache Snow."" The goal was simple: enter the A-Shau Valley, find the enemy and kill them. But, even a good plan never survives first contact with the enemy.

From the beginning of the war, the A-Shau's steep, jungle covered slopes and valleys were an enemy stronghold. This American and South Vietnamese assault would be met with stunning force, but not where or how anyone expected.

In this fascinating episode of ""War Stories"" you will meet a Vietnamese veteran who fought with the enemy. Hear him talk about the tactics that worked against America and our weapons he most feared. You will also learn what it was like from American veterans.

""War Stories"" sat down with over a dozen men who battled for the mountain. Men like Frank Boccia, John Snyder and Ray Walker, all members of Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 187th Regiment of the famed ""Screaming Eagles.""

Officials handed out masks to those who stayed behind in Montecito, an exclusive community about 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles that’s home to stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Drew Barrymore.

Forecasters predicted dry winds that spread fires throughout the region for a week would begin to lose their power Monday. Light gusts were driving the flames away from communities, Santa Barbara County fire spokesman Mike Eliason said. But the possibility of “unpredictable” gusts would keep firefighters on edge, he said.

My commute home tonight. We are safe. Others aren’t. Pray for them. A post shared by Rob Lowe (@robloweofficial) on Dec 5, 2017 at 8:43pm PST

Actor Rob Lowe wore a mask as he live-streamed his family evacuating Sunday from their smoke-shrouded home.

“Praying for the people in my area,” he said to his Instagram followers. “Hope everybody’s getting out safe like we are, and thanks for the prayers and thoughts. And good luck to the firefighters, we need you!”

Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that neighbors were helping each other and their animals get to safety.

“I’m sending lots of love and gratitude to the fire department and sheriffs. Thank you all,” she wrote.

Tens of thousands have fled their homes as flames churn through foothill towns near Santa Barbara, the latest flare-up after a week of wind-fanned wildfires throughout the region.

With acrid smoke thick in the air, even residents not under evacuation orders took the chance to leave, fearing another shutdown of a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week.

The blaze has destroyed more than 750 buildings, officials said. It was partially contained after burning nearly 360 square miles of dry brush and timber.

Customers coming into Jeannine’s American Bakery in Montecito brushed ash from their clothes and marveled at smoke so heavy that visibility was down to just a few feet.

“There’s so much ash it’s unbelievable,” manager Richard Sanchez said. “Everything is white. The streets are covered, cars are covered, our parking lot is covered.”

Amtrak canceled service through the city of Santa Barbara, and its nearly 200-year-old mission church was closed because of smoke and ash. Authorities issued repeated alerts about unhealthy air and warned people to stay indoors, avoid vigorous outdoor activities and not do anything to stir up ash.

Dr. Helene Gardner, an expert in air quality at University of California, Santa Barbara, watched ash fall “like a fine snow” from her home after the school postponed final exams until January. She said her environmental sciences students got a kick from the fact that the delay was directly related to their field of study.

Gardner warned that the air alerts should be taken seriously because of airborne particulates — “nasty buggers” that can lodge in lungs and cause respiratory problems.

She said the levels of particulates from a wildfire can approach those seen near coal-burning plants in pollution-heavy China and are especially problematic for people exerting themselves.

“When I look out my window and see someone bicycling I think, ‘No, no, no, get off your bike and walk!’” she said.

“I’m not frightened yet,” Carpinteria resident Roberta Lehtinen told KABC-TV. “I don’t think it’s going to come roaring down unless the winds kick up.”

Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region’s most disastrous wildfires. They blow from the inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.

Firefighters gained more control over other major blazes in Southern California and diverted resources to the Santa Barbara foothills to combat the enormous fire that started Dec. 4.

Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the winds. Though the state emerged this spring from a years-long drought, hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months.

High fire risk is expected to last into January.

Akayed Ullah, the 27-year-old attempted suicide bomber, lived in Brooklyn, New York, but emigrated from the Asian country of Bangladesh nearly seven years ago, authorities said.

He “was admitted to the United States after presenting a passport displaying an F43 family immigrant visa in 2011,” Houlton said of Ullah, who “is a Lawful Permanent Resident … who benefited from extended family chain migration.”

Ullah was one of 141,501 immigrants who have entered the U.S. from Bangladesh through chain migration since 2005, according to the White House.

What is chain migration?

“Chain migration” occurs when immigrants enter the U.S. through sponsorship from family members already settled in the country. Critics have said it theoretically could trigger an endless flow of family members emigrating in.

The term made headlines in recent months after another New York City terror suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the U.S. through the Diversity Visa Program — a State Department program which allows a maximum of 50,000 people from “countries with historically low rates of immigration” to enter the U.S. each year.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders noted on Monday that President Trump's “policy has called for an end to chain migration. If that has been in place, that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States.”

“The president is aggressively going to continue to push forth immigration reform and ending chain migration will certainly be a part of that process,” Sanders added.

What is the F43 family immigrant visa?

The F43 is a classification of the documentation of immigrants and nonimmigrants by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

The “F43” classification specifically is designated for immigrants who enter the United States as the child of a sibling of a U.S. citizen who’s at least 21 years old, according to USCIS.

The Port Authority terror suspect’s mother was able to enter the U.S. through sponsorship from Ullah’s uncle, a law enforcement official told Fox News.

Ullah emigrated to the U.S. months before his 21st birthday, the official said. Had he been 21 years old, a family member would not have been allowed to petition for him to obtain a visa.

What is a lawful permanent resident?

Ullah is a lawful permanent resident (LPS) here in the U.S. Holding the status of a permanent resident means the immigrant has a “green card” to both live and work in the country permanently.

In order for permanent residents to maintain their status in the U.S., they have to apply for and complete the naturalization process to become a U.S. citizen. Lawful permanent residents can lose their status if a judge has ordered them to leave the country, or they can intentionally abandon the status on their own.

Permanent residents can petition for family members — a spouse, unmarried children under age 21 and unmarried children of any age — to obtain a green card in the U.S.

However, New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office, which oversees attempts by foreign investors to purchase property in the country, mandates that individuals involved in such transactions maintain “good character.” An OIO spokesperson told FOX Business that the agency is “aware that allegations have been made in relation to Matt Lauer” and has contacted his representative for further information on the situation.

The OIO can seek orders, through the Courts, that require people to dispose of property.”

Hunter Valley Station has a five-bedroom estate, four airstrips, stables and various other amenities, according to local media. Business Insider was first to report on the OIO’s investigation.

NBC fired Lauer, the longtime host of the “Today” show, last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Subsequent reports by Variety and the New York Times detailed allegations by several women against Lauer, who was accused of exposing to a female employee and giving another colleague a sex toy as a gift, among other alleged transgressions.

The media echo chamber spent the week speculating about whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller can or will nab President Trump on obstruction-of-justice charges. All the while it continues to ignore Washington’s most obvious obstruction—the coordinated effort to thwart congressional probes of the role law enforcement played in the 2016 election.

The news that senior FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text messages with another FBI official matters—though we’ve yet to see the content. The bigger scandal is that the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mr. Mueller have known about those texts for months and deliberately kept their existence from Congress. The House Intelligence Committee sent document subpoenas and demanded an interview with Mr. Strzok. The Justice Department dodged, and then leaked.

The department also withheld from Congress that another top official, Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, was in contact with ex-spook Christopher Steele and the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. It has refused to say what role the Steele dossier—Clinton-commissioned oppo research—played in its Trump investigation. It won’t turn over files about its wiretapping.

And Mr. Mueller—who is well aware the House is probing all this, and considered the Strzok texts relevant enough to earn the agent a demotion—nonetheless did not inform Congress about the matter. Why? Perhaps Mr. Mueller feels he’s above being bothered with any other investigation. Or perhaps his team is covering for the FBI and the Justice Department.

When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller, he stressed that he wanted a probe with “independence from the normal chain of command.” Yet the Mueller team is made up of the same commanders who were previously running the Trump show at the Justice Department and the FBI, and hardly distant from their old office.

Andrew Weissmann, Mr. Mueller’s deputy, is chief of the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section and was once FBI general counsel. Until Mr. Strzok’s demotion, he was a top FBI counterintelligence officer, lead on the Trump probe. Michael Dreeben is a deputy solicitor general. Elizabeth Prelogar, Brandon Van Grack, Kyle Freeny, Adam Jed, Andrew Goldstein —every one is a highly placed, influential lawyer on loan from the Justice Department. Lisa Page —Mr. Strzok’s mistress, with whom he exchanged those texts—was on loan from the FBI general counsel’s office.

Since the first brave woman stepped out of the shadows in October to speak about the decades-long alleged sexual misconduct of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, we have seen a growing number of prominent men accused by women (and a few men) who are breaking their silence about sexual harassment, abuse and assault.

I will never know the full pain and trauma of the Silence Breakers or others who have been victims of sexual misconduct. But I know all too well the domino effect this can create.

My wife was just 10 years old when her innocence was sabotaged by three teenage creeps from her neighborhood who decided to feed on what they considered to be easy prey – a young, trusting girl as innocent as a winter snow.

This was only the beginning.

Sexual assault is a crime that never goes away and happens over and over in the mind, heart and soul.

Within a few short years she was ambushed again, this time at the hands of not only a family member but also a sexual predator. The calculated manipulation went on for years.

Like most girls and women in this terrible situation, my wife was gripped by fear. She hid under a veil of grief, confusion, self-blame, embarrassment, shame and a warehouse of other emotions and feelings that tortured and plagued her. In spite of her inescapable pain and nightmares, she told absolutely no one – until the day she opened the floodgates to me.

I was crushed for her and wanted to help, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t relate. While I was committed to supporting her in finding healing from her past and expressing unconditional love toward her, I quickly realized that the insidiousness of sexual misconduct permeates far beyond its survivors.

I knew she was wounded, but I had no idea how deep the wounds were until months after we married.

I naively assumed she was over her tortured past and unknowingly didn’t understand why she was unable to connect with me on a physical level. But immediately after the “I Do’s” were spoken, marriage intimacy began to stir up old memories for my bride.

She still felt damaged and I felt rejected. She resented my advances. I’m ashamed to admit it, but no matter how hard I tried, I resented her rejection. All the while we both carried guilt: she because she wasn’t meeting my needs and me because I felt it was unfair for me to have them.

During this same time, our communication rapidly evaporated. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t help me understand, and I was ashamed that I was unable to do so. At other times, I wanted to share my own hurt and insecurities. I didn’t because I felt I was being selfish, since she was the one who had been violated. The cycle was not only poisonous but was destroying every aspect of our marriage.

My wife’s individual abuse reverberated collaterally to our entire family, even creating an unhealthy over-protectiveness of our daughter. I was so filled with anger over what had happened to my wife that all I cared about was personally guarding my daughter and her future marriage.

I even went so far as to threaten to kill a neighbor if anything were to happen to my little girl while staying overnight with his daughter.

For my wife and me, the inability to find a cure or common ground led us to the brink of divorce. A close friend suggested we go for marriage counseling. After only a few sessions, the counselor recommended we meet both collectively and individually.

It was a brutal time that required unending faith, forgiveness, patience and understanding. Initially, it got worse for her and us together before it got better.

We didn’t just dig up bones but entire corpses that had been suppressed and ignored because of the suffering they caused to our immediate and extended family. But by walking through the fire, we were refined and strengthened. Only then did we find healing together.

Today we have three kids and have been married for over 20 years. I can honestly say that there are still short seasons of struggle and the process of healing will always be ongoing, but we are growing in love and strength each and every year. I will never totally comprehend her suffering, but I am committed to patiently trying.

Sexual assault is a crime that never goes away and happens over and over in the mind, heart and soul.

I regret that it took me so long to gain a deeper understanding of the layers of healing and patience to which my wife and all victims need and should be entitled. A victim should never feel ashamed to step forward, no matter how much time has passed.

I celebrate the Silence Breakers and pray that recent news coverage of high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct will wake our nation up to the need to enforce severe consequences for unacceptable and intolerable sexual misconduct.

Only then can we save and protect the American family.",My wife was a victim of sexual misconduct – Here’s why the Silence Breakers are vital,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/09/my-wife-was-victim-sexual-misconduct-here-s-why-silence-breakers-are-vital.html

In Washington, the ostensible story is rarely the real story. We know, for example, that former President Clinton engineered a meeting with President Obama’s attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on the tarmac of the Phoenix Airport on June 27, 2016.

That’s the official story, replete with the charming and intentionally disarming detail that all they talked about was their grandchildren. It was just coincidental, don’t you know, that at the time the FBI was looking into Hillary Clinton’s use of a “personal” email server to send, receive and store classified information.

And it was also simply coincidental that just a few days later, the director of the FBI – who served under Attorney General Lynch – announced that he wouldn’t recommend a prosecution of Hillary Clinton.

Richard Nixon must be rolling over in his grave.

What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting. In fact, the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous meeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton – but rather on one of the whistleblowers who got the word out.

The organization I head, Judicial Watch, asked the FBI on July 7, 2016, for any records that might pertain to the infamous tarmac meeting. We had to sue after we were ignored by the agency.

Then the FBI told us flat-out that it couldn’t find any records. And we now know that was flat-out untrue.

As is usually the case with ""The Walking Dead,"" not everyone is going to make it out of this alive.

The episode opens right where last week’s left off. Rick has discovered that the Saviors have escaped the walker perimeter that he, Maggie and Ezekiel have so tediously set up. Not only are the Saviors out and looking to retaliate for the attack, but he’s got to convince the reluctant Scavengers he brought to not kill him. Fortunately the last part is done for him as they’re hit with fire from the Sanctuary, allowing the Scavengers to run away to smell up the place another day.

With Rick pinned down and alone, Carol arrives to help, but it’s unclear how she knew he was in danger. They escape and make haste to their respective homes, not knowing where Negan will hit.

Meanwhile, the episode catches up with Aaron and Enid, who went on a mysterious mission at the end of last week’s episode. It turns out, they’re heading to the Oceanside community to ask for help. This is a tall order given that the last time they were there, they took all of their guns. However, their plan quickly goes south when Aaron is caught by the leader of Oceanside in the dark, forcing Enid to shoot her. Just like that, they’re not only captured, but look an awful lot like an assassination team rather than a peace envoy.

Back in Alexandria, the unsuspecting survivors are planning to return to the Sanctuary where they’ll accept Negan and the Savior’s surrender. The picturesque survival life is cut drastically short when Negan bangs on the gate and shouts at them through a loudspeaker. He makes it clear that the way he sees the night going is for the Alexandrians to accept their loss, line up in front of their homes to apologize and watch him kill Rick in front of everyone. Also, he plans to kill the person with the lamest apology.

Alexandria isn’t alone. The Kingdom is easily invaded now that their able-bodied soldiers are all dead. When King Ezekiel hears them coming, he manages to go into hiding as his people are told they’ll no longer be allowed to just give the Saviors a fraction of their earnings. They’ll only get just enough to stay alive, and those well-enough to travel will have to help rebuild the Sanctuary.

Meanwhile, Maggie and Jesus are leading the Hilltop’s people to go collect Negan’s surrender, only to be halted on the road by the Saviors, who reveal they’ve captured everyone’s favorite axe-wielding nobleman, Jerry. He doesn’t look good. Simon emerges to inform them that they’ll kill Jerry unless they surrender. Backed into a corner, Maggie and Jesus comply as Simon makes it clear that their status as farmers is the only thing keeping the Hilltop alive. The alternative was to kill Jerry now, Maggie in front of everyone at the Hilltop and then lead the walker herd to its walls to starve them out.

Their compliance, while able to avoid Simon’s plan A, doesn’t save Neil, a Hilltop member that Simon executes to teach them a lesson. Maggie asks for the coffin that was meant to intimidate them as a way to bury Neil, and their altercation is over. She returns to the Hilltop and executes a prisoner. She leaves the box with a message for Negan, revealing she'll kill the hostages if he tries anything.

Back at Alexandria, Carl is calling the shots and hatches a plan for him to distract Negan at the front gate while the Alexandrians burst out the back. He approaches Negan and offers his own life as punishment for what his father did to the Saviors. Negan is surprised by the offer, everyone seems to be. He’s always had a soft spot for Carl, so he asks him if he actually wants to die. However, when he notices the Alexandrians escaping, he flips.

“Was that just a play? I thought we were having a moment you little a------,” he yells. “BOMBS AWAY!”

With that, the Saviors start bombing Alexandria from outside the gates.

Carl gets knocked prone for a minute and isn’t able to make his otherwise daring escape before the Saviors get in. Negan gets inside and orders his men to find Carl but not kill him, to blow up the rest of the houses and send Rick to him once he returns.

Meanwhile, the second part of Carl’s plan goes into effect. Dwight, their man on the inside of the Saviors, didn’t fortify the back exit as well as he could have. He also leads the pursuing Saviors into a trap where Daryl, Tara, Rosita and more ambush them. Realizing he can’t return fire against the Alexandrians, he makes himself known as the traitor and guns down his own people. However, one of them escapes, free to tell the tale of Dwight’s betrayal. On the plus side, Daryl finally got his vest back.

Back at the Kingdom, the Saviors are searching for Ezekiel because they want him alive. The King uses this opportunity to create a distraction that allows the others to escape. However, it meant submitting himself for capture. If he tries to escape again, he’ll lose his arms. Just like that, the Kingdom has fallen.

The episode ends on some high drama, as Rick stealthily returns to Alexandria to search for Carl, Judith and Michonne. Instead, he finds Negan, and the two of them finally have a one-on-one showdown. Negan’s Lucille gives him a small advantage, but Rick manages to knock him down. However, when Rick picks up Lucille to do some damage, it enrages Negan who pushes him out a window. Cutting his losses, Rick escapes into the night to find Michonne and make his way underground where the rest of the Alexandrians are hiding in the sewers. He assesses the situation finally finding his son.

Carl looks pale and admits that the reason he was so willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good was because his attempts to save a stranger last week led to him getting bitten by a walker. The bite is on his side, so there’s no going back. Unfortunately, fans will have to wait until the show returns in February to find out what happens, if the Alexandrians can rebuild and how the war with Negan will end.","'The Walking Dead' Season 8, Episode 8 recap: The midseason finale shakes up the whole series",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/10/walking-dead-season-8-episode-8-recap-midseason-finale-shakes-up-whole-series.html

No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us.
Keeping the individual AMT means many Americans will see no tax cut under the GOP bill, Burr says.
“I am confident the House and Senate conferees will fix the individual AMT in the final tax reform bill,” he says.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared in the Washington Post.

The phones of House and Senate leaders are ringing off the hook right now, as CEOs and wealthy donors lobby them furiously to lower the top income tax rate and insert costly carve-outs into the GOP tax bill to protect their business tax preferences. Too bad regular taxpayers don’t have a direct line to the conferees hammering out the final bill to plead their cases. Because it seems as though they have been forgotten.

Case in point: At the last minute, Senate Republicans changed their version of the tax bill to keep the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) — a pernicious parallel tax code which they had promised to scrap that requires corporations and millions of individuals to calculate their taxes twice and pay whichever rate is higher. On hearing the news, corporate lobbyists swung into action, pressing GOP leaders to get rid of the corporate AMT in the final bill. And their efforts seem to be paying off. The corporate AMT “has to be eliminated,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on Monday.

But what about individuals? Who is championing AMT repeal for them?

Enter Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is fighting to get the individual AMT removed from the final tax reform bill as well. “Repeal of the individual AMT has been a fundamental element of Republican tax reform campaign promises for years,” he told me. “By leaving the individual AMT in place, we would be punishing hardworking Americans and doing virtually nothing to simplify the tax code.”

Burr is right. Congress created the AMT in 1969 after the Treasury Department reported that 155 high-income filers were using tax breaks to avoid paying any income taxes. In 1970, it affected only 20,000 very high-income taxpayers. But today, the number of people impacted has ballooned to 5.2 million. Most of those who currently pay the AMT are not from the highest-income households for which the tax was intended, but the middle and upper-middle class — folks who have enough money to be a ripe target of revenue raisers, but not enough to have influence on Capitol Hill. They are mostly two-earner households with mortgages to pay, who give to charity and have children. The AMT also hits the families of our fallen warriors. According to Burr, children who receive an annuity from the Uniformed Services Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) can see the AMT eat up as much as 26 percent of their benefit. No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us.

Members of the Trump administration know that the AMT is a horrible tax. In 2006, Kevin Hassett — now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers — called the AMT “an economic abomination”and urged Congress to “erase it from the tax code completely.” Yet instead of erasing it, Republicans are retaining it.

Keeping the individual AMT means many Americans will see no tax cut under the GOP bill, Burr says. It defeats the entire purpose of tax reform. GOP leaders promised to make the tax code simpler and fairer. But the AMT increases tax complexity and raises compliance costs for 10 million American taxpayers, who must calculate their taxes using two separate systems every year — and then pay whichever rate is the highest. That is not simple or fair. It is obscene.

GOP leaders are focused on passing corporate tax cuts to fuel economic growth, which is a good thing. But they seem to have lost sight of the fact that reducing taxes for individuals is important, too. According to the Tax Policy Center, even before the AMT retention, 1 in 4 Americans will not get any tax cut under the Senate bill, and 14 percent of middle-class Americans will get a tax increase of $1,170. That is a problem for the GOP. If Americans see the GOP borrowing $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts, and they end up getting either no tax cut or paying more next year, they will punish Republicans at the polls. Instead of more carve-outs for corporations and fat-cat donors, Republicans should give tax relief to more individuals, especially the middle class.

Will Burr vote no on final passage if the individual AMT is not repealed? He hopes it won’t come to that. “I am confident the House and Senate conferees will fix the individual AMT in the final tax reform bill,” he says. Let’s hope he’s right. If Republicans get rid of the AMT for corporations, but not for individuals, that will send a clear message to American voters about where the GOP’s interests lie.",Marc Thiessen: Republicans know the AMT is an 'abomination.'

The suspect in Monday morning's blast at Port Authority in midtown Manhattan was identified as Akayed Ullah, 27. Ullah strapped a pipe bomb to his body with Velcro and zip ties, and it detonated in a subway corridor, police said.

Details on a possible motive were unclear, though analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group noted that the pro-ISIS Maqdisi media group suggested a link between the attack and President Trump's decision last week to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, The Washington Post reported.

What do we know about the suspect?

Ullah lived in Brooklyn after he entered the U.S. in 2011 from Bangladesh on a chain migration visa, Department of Homeland Security Press Secretary Tyler Houlton said in a statement.

The DHS said Ullah came to the U.S. on an F43 visa, a preferential visa available for those with family in the U.S. who are citizens.

He was considered a ""Lawful Permanent Resident from Bangladesh,"" Houlton told Fox News.

Law enforcement officials said Ullah was inspired by ISIS but didn't appear to have direct contact with the group and likely acted alone.

Ullah was a licensed cab driver from March 2012 to March 2015, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission confirmed to Fox News. His TLC For-Hire Vehicle Driver's License was not renewed after 2015.

The TLC spokesperson did not confirm ""whether he drove for any particular base, or whether he simply got the license but didn't drive at all."" He did say Ullah was not licensed to drive a yellow taxi.

An Uber spokeswoman confirmed to Fox News that the ride-sharing company has no record of Ullah being ""connected to the Uber platform."" Lyft also does not ""have any records"" that Ullah worked for it, a spokesperson told Fox News.

What else do we know about the attack?

The suspect allegedly packed a 5-inch metal pipe bomb and battery pack into the right side of his jacket, according to The New York Post. Ullah told police he made the bomb at his work, law enforcement sources told Fox News.

The Post reported that he worked for an electrical company.

The device was an “effectively low-tech device,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Officials said they are investigating whether the suspect detonated the bomb intentionally or if it went off prematurely.

The explosion occurred just before 7:30 a.m. near 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues, law enforcement officials said. The explosion triggered a massive emergency response by police and fire both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at Port Authority.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the explosion was an “attempted terrorist attack.”

“At this point in time,” the only suspect is the one man already in custody, de Blasio said Monday morning, adding that the city is lucky the suspect didn’t achieve his intended goals.

At least four people, not including the suspect, were injured in the explosion, an NYPD spokeswoman confirmed to Fox News Monday afternoon. Three patients have been released from the hospital.

Shopping for a sleeper sofa is more than just about picking a look you like. That’s because there are several types of mattresses and configurations and each one can affect sleeping comfort, sitting surface and space planning.

Futons. The most basic of sleeper sofas, a futon has a metal or wood frame with a single mattress on top. When it’s folded up, the mattress creates both the back and seat of the sofa. While pretty comfortable as a bed, a futon can leave something to be desired as a sofa, since it has a firm and somewhat unforgiving seat.

Daybeds. A daybed is a single twin mattress that sits in a frame to give it the look of a sofa. Since the frame lacks the cushioning of a standard sofa, this style is best for a room that’s not going to be used regularly for entertaining.

Standard foldouts. This style is probably what comes to mind when you think of a sleeper sofa. The mattress is supported by a thick, canvas-like fabric that’s secured by springs on the side. Foldout mattresses come in a few different options: all innerspring, all foam or innerspring with an air topper — which seems to be the winner for comfort. These sleepers require more space since you need room to unfold the mattress.

The foldout sleeper comes in a wide variety of styles. Comfort and quality vary widely depending on the manufacturer, so if this is going to be a daily-use sofa, purchase the best you can afford. The sofas lack the supportive springs found in a non-sleeper sofa, so they do feel a little different when you sit on them. As for sleeping, the thin mattress means you may feel the support bars when you lie down.

Pullout pop-ups. This style operates like a trundle: A bottom mattress pulls out from under the sofa. You can use it as two twin beds or pop the lower mattress up to create a larger bed. You don’t need as much space to pull out the bed since it has you sleeping parallel to the back of the sofa.

Since it’s an actual mattress, the pullout pop-up style provides a comfortable sleeping surface. It’s also comfortable as a sofa, as long as you like a more firm seating surface — you’re sitting on one of the innerspring mattresses. It can also be used in multiple configurations, such as a family-size chaise.

Other things to consider. While comfort and style are important when choosing a sleeper sofa, there are other things you should consider as well: how it will be used, how often it will be used for sleeping and what size room it will be in.

How will it be used? Is this going to be a main sofa in a living room or something used a lot less frequently in an office or guest room? If it’s going in the living room, you’ll want seating comfort to be a priority. Choosing a cushion with an innerspring core can help make up for the loss of the spring suspension.

How much sleeping will it get? If the sofa won’t be used for weeks at a time as a bed, then a standard foldout sleeper should be fine. For more regularly used sleepers, consider a pullout pop-up or an air-topped foldout mattress.

How big is the room? You don’t want to have to move lots of furniture around whenever you want to transform the sofa into a bed. Foldout sleepers take up the most space when converted to a bed. If you have a tight fit, go with a pullout pop-up.

“At that moment, if he had stopped me and told me that I was beautiful enough, I would have stopped, but he didn’t,” she said.

Even after all of her operations, he still didn’t like her breasts. So she got them augmented last year.

On December 7, 1941 -- ""the date that will live in infamy"" -- Pearl Harbor wasn't the only American military installation attacked by the Japanese. Just hours after the bombings in Hawaii, the enemy also set their sights on the 1,600 Americans located on three tiny specks of coral 2000 miles west of Honolulu, known as Wake Island.

In the 1930s, Wake was an important stopover on the long flights between Hawaii and the Far East. Pan American Airlines built a luxurious hotel there for passengers flying its new Clipper aircraft. But an empire-building Japan was determined to take the strategic island at all cost. Clearly overconfident, the enemy expected only feeble resistance from 350 Marines of the 1st Defense Battalion and the 1,200 civilian contractors stationed on the island. They were dead wrong.

For over two weeks, the Marines and contractors, under the command of Major James Devereux, out-maneuvered and outfought the enemy. You'll hear from Jack Skaggs and Ewing Laporte as they recount battles which handed the Japanese their first tactical defeat in World War II. But victory was fleeting. The Japanese Navy under the command of Admiral Kajioka returned with an armada of over 40 ships and the small American garrison, battling incredible odds, was forced to surrender the island. In the aftermath, the Wake Island defenders suffered as POWs in the brutal hands of their captors.

What is the F43 family immigrant visa?","The Bangladeshi man who allegedly detonated a pipe bomb near New York City’s Port Authority Bus Terminal on Monday came to the U.S. through chain migration, Department of Homeland Security Press Secretary Tyler Houlton confirmed to Fox News.

Akayed Ullah, the 27-year-old attempted suicide bomber, lived in Brooklyn, New York, but emigrated from the Asian country of Bangladesh nearly seven years ago, authorities said.

He “was admitted to the United States after presenting a passport displaying an F43 family immigrant visa in 2011,” Houlton said of Ullah, who “is a Lawful Permanent Resident … who benefited from extended family chain migration.”

Ullah was one of 141,501 immigrants who have entered the U.S. from Bangladesh through chain migration since 2005, according to the White House.

What is chain migration?

“Chain migration” occurs when immigrants enter the U.S. through sponsorship from family members already settled in the country. Critics have said it theoretically could trigger an endless flow of family members emigrating in.

The term made headlines in recent months after another New York City terror suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the U.S. through the Diversity Visa Program — a State Department program which allows a maximum of 50,000 people from “countries with historically low rates of immigration” to enter the U.S. each year.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders noted on Monday that President Trump's “policy has called for an end to chain migration. If that has been in place, that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States.”

“The president is aggressively going to continue to push forth immigration reform and ending chain migration will certainly be a part of that process,” Sanders added.

What is the F43 family immigrant visa?

The F43 is a classification of the documentation of immigrants and nonimmigrants by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

The “F43” classification specifically is designated for immigrants who enter the United States as the child of a sibling of a U.S. citizen who’s at least 21 years old, according to USCIS.

The Port Authority terror suspect’s mother was able to enter the U.S. through sponsorship from Ullah’s uncle, a law enforcement official told Fox News.

Ullah emigrated to the U.S. months before his 21st birthday, the official said. Had he been 21 years old, a family member would not have been allowed to petition for him to obtain a visa.

What is a lawful permanent resident?

Ullah is a lawful permanent resident (LPS) here in the U.S. Holding the status of a permanent resident means the immigrant has a “green card” to both live and work in the country permanently.

In order for permanent residents to maintain their status in the U.S., they have to apply for and complete the naturalization process to become a U.S. citizen. Lawful permanent residents can lose their status if a judge has ordered them to leave the country, or they can intentionally abandon the status on their own.

Permanent residents can petition for family members — a spouse, unmarried children under age 21 and unmarried children of any age — to obtain a green card in the U.S.

By David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, The Wall Street Journal



Speculation about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has turned toward obstruction of justice—specifically, whether President Trump can be criminally prosecuted for firing James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or for earlier asking Mr. Comey to go easy on onetime national security adviser Mike Flynn. The answer is no. The Constitution forbids Congress to criminalize such conduct by a president, and applying existing statutes in such a manner would violate the separation of powers.

The Constitution creates three coequal branches of government, and no branch may exercise its authority in a manner that would negate or fundamentally undercut the power of another. The power to appoint and remove high-level executive-branch officers, such as the FBI director, is a core aspect of the president’s executive authority. It is the principal means by which a president disciplines the exercise of the executive power the Constitution vests in him.

The same is true of Mr. Trump’s request, as purported by Mr. Comey: “I hope you can see your way clear . . . to letting Flynn go.” The FBI director wields core presidential powers when conducting an investigation, and the president is entirely within his rights to inquire about, and to direct, such investigations. The director is free to ignore the president’s inquiries or directions and risk dismissal, or to resign if he believes the president is wrong. Such officials serve at the president’s pleasure and have no right to be free of such dilemmas.",Can a President Obstruct Justice?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/11/can-president-obstruct-justice#commenting

The claims come from the recently filed class-action lawsuit against Weinstein by six women alleging that not only is the 65-year-old guilty of sexual assault, but that extreme measures were taken by companies around him to cover up any wrongdoing. In that suit, it is alleged that “Bridget Jones” actress Renee Zellweger performed “sexual favors” for Weinstein in order to move her career forward.

“If Harvey said that, he’s full of s---,” a rep for Zellweger told Fox News.

Zellweger starred in a handful of projects produced by Weinstein’s companies, most notably “Cold Mountain,” for which she won an Oscar in 2004.

Weinstein has been at the forefront of the public’s conversation since October, when a litany of women came forward with allegations of harassment, assault and other misconduct.

According to the lawsuit, actresses and other women in the film industry were lured by Weinstein’s promises of fame and work into hotel rooms, offices and more private meetings where he allegedly routinely harassed them.

A rep for Weinstein told Fox News that “Mr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them,"" following accusations that he also slept with Gwyneth Paltrow and Charlize Theron.

""It’s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, academy award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It’s simply not true,"" the statement read.

Editor's note: this originally appeared in The Hill.

The charge to which retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty may tell us a great deal about the Robert Mueller investigation.

The first question is, why did Flynn lie? People who lie to the FBI generally do so because, if they told the truth, they would be admitting to a crime. But the two conversations that Flynn falsely denied having were not criminal. He may have believed they were criminal but, if he did, he was wrong.

Consider his request to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., to delay or oppose a United Nations Security Council vote on an anti-Israel resolution that the outgoing Obama administration refused to veto. Not only was that request not criminal, it was the right thing to do. President Obama's unilateral decision to change decades-long American policy by not vetoing a perniciously one-sided anti-Israel resolution was opposed by Congress and by most Americans. It was not good for America, for Israel or for peace. It was done out of Obama's personal pique against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rather than on principle.

Despite the banner headlines calling the Flynn guilty plea a ""thunderclap,"" I think it may be a show of weakness on the part of the special counsel rather than a sign of strength.

Many Americans of both parties, including me, urged the lame-duck Obama not to tie the hands of the president-elect by allowing the passage of a resolution that would make it more difficult to achieve a negotiated peace in the Middle East.

As the president-elect, Donald Trump was constitutionally and politically entitled to try to protect his ability to broker a fair peace between the Israelis and Palestinians by urging all members of the Security Council to vote against or delay the enactment of the resolution. The fact that such efforts to do the right thing did not succeed does not diminish the correctness of the effort. I wish it had succeeded. We would be in a better place today.

Some left-wing pundits, who know better, are trotting out the Logan Act, which, if it were the law, would prohibit private citizens (including presidents-elect) from negotiating with foreign governments. But this anachronistic law hasn't been used for more than 200 years. Under the principle of desuetude - a legal doctrine that prohibits the selective resurrection of a statute that has not been used for many decades - it is dead-letter. Moreover, the Logan Act is unconstitutional insofar as it prohibits the exercise of free speech.",Dershowitz: Why Did Flynn Lie and Why Did Mueller Charge Him with Lying?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/05/dershowitz-why-did-flynn-lie-and-why-did-mueller-charge-him-lying#commenting

“Food Network takes matters like this very seriously and we are putting relaunch plans for 'Molto Mario' on hold.”A representative for Mario Batali or his restaurant group was not immediately available to comment.","Mario Batali has been asked to temporarily leave his ABC series ""The Chew"" — and his upcoming Food Network series is said to be ""on hold"" — in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct, Fox News has learned.

The celebrity chef, 57, said he will “step away from the day-to-day operations” of his restaurant empire after four women accused him of inappropriate behavior in the workplace and elsewhere, including grabbing and groping three of his female employees, and even grabbing a fellow chef who approached him at a New Orleans wine auction ten years ago, Eater NY reported on Monday morning.

The four women have declined to reveal their names, but the latter accuser claimed that Batali groped her breasts after she spilled wine on her chest, while saying something to the effect of “Let me help you with that.” The woman also alleges that Batali had been under the influence of alcohol at the time, and that just prior to the incident, he came off as “creepy” and “icky,” Eater reports.

MARIO BATALI'S $250 MILLION RESTAURANT EMPIRE IN LIMBO AMID SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS

The other three accusers were all employed by Batali at one time or another, and shared similar stories of Batali’s behavior with Eater. One woman says he approached her from behind and held her against himself; another says she was groped and made to “straddle” Batali; and the last, who had already stopped working for the chef, says he also grabbed her breasts.

Batali, who is married to wife Susi Cahn, has since released a statement apologizing for his actions, in which he takes “full responsibility” for the inappropriate behavior.

“I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt,” said Batali in a statement obtained by Eater. “Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.

“I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there.

""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust. I will spend the next period of time trying to do that.”

BATALI: $15 MINIMUM WAGE IS NO GOOD FOR RESTAURANTS OR CUSTOMERS

ABC confirmed to Fox News that they have asked Batali to step down as a co-host of its daytime series “The Chew.”

“We have asked Mario Batali to step away from 'The Chew' while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” writes an ABC spokesperson in a statement. “ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”

Prior to these allegations surfacing on Monday morning, celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain suggested that he knew such an exposé was coming, though he refrained from revealing Batali’s name until after the site published the accusations on Monday morning.

The accusations against Batali follow several other allegations against celebrity chefs in recent months. In November, four former employees of Johnny Iuzzini, a judge on ABC’s “Great American Baking Show,” accused the pastry chef of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior, including one woman who claims Iuzzini tried to stick his tongue in her ear “three or four times.” And in October, New Orleans chef John Besh stepped down from his restaurant group after more than two dozen of his employees came forward with accusations of harassment and sexual misconduct.

Batali and his restaurant group operate dozens of restaurants in the United States and Singapore. Along with Lidia Bastianich and Joe Bastianich, Batali co-owns the Eataly chain of Italian marketplaces.

We need a new tax plan to support American innovation, because our history and success as a nation derive from our primacy in this area. Our relatively young nation has excelled because of our scrappy, can-do entrepreneurial culture and diverse immigrant roots. We’re all attracted by – and based in – bedrock of strong constitutional freedoms. This alone makes us unique.

Taxes have become the weakest link in our nation’s innovation strategy. In January, at the world’s largest innovation event, CES, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) will release our first-ever International Innovation Scorecard, gauging the innovation-friendliness of 38 countries plus the EU.

The scorecard judges each nation on a total of 27 indicators across 12 categories. It lays out a strategy that says innovation is tied to having an environment that embraces disruptive technologies, promotes civil and economic liberties and fosters a diverse and talented population. Spoiler alert – the U.S. does well, but not by every measure. Our country’s worst score is in the tax category.

Technology drives the U.S. economy, supporting 15.3 million U.S. jobs and accounting for ten percent of gross domestic product in 2015 alone. Imagine a tax system that can further unleash America’s strongest industries to compete more vigorously.

Simply put, our tax laws today – along with our immigration policies – incentivize American companies to shift jobs abroad. Our rates are so high that there is a perverse incentive for American companies to be acquired by foreign companies who enjoy a lower tax rate. By lowering corporate taxes and shifting to a territorial system of taxation the rest of the world uses, U.S. companies will have a level playing field and be able to invest in and hire more American workers.

Lowering corporate tax rates give companies more money to invest. And much of that investment will be in people, machinery, software and services, making our companies better and economy stronger.

Last year, for the first time in 30 years, more U.S. manufacturing jobs were created or returned from overseas than left our country. Technology drives the U.S. economy, supporting 15.3 million U.S. jobs and accounting for ten percent of gross domestic product in 2015 alone. Imagine a tax system that can further unleash America’s strongest industries to compete more vigorously.

While every interest group in Washington lobbied Congress to make these good bills perfect and will now be in conference committee negotiations, I suggest a different tack. Let’s make them better by ensuring they add less to our crushing national debt.

As a matter of long-standing policy, CTA does not lobby or ask the federal government for money specifically for our industry. We have not sought, nor are we receiving in the tax bill special deals for innovators and the technology industry. But our corporate leaders believe the growing federal debt is an existential problem threatening our nation and our children’s future.

Thus, to make the tax plan better, we should reduce the cost and debt burden by showing some flexibility on the corporate tax rate. Twenty percent is ideal, but its cost is high.

We can’t make the great the enemy of the good. But we also can’t make our desire for tax reform and lower rates a burden on our children that will shift all federal spending to entitlements and interest on the federal debt. We need funds to support our national defense and we need discretionary spending in the future.

As president of Fortune and chief content officer of Time Inc. Alan Murray continues to report, many CEOs are concerned that the tax bill rushing through Congress is good in the short term but the increase in the debt it engenders will hurt us in the long term.

Piloting a heavy object with rapidly spinning propellers needs to be done with due care and attention to reduce the chances of an accident or incident taking place, whether it involves an innocent member of the public, the pilot themselves, or even the U.S. president.

With the remotely controlled copters set to be a big hit with consumers this holiday season, there’s going to be thousands of new drone taking to the skies before the end of the year. In response, New Jersey lawmakers are moving ahead with a state law that would make it a criminal offense to fly a drone under the influence of drink or drugs, NorthJersey.com reported.

The bipartisan bill, which has cleared two legislative committees though still requires a final vote, could be signed into law by the end of January 2018 and comes as 38 other U.S. states consider a similar ban.

The law will mean that flying a drone drunk could land the pilot with a six-month prison sentence, a $1,000 fine, or both, depending on the specifics of the incident.

One of the bill’s sponsors, Democratic Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, said in a statement that drones are becoming “increasingly disruptive, causing near-misses with airplanes, interfering with firefighter operations, and being used to smuggle drugs and other contraband into prisons.”

Quijano added, “This bill sets specific guidelines for how New Jersey’s residents are able to utilize these devices to establish some order and help prevent these dangerous situations.”

Interfering with firefighters or the security of prisons, considered a more serious offense than drunk droning, could result in an 18-month jail sentence or a $10,000 fine.

We don’t hear too many stories of inebriated drone pilots taking their bird for a spin, though you might recall a high-profile incident at the White House in 2015. According to reports, an off-duty and rather drunk government intelligence agency worker decided that 3 a.m. would be a good time to fly a Phantom 4 quadcopter from the balcony of a friend’s apartment. But unable to control the machine, it crashed right on the lawn of the White House, causing a security scare in the process.

But while its recent public testing has been focused on Fusion Hybrid sedans retrofitted with the equipment required for autonomous capability, it hasn’t yet revealed exactly what form the production vehicle will look like.

Since it will be used for both ride-hailing and delivery services, it will most likely be some sort of crossover utility vehicle or van that can handle both tasks.

But could a pickup pick you up?

An F-150 pickup with an array of sensors attached to it parked outside the company’s development center in Dearborn, Mich., may be evidence that Ford is looking to answer that question. In particular, it has a Velodyne lidar unit prominently mounted to the driver’s side rear corner of its bed. Lidar is one of the key pieces of technology used by most automakers to enable a vehicle to drive itself.

There are additional gadgets on the roof of the truck, plus odd-looking extended rearview mirror housings that could be hiding even more sensors, and further suggest that the technology is being tested for a specific pickup use case scenario, rather than the truck simply being used as a platform to field test the sensors.

The photographer that captured the image of the F-150 did not witness it being operated.

Ford has not yet commented on this specific vehicle, but when recently asked about the future of autonomous trucks prior to it being spotted, a company spokesman told Fox News that “trucks have to be capable of operating in a wider variety of situations and use cases than cars, such as towing, hauling and off-road. This will require greater development effort than the autonomous vehicle for commercial operation in mobility services that we’ve promised in 2021.

Lizza emerged as a household name last summer after he recorded a phone call with then-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who went off on a profanity-laced tirade. President Trump fired Scaramucci after less than two weeks.

“The New Yorker recently learned that Ryan Lizza engaged in what we believe was improper sexual conduct. We have reviewed the matter and, as a result, have severed ties with Lizza. Due to a request for privacy, we are not commenting further,” the magazine said in a statement.

Lizza is also a contributor to CNN and the network put out its own statement shortly after the news broke.

“We have just learned of the New Yorker's decision. Ryan Lizza will not appear on CNN while we look into this matter,” a CNN spokesperson said.

“I am dismayed that The New Yorker has decided to characterize a respectful relationship with a woman I dated as somehow inappropriate,” Lizza said in a statement to the media. “I am sorry to my friends, workplace colleagues, and loved ones for any embarrassment this episode may cause. I love The New Yorker... But this decision, which was made hastily and without a full investigation of the relevant facts, was a terrible mistake.”

“In no way did Mr. Lizza's misconduct constitute a 'respectful relationship' as he has now tried to characterize it,” the unnamed accuser's attorney, Douglas Wigdor, told a Washington Post reporter.

Lizza has not appeared on CNN since November 22, according to the Daily Beast. Perhaps his absence from the network is a result of appearing in the “Sh-tty Media Men” list, which has floated around the industry for several weeks. The list is filled with powerful men in the media industry who are accused anonymously of misconduct, including sexual harassment and assault.

CNN did not respond to a request for comment about whether the network would investigate Lizza or rely on The New Yorker. CNN also did not respond when asked if Lizza’s recent absence is a result of being included on the “Sh-tty Media Men” list.

The media industry has seen a significant number of high-profile men lose their jobs after being accused of sexual misconduct in recent months, including Bill O’Reilly, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin and Garrison Keillor.

Scaramucci’s political career essentially ended after he didn’t seem to realize his profane conversation with Lizza was on the record. The Hill media columnist Joe Concha pondered whether Scaramucci knew about Lizza’s alleged misconduct, pointing to comments made in a Dec. 4 interview.

""This guy’s obviously a very bad actor. Karma’s a b-tch. It’ll come back & bite him,” Scaramucci said of Lizza, according to Concha.","New Yorker fires star reporter Ryan Lizza over sexual misconduct, CNN pulls him off air",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/11/new-yorker-fires-star-reporter-ryan-lizza-over-sexual-misconduct-cnn-pulls-him-off-air.html

The mere concept of a family tradition prompts a warm and fuzzy feeling, which makes it a perfect plan to execute during the winter holidays. Here are 12 traditions that hone in on togetherness and the magic of the season.

1. Dedicate a corner to crafts. Sugar cookies, wooden ornaments and plain gift wrapping are blank canvases for littles. Convert dining room tables into a craft station once a week or leave kid-friendly supplies, like coloring books, out to keep creative wheels rolling while school’s out.



2. Shop for gifts. Asking each of your little elves to weigh in on their parent’s or sibling’s gifts can be surprisingly helpful, always heartwarming and most likely humorous. Get kids involved in the gift-giving process early to enhance their sense of generosity at a young age.



3. Decorate the Christmas tree. This one seems like a given, but the busiest time of the year can take a toll on this tradition. Although it may be easier for a parent to take charge of dragging the tree out of the attic and setting it up, decorating it all together is time well spent.



4. Tend to the gratitude tree. That gratitude tree you started for Thanksgiving can keep growing through the new year. Cut leaves from felt or colored paper, write a blessing or something that you’re grateful for on each leaf and then hang it from a vase of branches. You could also hang these as ornaments for the Christmas tree.



5. Pass around a guest book. Shower your home with even more gratitude by passing around a guest book during family gatherings. Although it sounds formal, a guest book doesn’t have to be fussy or fancy. Simply dedicate an empty journal for guests to log their favorite memory of the party. Convert a guest book into a scrapbook by pasting photos in later.



6. Mark movie night on your calendar. Although National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation seems to get funnier every year, you don’t have to endure the same movie for family movie night to turn into a tradition. Cozying up on the couch to whatever is playing on TV or taking a trip to the theater on the same day every year is an easy tradition worth trying.



7. Give game night a chance. A good game is a golden ticket to a winter-break win. Whether it’s a classic board game, Christmas trivia or your family’s own spin on the dreidel game, you really can’t go wrong.



8. Host a holiday party for kids and parents. Getting to know your children’s friends and fostering a relationship with their parents can be helpful down the road (like carpooling for Girl Scout meetings). Coordinate an annual “Friendsgiving” potluck for everyone to mingle over some cocoa and cookies. Party ideas include a gingerbread house contest, a Secret Santa gift exchange and a holiday-themed craft.



9. Try a cherished family recipe. Cooking can certainly feel like a chore this time of year, but baking something for yourself is a treat. Gather ‘round the cookbook and pick a secret family recipe that sounds particularly pleasing that you don’t typically have time or reason to make.



10. Drive around the block. Combat cabin fever by getting out of the house and into the car. Tune into the songs of the season and take the scenic route through your very own neighborhood. Take a poll on the brightest light display or the biggest yard inflatable.



11. Snap a photo. A picture with Santa is a classic snapshot, but only for a few years as kids get older. Instead of - or in addition to - Santa’s lap, pick a spot around the house for a yearly family portrait. Dress up the sofa on Christmas morning with matching pajamas or snuggle together in front of the hearth.



12. Make a donation. The new year usually sparks a whole-house decluttering effort, especially as you try to make space for new clothes and toys. Ask each family member to give every toy chest and armoire a critical look and to form two piles of items they’ve outgrown: one to donate and one to ditch. Replacing one old item for every new one is a minimal effort with a big impact that you and your local resale store will appreciate.",12 days of family traditions for an extra special season,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/12/09/12-days-family-traditions-for-extra-special-season.html

At a Thursday press conference, Sen. Al Franken is expected to announce he’s stepping down in the wake of an ever-growing list of credible sexual-harassment allegations.

His exit became inevitable Wednesday after New York’s own Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, followed by six other female Senate Democrats, called on him to resign — and the total quickly grew to dozens of senators of his own party, as well as Democratic National Committee chief Tom Perez.

“In the end, your actions made it ever-clear that you don’t deserve to share this earth with good men and women.
“You most certainly deserve the wrath of the Lord, but you also deserve His mercy.
Am I, at my core, forgiving to those who have wronged me – or am I harboring bitterness, anger and resentment?
Forgiveness is many times easier said than done, especially when one’s offending acts are damaging, life-changing or violent.","Amid the pain, suffering and horror that our nation has witnessed after a string of deadly shootings and terrorist attacks, something transformative has also been observed among the ashes: pure and unadulterated forgiveness.

It’s a collective display that holds the power and sway to both transfix and inspire us, while simultaneously refining our hearts, minds and souls.

We’ve seen it time and time again – the intense and almost unimaginable acts of forgiveness in the wake of deadly tragedy. It typically comes at the hands of people who are willing to push past their hurt and pain to muster up forgiveness for individuals who have inflicted the deepest and most gaping of emotional and physical wounds.

Just consider the remarkable events that unfolded after the Charleston shooting, when victims’ families openly forgave gunman Dylann Roof after he massacred their loved ones inside of a church in June 2015. The courageous act to offer him a gift he hadn’t asked for spoke volumes.

Then, just last month, Joe Holcombe, a great grandfather who lost nine family members during the horrific mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, shared yet another inspiring act of forgiveness when he told me just one day after the shooting that he holds no resentment for gunman Devin Kelley.

“I don’t hold any resentment to him. I wish he hadn’t of done it, but all I can say is that he is going to be rewarded for what he did – and he’s not going to like that reward,” Holcombe told me in an interview. “I don’t hate him by any means; I just feel sorry for him.”

Forgiveness is a topic I have personally grappled with this past year, as I co-authored a book about Mason Wells, a young man who survived multiple terrorist attacks and, despite facing potentially life-altering injuries, chose to forgive the terrorists responsible.

Titled, “Left Standing: The Miraculous Story of How Mason Wells's Faith Survived the Boston, Paris, and Brussels Terror Attacks,” the book tells Mason Wells’ story of surviving the Boston bombing and the Brussels airport bombing.

One of the most striking elements of Mason’s incredible story of miraculous survival is his decision to openly forgive the suicide bombers who nearly took his life in that airport. In fact, he wrote the terrorists a powerful letter that we included in “Left Standing.” Here it is:

“You must know that what you did was morally abhorrent, and it’s evident from your actions that you were deceived by evil, having given in to the twisted hatred that plagues the souls of men. You both ruined and ended lives – meaningful lives.

During a season that celebrates the very man who came to deliver forgiveness to a world that certainly doesn’t deserve it, perhaps we should all stop, think and ponder how we’re handling disappointments and conflict.

“In the end, your actions made it ever-clear that you don’t deserve to share this earth with good men and women. If I’m being honest, I’m glad both of you have moved toward God’s judgment. “You most certainly deserve the wrath of the Lord, but you also deserve His mercy. I hope that the morbid and vile tendencies you carry, to whatever extent they may be, are somehow changed, as you realize the gravity of who you have become.

“But make no mistake: Despite my harsh feelings about your acts, I have forgiven both of you. That, of course, doesn’t make what you did permissible. It never will be. I – along with every freedom-loving and rational person across this globe – condemn what you did in the strongest terms, but I have chosen not to allow hate to overtake my heart for either of you.

“I know that there is value in life, and I hope that you can go on living in the next life as happy as possible given what you’ve done and the heavy regret that will most certainly sit on your hearts. I hope one day that we can meet, so you can know that good has indeed come in the wake of your evil acts.

“Cordially, Mason Scott Wells, a Survivor.”

Mason’s letter left me with a key, introspective question that still lingers in my heart and mind: “Are you forgiving well?”

While that might sound like a strange way to word a question, it’s something I have continued to ponder, especially in recent weeks and months in the wake of personal and national tragedy.

Am I, at my core, forgiving to those who have wronged me – or am I harboring bitterness, anger and resentment? Seeking an answer is essential, especially in an era in which love is increasingly growing cold.

Plus, it seems like a particularly timely endeavor, considering that the celebration of Jesus’ birth is upon us. Forgiveness is many times easier said than done, especially when one’s offending acts are damaging, life-changing or violent.

But if Wells can forgive terrorists who left him with horrific burns, injuries and a long road to recovery – and if the family members of Christians who were horrifically gunned down in their places of worship can still follow Jesus’ commands and offer forgiveness – we must surely all think a bit deeper about where we stand in our own lives.

The holiday season can be a difficult time for many, especially if there are friends or family members who have harmed us or from whom we are estranged, but is anger really worth harboring? Life is short. Love is what matters.

It’s easy to hold a grudge and it’s much harder to overcome. But during a season that celebrates the very man who came to deliver forgiveness to a world that certainly doesn’t deserve it, perhaps we should all stop, think and ponder how we’re handling disappointments and conflict. And that’s exactly what Wells’ story has taught me to do. Will you join me?

Crews and her boyfriend, William Hoehn, 32, had previously pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and kidnapping in the death of Greywind.
Crews told police she arranged to have Greywind come to her apartment and told her how to induce labor.
Greywind came back two days later to give her the newborn baby, Crews said.
Hoehn told police he took garbage bags containing bloody shoes and his bloody towels and disposed of them, according to the court documents.","A North Dakota woman dubbed ""womb raider"" pleaded guilty Monday to murdering her pregnant neighbor so she and her boyfriend could steal and keep the baby.

Brooke Crews, 38, faces life in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder, and lying to law enforcement officers in the death of 22-year-old Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, of Fargo. She is expected to be sentenced on Jan 16, KVRR reported.

Crews and her boyfriend, William Hoehn, 32, had previously pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and kidnapping in the death of Greywind. Investigators haven't said how Greywind was killed, but Fargo Police Chief Dave Todd has said her death was a ""cruel and vicious act of depravity.""

Fargo police have said Greywind died of ""homicidal violence."" Crews' attorney said Monday she wanted to take responsibility for her actions, but didn't offer details on how Greywind was killed.

Defense attorney Steven Mottinger told the INFORUM newspaper the guilty plea “goes a long way in terms of us being able to argue for something less than life without parole.”

Greywind was eight months pregnant when she disappeared on Aug. 19 in Fargo. Her body was found eight days later in the Red River, wrapped in plastic and duct tape.

Authorities said after her body was found she may have been the victim of ""womb raiders"" who forcibly took her baby, the Star-Tribune reported at the time.

The baby was later found alive in the apartment where Crews and Hoehn lived, in Greywind's building.

Crews initially claimed Greywind gave up her newborn daughter, but later admitted taking advantage of the woman to get the child, according to court documents. Crews told police she arranged to have Greywind come to her apartment and told her how to induce labor. Greywind came back two days later to give her the newborn baby, Crews said.

Hoehn told police a different story, according to court documents. He said he came home on Aug. 19 to find Crews cleaning up blood in their bathroom. Hoehn said Crews presented him with an infant girl and said: ""This is our baby. This is our family.""

Hoehn told police he took garbage bags containing bloody shoes and his bloody towels and disposed of them, according to the court documents. Hoehn is scheduled for trial in March.

The baby, Haisley Jo, is now in the custody of her biological father, Ashton Matheny, who was Greywind's boyfriend, according to the Star-Tribune.

Design firm LPK has envisioned a truck tire that can be transformed into a tank-like track for off-road use.

On the road it works conventionally, spinning with the wheel it’s mounted to, but that wheel has a spoke that can be extended to stretch the very elastic tire into a teardrop shape with a large contact patch for improved traction. When it’s in this state, the wheel stops turning and electric radial actuators mounted at the end of the spokes begin to drive the tire around them via a toothed track on the inside of the rubber.

It’s part of a larger design proposal for a configurable vehicle the outfit calls the ‘ToolBOX’ that took second place in the Michelin Challenge Design, which focused on pickup trucks this year.

The third place finisher also features adjustable tires, except that these get wider. The Amazon 'X Pick' delivery truck rendered by Vinod Pakalapati can also be jacked up for rough terrain and has an extendable bed with a retractable cover to accommodate different sized loads.

Middle schooler Keaton Jones' video revealing his torment from being bullied at school went viral over the weekend. Celebrities including Chris Evans, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Gal Gadot took up his anti-bullying message, sharing the video with their huge social media followings.

Sometime during the massive outpouring of support -- the video has been viewed over 15 million times -- his mom, Kimberly Jones, set up a PayPal account where people could donate money, causing some to question her motives.

One public figure, Joe Schilling, a Bellator MMA fighter, who was touched by the young boy's heartbreaking story, reached out to Jones to invite Keaton to a show. He said he was surprised by Jones' reaction.

Schilling posted a video on Monday via Instagram with the caption, ""Go look at her ig watch her story posts she just running a money scam. Really really sad and disgusting. Tagging celebrities trying to get them to donate to her go fund me account smfh. @kimberlyjones_38 @danawhite @gracegraciefit @snoopdogg @plies.""

Schilling said in his irate Instagram post, ""I feel pretty stupid right now. I was pretty moved by Keaton Jones video so I reached out to his mom and was going to bring him out to LA for a Bellator event that's coming up, big show, and and introduce him to fighters, be his friend, and she just wants money. She just wants me to share her GoFund me account.""

Schilling said he asked Kimberly Jones during their conversation what the GoFund me account was for to which he claimed she said, ""You know Christmas is coming and I'm a single mother, blah, blah, money's tight.""

The GoFundMe account in Keaton's name has over $58,000 in donations.

But Jones is fighting back against Schilling's claims, telling Fox News they are ""untrue.""

""I did not tell him that I would rather have donations instead of the help from celebrities,"" Jones said in an Instagram direct message.

Fox News reached out to Schilling but did not receive comment.

Jones is also under fire for some alleged posts on a personal Facebook page that has since been set to private. The mom of three is pictured posing with a Confederate flag in one snap, and another picture shows her son holding an American flag while another child holds the Confederate flag.

""I've taken that down for a reason,"" Jones told Fox News of her Facebook page, without revealing what that reason is.

Jones also took to her Instagram account on Monday to defend herself against claims she is using her son's story for money.

""I love my kids: Ya'll people do not know me or my family,"" Jones wrote. ""Did y'all know that my son Keaton was spit on in school, picked on by teachers, that supposed to be there for him???

That's what I thought of when I heard the news of Matt Lauer's firing.
But to me there's a different lesson to be learned, and that is this:We are all expendable at work.
But most of work is just work, and a job can lose its luster.
When we lose our job for whatever reason—health problems, being fired or let go—we can usually get another one.","Personally, I've never been more proud of having made my family, my relationships, the focus of my life instead of my career. It wasn't easy going against the grain all those years, but it has made all the difference.

That's what I thought of when I heard the news of Matt Lauer's firing. I didn't think, ""Oh, that skunk."" Or, ""There goes another sexual predator."" No, what I thought was that ""inappropriate sexual behavior"" can mean anything. Literally, anything.

I'm not suggesting Lauer is innocent; but as he has now intimated, there's more to the story than meets the eye.

There always is.

One of the reasons he was fired is that it's easier for companies to fire people than it is to deal with the legal costs and loss of reputation that would ensue if the employee stayed.

Nevertheless, you will now hear an earful from writers and pundits about how terrible men are at their core. But to me there's a different lesson to be learned, and that is this:

We are all expendable at work. Every single one of us.

At the end of the day, a job is just a job—while at home we are irreplaceable. That's why getting the family thing down is critical, and why our lives should reflect that. Careers are, or should be, the side dish.

Sadly, that is not how we operate. Instead our culture hails work as the be all, end all—especially for women. And what do women do in response? They spend at least a decade, usually more, on their educations and career. They get tunnel vision. They believe their life's purpose will be work and thus ignore the weight of marriage and family, often until it's too late.

But careers can change. Yes, they can be rewarding. But most of work is just work, and a job can lose its luster. Or it can come to an abrupt end as it has for Matt Lauer.

And if we lose our job, one hopes to have a rock solid family to fall back on. (Something tells me that will not be the case with Lauer.) When we lose our job for whatever reason—health problems, being fired or let go—we can usually get another one. We can't say that about family. If our marriage and family breaks down, we can't just go out and create a new one.

Doesn't it make more sense, then, to make family, not work, the focus?

If you have grown children who are just beginning to map out their lives, why not use Lauer's story to teach the valuable lesson that it doesn't matter how rich or popular or successful you are in the world outside your doorstep, there will always be people who want to drag you down.

The cultural landscape is bleak. Men and women are finding it harder than ever to make love work.

Children too are suffering. As Erica Komisar writes in her new book ""Being There,"" ""Young women who have been pushed their entire lives to achieve at a high level tell me that if they step off the corporate ladder, they can never get back on at the same level. That’s true; you may never be the CEO of the bank or corporate law firm if you choose to make your family your first priority. But you may not have emotionally healthy children or have a close relationship with your children now or when they’re adults if you make your career your first priority.""

We know these things, yet we continue to talk about and emphasize work.

Work has become our drug of choice: it anesthetizes the fact that our relationships aren’t working.

So tell your kids not to make work the center of their lives—their raison d'être. Encourage them instead to focus on family. On choosing the right spouse and making good decisions where their relationships at home are concerned.

It's the best investment they'll ever make.",Suzanne Venker: Lauer's firing teaches us that everyone is replaceable at work. That's why THIS matters,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/01/suzanne-venker-lauers-firing-teaches-us-that-everyone-is-replaceable-at-work-thats-why-this-matters.html

Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, says the enlistment of transgender recruits will start Jan. 1 and go on amid the legal battles.

The Trump administration turned to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying the Pentagon still will be reviewing the policy until February but needs the emergency stay now.

“Without this relief, the military will be forced to implement a significant change to its standards for the composition of the armed forces before it decides how to resolve this issue,” the government’s motion stated. “As military leadership has explained, this timetable will place extraordinary burdens on our armed forces and may harm military readiness.”

The president over the summer announced, via Twitter, a ban on transgender service members. But the directive has been challenged since in the courts, and a federal judge last month said the U.S. military must accept them starting Jan. 1.

The new policy reflects growing legal pressure on the issue and the difficult hurdles the federal government would have to cross to enforce Trump’s demand.

Fox News previously reported that potential transgender recruits still will have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that make it possible, though difficult, for them to join the armed services.

Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, says the enlistment of transgender recruits will start Jan. 1 and go on amid the legal battles. The Defense Department also is studying the issue.

Eastburn told The Associated Press on Monday that the new guidelines mean the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. But such recruits are allowed in if a medical provider certifies they’ve been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.

Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy also must be stable on their medication for 18 months.

The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror concerns President Barack Obama’s administration laid out when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender service last year.

“Due to the complexity of this new medical standard, trained medical officers will perform a medical prescreen of transgender applicants for military service who otherwise meet all applicable applicant standards,” Eastburn said.

Aaron Belkin, director of the California-based Palm Center, an independent institute that has conducted research on sexual minorities in the military, said the 18-month timeline is fair.

“It’s a good standard because the Pentagon is treating gender dysphoria according to the same standards that are applied to all medical conditions,” he said.

However, Elaine Donnelly, president for the Center For Military Readiness, said Trump “has every right to review, revise, or repeal his predecessor’s military transgender policies, which would detract from mission readiness and combat lethality.” Court judges, she said, are not qualified to run the military.

Officials handed out masks to those who stayed behind in Montecito, an exclusive community about 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles that’s home to stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Drew Barrymore.

Forecasters predicted dry winds that spread fires throughout the region for a week would begin to lose their power Monday. Light gusts were driving the flames away from communities, Santa Barbara County fire spokesman Mike Eliason said. But the possibility of “unpredictable” gusts would keep firefighters on edge, he said.

My commute home tonight. We are safe. Others aren’t. Pray for them. A post shared by Rob Lowe (@robloweofficial) on Dec 5, 2017 at 8:43pm PST

Actor Rob Lowe wore a mask as he live-streamed his family evacuating Sunday from their smoke-shrouded home.

“Praying for the people in my area,” he said to his Instagram followers. “Hope everybody’s getting out safe like we are, and thanks for the prayers and thoughts. And good luck to the firefighters, we need you!”

Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that neighbors were helping each other and their animals get to safety.

“I’m sending lots of love and gratitude to the fire department and sheriffs. Thank you all,” she wrote.

Tens of thousands have fled their homes as flames churn through foothill towns near Santa Barbara, the latest flare-up after a week of wind-fanned wildfires throughout the region.

With acrid smoke thick in the air, even residents not under evacuation orders took the chance to leave, fearing another shutdown of a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week.

The blaze has destroyed more than 750 buildings, officials said. It was partially contained after burning nearly 360 square miles of dry brush and timber.

Customers coming into Jeannine’s American Bakery in Montecito brushed ash from their clothes and marveled at smoke so heavy that visibility was down to just a few feet.

“There’s so much ash it’s unbelievable,” manager Richard Sanchez said. “Everything is white. The streets are covered, cars are covered, our parking lot is covered.”

Amtrak canceled service through the city of Santa Barbara, and its nearly 200-year-old mission church was closed because of smoke and ash. Authorities issued repeated alerts about unhealthy air and warned people to stay indoors, avoid vigorous outdoor activities and not do anything to stir up ash.

Dr. Helene Gardner, an expert in air quality at University of California, Santa Barbara, watched ash fall “like a fine snow” from her home after the school postponed final exams until January. She said her environmental sciences students got a kick from the fact that the delay was directly related to their field of study.

Gardner warned that the air alerts should be taken seriously because of airborne particulates — “nasty buggers” that can lodge in lungs and cause respiratory problems.

She said the levels of particulates from a wildfire can approach those seen near coal-burning plants in pollution-heavy China and are especially problematic for people exerting themselves.

“When I look out my window and see someone bicycling I think, ‘No, no, no, get off your bike and walk!’” she said.

“I’m not frightened yet,” Carpinteria resident Roberta Lehtinen told KABC-TV. “I don’t think it’s going to come roaring down unless the winds kick up.”

Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region’s most disastrous wildfires. They blow from the inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.

Firefighters gained more control over other major blazes in Southern California and diverted resources to the Santa Barbara foothills to combat the enormous fire that started Dec. 4.

Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the winds. Though the state emerged this spring from a years-long drought, hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months.

High fire risk is expected to last into January.

The animation, referred to as an “optical illusion for the ears,” was first posted by HappyToast in 2008 but it regained steam Saturday when Lisa DeBruine posted on Twitter, The Telegraph said.

She asked what people experienced when they watched it in an attempt to see if anyone could explain it.

The silent GIF shows what appears to be three pylons jumping rope. But the camera shakes just as the middle one lands, which some viewers believe they can hear or feel.

Dr. DeBruine, from the Institute of Neuroscience & Psychology at the University of Glasgow -- according to The Telegraph -- heard from more than 280,000 people by Tuesday, with a large majority saying they thought they heard a thudding sound.

“My gut says the camera shake is responsible for the entire effect,” said Twitter user Jeff Weiss. “Anything that shook the camera like that, would probably make the “thud” sound.”

Another user, Andrew Kemendo said, “The brain is “expecting/predicting” what is coming visually and then fires a version of what it expects across the relevant senses. Also explains why some might “feel” a physical shake.”

In an interview with the BBC, DeBruine seems to be as stumped as everyone else.

“I don’t know why some people hear it very clearly, others only feel it, and others perceive nothing at all,” she said. “I thought some of the vision scientists I follow would be able to explain it right away, but it seems like there are several plausible explanations and no clear consensus.”",GIF of jump-roping pylons stumps the internet,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/05/gif-jump-roping-pylons-stumps-internet.html

Editor's note: this originally appeared in The Hill.

The charge to which retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty may tell us a great deal about the Robert Mueller investigation.

The first question is, why did Flynn lie? People who lie to the FBI generally do so because, if they told the truth, they would be admitting to a crime. But the two conversations that Flynn falsely denied having were not criminal. He may have believed they were criminal but, if he did, he was wrong.

Consider his request to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., to delay or oppose a United Nations Security Council vote on an anti-Israel resolution that the outgoing Obama administration refused to veto. Not only was that request not criminal, it was the right thing to do. President Obama's unilateral decision to change decades-long American policy by not vetoing a perniciously one-sided anti-Israel resolution was opposed by Congress and by most Americans. It was not good for America, for Israel or for peace. It was done out of Obama's personal pique against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rather than on principle.

Despite the banner headlines calling the Flynn guilty plea a ""thunderclap,"" I think it may be a show of weakness on the part of the special counsel rather than a sign of strength.

Many Americans of both parties, including me, urged the lame-duck Obama not to tie the hands of the president-elect by allowing the passage of a resolution that would make it more difficult to achieve a negotiated peace in the Middle East.

As the president-elect, Donald Trump was constitutionally and politically entitled to try to protect his ability to broker a fair peace between the Israelis and Palestinians by urging all members of the Security Council to vote against or delay the enactment of the resolution. The fact that such efforts to do the right thing did not succeed does not diminish the correctness of the effort. I wish it had succeeded. We would be in a better place today.

Some left-wing pundits, who know better, are trotting out the Logan Act, which, if it were the law, would prohibit private citizens (including presidents-elect) from negotiating with foreign governments. But this anachronistic law hasn't been used for more than 200 years. Under the principle of desuetude - a legal doctrine that prohibits the selective resurrection of a statute that has not been used for many decades - it is dead-letter. Moreover, the Logan Act is unconstitutional insofar as it prohibits the exercise of free speech.",Dershowitz: Why Did Flynn Lie and Why Did Mueller Charge Him with Lying?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/05/dershowitz-why-did-flynn-lie-and-why-did-mueller-charge-him-lying

“Tom Savage was twitching after that hit.","The Houston Texans were criticized after quarterback Tom Savage was allowed to re-enter Sunday’s game against the San Francisco 49ers after possibly sustaining concussion.

Savage got injured nine minutes into the second quarter. He was on the ground when both arms appeared to twitch.

Savage was taken to a medical tent and returned to the bench. Three minutes later, he went back into the field for the next series.

Savage later tried to enter the game again, but a team official kept him away, dragging his jersey and pulling him away from the field. The player was seen arguing with the official and the team’s trainer before being escorted to the locker room.

The incident raised concerns about the NFL’s procedures for evaluating such injuries and ensuring the wellbeing of the players.

Many NFL fans criticized the team for letting Savage back on the field after the hit.

“Tom Savage was twitching after that hit. May not be for 20 years, but it's stuff like that'll be the eventual downfall of the NFL,” one Twitter user posted.

Chris Nowinsk, a critic of the NFL’s handling of concussions, tweeted, “Disgusted that the Houston Texans allowed Tom Savage to return to the game after two plays after showing these horrifying concussion signs (is that a seizure?) after a head impact.”

Coach Bill O'Brien defended the decision to let Savage back in the game after the first evaluation, saying the player was cleared to return following initial evaluation for a concussion but was later sent to the locker room “because of what they saw.”

""They try to make the best decision for the player,"" the coach said. ""Whatever they see and the testing that they do they try to make the best decision with the player and they weren't satisfied with the results of the second test so they decided to pull him, and that's when he went into the locker room.""

When asked if it is troublesome that Savage was allowed to re-enter the game after the concussion, O’Brien said he does not “have anything to do with that,” adding that “All I do is coach.""

Teammates also said that there was nothing different about Savage after the hit. T.J. Yates, who took over for him, said ""When he got back to the sideline he seemed fine and coherent.”

The 49ers won the game 26-16.

Christmas brings families closer together over homemade meals, winter traditions and of course, presents. Forgo a store-bought gift and make this year more meaningful by crafting your own gifts by hand with the family. Below are 10 adorably festive ideas to delight do-it-yourselfers of all ages.

Make homemade baked treats. Whether it’s your famous gingerbread recipe or just some simple sugar cookies, get your whole family in on the baking experience. For kids that are too young to handle kitchen appliances, have them gather ingredients, measure flour or cut dough with cute cookie cutters. Bake some extras for the family to munch on and wrap the rest with a colorful ribbon and a sweet holiday note for a yummy gift.

Decorate hand-painted wood ornaments. Unfinished wood ornaments have unlimited DIY potential. Paint a holiday symbol or saying on one side or cover it in chalkboard paint and give it to your kids to doodle on. Have everyone decorate their own, sign their name and hang it up on the tree.

Fill your own ornament. Stock up on clear glass ornaments with pop-off tops and drop in leaves, glitter, confetti - anything your heart desires. To make it more personal, cut out long strips of paper for each member of the family to write a secret message, roll it up and place it inside.

Play with your food. This is the one time of the year where you can break the rules and let kids have fun with their food. As an alternative to the classic gingerbread house, you can build candy trees with foam cones and a bit of hot glue or icing. Decorate foam cones with hard candies or peppermints and save an extra special treat for the very top.

Sweet, spice and everything nice. There’s almost nothing better than having a sweet-smelling home all season long. Make your own candles by boiling soy wax flakes and add a drop or two of your favorite essential oils. Alternatively, create your own potpourri with dried fruit slices and a handful of pine cones or cinnamon sticks. Wrap them in fabric sachets to pass out as gifts or leave them in a tray on the dining room table.

Repurpose glass jars. Mason jars are extremely versatile and can be used for anything from storage to drinking glasses, but set a couple aside this month for unique Christmas crafts. Drop in a few loose tree branches and some candy canes to place around the home for a fuss-free display. You could also craft your own snow globe by gluing festive figurines to the inside of the lid, filling the jar with glitter and closing it tight. Simply turn it upside down to see snowfall wherever you are!

Make a wreath for the home. Take a nature walk with your little ones to teach them about the great outdoors and pick up any viable branches or leaves for a handmade holiday wreath. Once you get back home, arrange your foraged finds around a metal wire wreath and fasten them in place with kid-friendly plastic twist-ties.

Stamp your gifts. If you have store-bought gifts for the family, you can still have fun with the gift wrapping. Collect ink stamps and pads in your favorite designs and colors and let your kids go crazy on plain wrapping paper. You can also go a step further and show them how to stamp burlap stockings and colorful decorative pillows for a more permanent personalized touch.

Create an advent village. Try an origami-inspired DIY project for a unique spin on the age-old advent calendar. Print and cut premade templates for mini boxes and teach youngsters how to fold them. You can purchase colorful paper with a pattern or have kids decorate the sides themselves with markers and glitter. Fill each one with a special treat that will have kids looking forward to waking up every winter morning.

Make a pompom garland. This project requires a big bag of colorful pompoms, a soft yarn needle, thread and some can-do attitude. Simply poke the needle through the center of each pompom and keep going until you’re satisfied with the length. Hang these adorable garlands from open shelves around the home or over your kid’s bed to showcase their work.",10 handmade Christmas gifts for the whole family,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/12/04/10-handmade-christmas-gifts-for-whole-family.html

She claimed King squeezed her butt so hard, it left a large bruise.","Larry King is denying he groped Terry Richard, the ex-wife of late singer Eddie Fisher, on two separate red carpets.

""Larry King flatly and unequivocally denies these claims and intends to file suit and prove that they're utterly false,"" the 84-year-old's lawyer told Fox News Monday.

Terry Richard told the UK-based news and gossip site DailyMailTV on Monday that King groped her at a public event on two separate occasions. She claimed the incidents took place in 2005 and 2006, both at a baseball awards dinner at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.

Richard said she was a correspondent for the Tolucan Times in Los Angeles and was on the red carpet interviewing several baseball players for a story.

“Larry King is a groper,” said Richard. “He groped me twice. He gets a thrill doing this in front of the camera, knowing I couldn’t do anything.”

The 63-year-old claimed the first incident occurred when the pair were posing for a photo. She insisted the former CNN talk show host allegedly slid his hand down her backless dress, resting his fingers in between her buttocks.

Richard also alleged the second incident also occurred while the two were posing for a photo. She claimed King squeezed her butt so hard, it left a large bruise.

Richard, former Miss Louisiana 1973, said she first met King back in 2004.

“At that time I told Larry I was Eddie Fisher’s fourth wife and he responded in a curmudgeonly manner stomping his foot with his hands on his hips as he said to me, ‘How did you get away?’” she explained. “Then he added, ‘When are you coming on my TV show?’ I responded, ‘Not until my book is ready.’”

Then in 2005, Richard said King recognized her from their initial meeting at a baseball awards show. She added a photographer then requested to snap a photo of the pair for the Tolucan Times.

“Larry put his hand behind me on my back, and as the photographer was taking our picture Larry slid his hand down from the middle of my back to putting his hand inside of my dress and it ended up with about three or four of his fingers in the crack of my ass, resting in the crack of my ass,” she alleged. “He just stuck it in… I don’t know how he got [his hand] in there, but he did. I couldn’t believe it. I was so shocked. I froze. I let out a squelch… I just smiled there real big, I didn’t know what to do.’”

Richard added King allegedly left his fingers in between her buttocks for “about eight to ten seconds.”

“He had a big smile on his face,” she said. “I didn’t say anything, I didn’t want to cause a scene in front of everyone. My reaction was to slap him in his face, but he was the guest speaker. It was awful.”

Richard claimed the incident happened again the following year when she attended another baseball awards event. After spotting King, she attempted to avoid him, but “somehow he was right in front of my face.”

That’s when she said another photographer asked to take a photo of the duo.

“I thought since I wasn’t wearing a backless dress this time I didn’t think it was going to happen again, so I posed with him for another picture. I thought, ‘Surely, he’s not going to do anything this time,' and the old dog did.”

She alleged King tightly grabbed her butt cheek, resulting in a bruise that lasted for a week.

“He ran off with his wife down the red carpet towards the limousines,” she said. “And I just stood there shocked, thinking this must be a thing for Larry... Because of what happened to me, every time I take a picture with a man that I don’t really know, in the back of my mind, for a split second, I wonder if I’m going to be groped.""

Richard said she’s hoping that coming forward will result in an apology from King.

“How would he feel if someone did that to his wife or his daughter?” she questioned. “Larry has two young sons that I hope wouldn’t do what he did… It would be cool if he did apologize for his actions. Larry needs to take responsibility for his actions.”

Richard married Fisher in 1975, but the couple divorced a year later in 1976.

If the younger generation’s memories of holidays are solely of adults arguing over politics, they’re far more likely to grow up and continue that destructive pattern.
Encourage Family Traditions: They’re the Lifeblood of IdentityIt's through traditions that we connect with our families and engage with our heritage.
Many families have specific Thanksgiving traditions, and eagerly anticipate the annual football game in the backyard, pumpkin pie, or time spent in prayer and thanks.
Focus on the things that unite you and your family, not what divides you.","Thanksgiving should be a time to reconnect with our families and traditions. But this year may be more difficult than usual. After a politically fraught year, you and all the members of your extended family might not – and this is likely an understatement – be seeing eye-to-eye politically.

There’s a practical answer to this problem, and it’s one that I’ve seen work over and over again during my life and much of my career observing and studying families. One pattern that repeatedly emerges is that healthy, high-functioning families focus on what unites them, as opposed to picking at what divides them.

There’s some good psychological underpinning for this approach: arguing over politics usually doesn’t do any good. As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman points out, the chance of you being able to change someone’s mind on a deeply held political view is close to zero.

Since political arguments are almost never productive, take my advice – this Thanksgiving, resist the temptation to engage in them. Even an offhand mention of a recent political event or of a particular leader could quickly spoil the whole dinner.

Let me be clear: I’m not saying families should never discuss politics. Our nation is currently grappling with all kinds of incredibly difficult issues, and it’s important that families develop the ability to discuss them calmly and thoughtfully.

Thanksgiving is not the time for political debates. It’s a time to emphasize all the things that unite you as a family, and to work on developing the kinds of bonds that hold a family together.

But Thanksgiving is not the time for political debates. It’s a time to emphasize all the things that unite you as a family, and to work on developing the kinds of bonds that hold a family together.

This is particularly important for family businesses. Seventy percent of family businesses don’t endure beyond one generation – and that’s often because they’ve failed to develop the kind of family culture of tolerance and acceptance that can sustain a business through the generations.

If the younger generation’s memories of holidays are solely of adults arguing over politics, they’re far more likely to grow up and continue that destructive pattern. Instead, have the family business leaders model good behavior, such as consideration, tact and simple kindness.

Encourage Family Traditions: They’re the Lifeblood of Identity

It's through traditions that we connect with our families and engage with our heritage. Traditions are our rituals, ceremonies and the activities that we reliably do as a family through the years and across the generations.

They're an anchor in the changing sea of our life experiences. We get older, we go to school, we get jobs, people drift in and out of our lives, but our family traditions can continue through all our life stages as they continuously reinforce ""What it means to be us.""

Traditions help create a shared sense of identity and belonging, and help establish continuity between the generations. Many families have specific Thanksgiving traditions, and eagerly anticipate the annual football game in the backyard, pumpkin pie, or time spent in prayer and thanks. In my family, we spend part of the day wrapping holiday presents for disaster victims.

Tell Your Family Stories

Here again, families can learn from Thanksgiving: Each year, we tell part of our country’s story – how a courageous group of men and women braved the frigid Atlantic to find the freedom to practice their faith. This annual retelling reminds us of all that we value as Americans: freedom, bravery, tolerance and helping our neighbors.

You can do the same as a family. Retell your story. Think about where you are, where you came from, and where you’re going. And if crafting that story seems too hard or complicated, start out with some simple questions. Does everyone know who they’re named for? Do you know what your parents’ first jobs were? Do you know where your aunts and uncles grew up?

Conversations like these often turn out to be incredibly rich and rewarding – so much so that you might want to record the details people recall so as to remember them. Whether it’s making a family coffee table book – what we do every year in my family – or hiring a videographer to film interviews, it’s a worthwhile investment in your family culture.

There’s no denying that Thanksgiving, and indeed the holidays in general, can be a challenging time for families. But by intentionally using it to develop and deepen strong family bonds, you can make the most of the most wonderful time of the year.

Al Franken has promised under pressure to step down from the U.S. Senate “in the coming weeks.” He was not accused of such grave crimes as rape or preying on underage children. He was accused instead of grabbing, fondling, lunging at and humiliating seven women. If true, and I think we see a pattern here, this would make him a pig, a bully and a hypocrite. His departure, while personally sad, is no loss to American democracy.

It was not mad Puritanism that chased him from office; it was his colleagues’ finally, belatedly announcing and establishing standards of behavior. This is not an unreasonable or unhelpful thing to do.

Journalists and political figures of my generation have been wryly remembering what we had to put up with in the old days—how a woman couldn’t get on an elevator with Sen. Strom Thurmond without being pinched or patted. All true. But even Thurmond would not have survived a photo of him leering over a sleeping woman and posing—deliberately, perhaps sadistically, so the moment could be memorialized—as he grabbed or simulated grabbing her breasts, which is what Mr. Franken did. The Franken case represents not a collapse of tolerance for flawed human behavior but a rise of judgment about what is acceptable.

People speak of mixed motives and say it’s all brute politics. The Democrats are positioning themselves for the high ground should Republican Roy Moore be elected. They’re aligning themselves with the passions of their base, while clearing the way for a probe into sexual-harassment accusations against the president. New York’s Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who led the charge that forced Mr. Franken’s departure, hopes to run for president in 2020 as a champion of women, so the move was happily on-brand.

By William McGurn, The Wall Street Journal



When Alabamans go to the polls a week from now in a special election to choose their next senator, not even Mrs. Roy Moore will be rooting as hard for her Republican husband as the junior senator from Minnesota, Al Franken.

The reason is simple. Mr. Franken knows that if Mr. Moore takes his Senate seat, it becomes less likely the former “Saturday Night Live” comic will have to relinquish his. And therein lies a larger tale about how the liberal opposition to Mr. Moore may be backfiring.

Until this race, plausible accusations that a candidate had engaged in sexual conduct with girls as young as 14 would be enough to sink most any man. Coming as these charges do amid a national sexual reckoning that has already brought down many powerful men hitherto thought untouchable, they ought to be even more potent.

But Mr. Moore is not sinking. To the contrary, at last check the Real Clear Politics polling average gives him a 2.6-point lead. A CBS News poll released this past weekend has him up by 6 points.

If Mr. Moore does win, it will be despite calls by Republicans and conservatives for him to step aside. The calls have come from Republican leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, among others.

Then again, the remaining GOP support, including that of Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and now President Donald Trump, may carry more pull. Mr. Moore further benefits from the backing of the evangelical community, many of whose pastors have stuck with him.

But there’s another potent force in this race, which gets little media attention. These are the liberals who are enabling him. Let’s run through a short list:

• Bill Clinton . Remember the argument “It was only sex”? Or reporter Nina Burleigh saying she’d be happy to give then-President Clinton oral sex “just to thank him for keeping abortion legal”?

Some who backed Mr. Clinton now recognize that their unqualified support through all his lies and bad behavior leaves them in a poor position to lecture others about how to treat women, or why policy should not trump character. Now they are throwing Mr. Clinton under the bus to try to regain the moral high ground. How persuasive must Alabamans find this?

• Doug Jones. He is the Democrat in the race. When your rival is credibly accused of sexual misbehavior with underage girls, the race is yours to lose. And yet Mr. Jones is doing his best to do just that, over a classic Democratic blind spot: abortion.

Alabama is one of America’s most pro-life states. Mr. Jones might have expanded his appeal by opting for the Bill Clinton formula of “safe, legal and rare,” or supporting popular restrictions such as the ban after 20 weeks. Instead, Mr. Jones has opted for the Hillary Clinton view that abortion must be sacrosanct. If he ends up losing, abortion will be a big reason.

• Al Franken. On the hypocrisy front there’s plenty on all sides to go around. Still, it has to be hard for Alabama Republicans not to notice that they are being called on to reject their guy at a time when Democrats are keeping theirs.

• Jimmy Kimmel. Mr. Kimmel recently dispatched a comedian to heckle Mr. Moore at a rally at the Magnolia Springs Baptist Church. He succeeded in disrupting the event. Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Moore then got into a Twitter tiff after Mr. Moore suggested Mr. Kimmel put up his dukes, and Mr. Kimmel accepted.

Mr. Kimmel and his audience have had some good yucks at the expense of the local yokels. But again, just a guess that this may not be playing as well in Alabama.",Roy Moore's Liberal Enablers,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/12/05/roy-moores-liberal-enablers#commenting

The new results are calling into question previous recommendations of canola oil as a healthful alternative to saturated fats.

“Canola oil is appealing because it is less expensive than other vegetable oils, and it is advertised as being healthy,” said lead researcher Domenico Praticò, M.D. “Very few studies, however, have examined that claim, especially in terms of the brain.”

With 5.5 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s in 2017, this study has hopefully marked the start of more in-depth research on the widely used substance. Canola oil is often used for sautéing, baking, and other forms of cooking in the household and at restaurants.

The mice, which were genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer’s later in life, were split into two groups before developing any visible signs of the disease. One group was fed a typical diet while the other was fed the same diet with an additional serving of canola oil. The serving was equivalent to one to two tablespoons for a human.

After six months on the diet, mice that consumed canola oil were significantly heavier than the mice who did not. Additionally, the researchers found that the canola-consuming mice experienced significant declines in working memory, apparently having worsened the onset of their Alzheimer’s. While foods like berries and salmon seem to stave off the disease, canola oil could be making it worse.

“Even though canola oil is a vegetable oil, we need to be careful before we say that it is healthy,” said Praticò. “Based on the evidence from this study, canola oil should not be thought of as being equivalent to oils with proven health benefits.”

The researchers acknowledge that further research is needed and that this does not prove canola oil directly influences body weight in humans.

So far in recent research, it seems olive oil has the greatest variety of health benefits when compared to other oils. This is likely due to its healthy fats.",Canola oil could cause weight gain and memory loss,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/12/11/canola-oil-could-cause-weight-gain-and-memory-loss.html

The women revived their allegations during a press conference and television interview in New York City.

Trump has long rejected the accusations from over a dozen women who have made such claims against him, and the White House called the revived accusations ""false."" The three accusers spoke out Monday following high-profile resignations last week on Capitol Hill over misconduct claims.

“I ask Congress to put aside their party affiliations and ask that they investigate Trump’s history of sexual misconduct,” Rachel Crooks said during a press conference in New York City Monday. ""If they were willing to investigate Senator Franken, I think it's only fair that they do the same for Trump.""

Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., announced his resignation last week, as did Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. announced his retirement following sexual misconduct claims.

Trump's accusers on Monday also sought the president's resignation, but acknowledged that's unlikely.

“In terms of resigning, it’s probably the right thing to do. But I can’t imagine he will. I think the congressional investigation is the only thing we can ask for,"" Crooks said.

The women attracted some congressional attention. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who helped lead calls for Franken to step down, on Monday told CNN that Trump, too, “should resign” – calling the women’s claims “credible.”

Crooks gave a detailed account of her story, accusing Trump of kissing her on the lips when she was a receptionist at a company in Trump Tower when she was 22 years old.

“I was shocked. Devastated. It happened so fast,” Crooks said earlier Monday on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today.” “I wish I would have been courageous enough to be like ‘what’s going on,’ and ‘you need to stop.’…I felt horrible.”

Two other women shared their stories during the press conference and on the same program.

Jessica Leeds, who first told her story during the presidential campaign, detailed her experience on an airplane in the 1970s. Leeds said she was on a flight, and was moved to first class—a seat next to Trump.

She claimed Trump started ""kissing and groping"" her, and that she eventually moved to the back of the plane.

""Mr. Trump, he was bored and wanted some entertainment,"" she said at the press conference. Leeds said that years later, she ran into Trump in New York City, where she claimed he remembered her and called her a derogatory name.

Samantha Holvey, a former Miss USA pageant contestant, alleged that during one pageant, Trump came backstage to where the contestants were in hair and make-up in bathrobes.

“He lined us up, and I thought this was going to be like a meet and greet, like ‘hi, how are ya, nice to meet you,’ it was not,” Holvey said on NBC. “He was just looking me over like I was a piece of meat, I was not a human being, I didn’t have a brain, I didn’t have a personality. I was just simply there for his pleasure. It left me feeling very gross, very dirty. This is not what I signed up for.”

Later, at the press conference, Holvey said it was her “dream” as a young girl to compete in a pageant.

“But I have a new dream now. That this man will be held accountable for his actions,” Holvey said.

Allegations of misconduct by Trump surfaced during the 2016 presidential campaign. They took center stage in the final weeks after a decade-old “Access Hollywood” tape revealed Trump making lewd comments about women. The Trump campaign discounted the tape, at the time, as “locker room talk.”

The White House released a fresh statement early Monday decrying the ""false"" claims of the women at the press conference.

“These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement. “The timing and absurdity of these false claims speaks volumes and the publicity tour that has begun only further confirms the political motives behind them.”

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in Monday's press briefing that she would provide information from ""eyewitnesses"" who disputed some accounts of the president's accusers.

""Look, as the President said himself, he thinks it's a good thing that women are coming forward, but he also feels strongly that a mere allegation shouldn't determine the course,"" Sanders said when asked about U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley's recent comments on the matter. ""And, in this case, the President has denied any of these allegations, as have eyewitnesses. And several reports have shown those eyewitnesses also back up the President's claim in this process.""

Sanders added ""there have been multiple reports"" about ""eyewitness accounts.""

But Crooks said the White House’s response was “laughable.”

""A person with this record would have entered the graveyard of political aspirations never to return, but yet, he is president of the United States,"" she said.

Holvey, Leeds and Crooks are just three of 16 women who participated in a video titled “16 Women and Donald Trump,” which details the allegations against the president.

The “Beautiful Trauma” singer told The People that she does not want to impose traditional gender roles on her two children, six-year-old daughter Willow and 11-month-old son Jameson.

“We are a very label-less household,” the pop star said of her family with motorcycle racer Carey Hart.

“Last week Willow told me she is going to marry an African woman. I was like: ‘Great, can you teach me how to make African food?’” Pink said.

“And she’s like: ‘Sure Mama, and we are going to live with you while our house is getting ready.’”

The singer also shared her reaction to seeing a gender neutral bathroom in a school.

“I was in a school and the bathroom outside the kindergarten said: ‘Gender Neutral — anybody,’ and it was a drawing of many different shapes.”

“I took a picture of it and I wrote: ‘Progress.’ I thought that was awesome. I love that kids are having this conversation,” the 38-year-old told The People.

The singer was applauded earlier this year when she delivered a heartwarming speech at the VMAs in which she explained the true meaning of beauty to her daughter after the six-year-old told her “I’m the ugliest girl I know” and that she “looks like a boy.”

In the speech, Pink recounted the story, saying: “‘Well what do you think I look like?’ And she said, ‘Well you’re beautiful.’ And I was like, ‘Well, thanks. But when people make fun of me, that’s what they use. They say I look like a boy or I’m too masculine or I have too many opinions, my body is too strong.’”

She went on to say: “Baby girl, we don’t change. We take the gravel and the shell and we make a pearl. And we help other people to change so they can see more kinds of beauty.’”

In her latest video, for the single “Beautiful Trauma,” Pink addresses traditional gender roles by appearing as stereotypical 50s style housewife with her husband, played by Channing Tatum. When she catches Tatum dressed as a woman, she reacts with joy and the pair then dance with her in a suit and tie and him in a dress.

Meanwhile, Pink, whose real name is Alecia Moore, told The Sun that she couldn’t be a judge on “The X Factor,” ahead of a performance on the UK version of the hit reality show.

The singer revealed in an interview with The Sun that she is not suited to the job: “Would I be an X Factor judge? Nope. I’m not ­diplomatic and I wouldn’t be helpful.”

“I would be so uncomfortable the whole time because I wouldn’t want to be mean to anyone, but then I wouldn’t want to bullsh-t anyone.”

“Everyone who does it is so talented and nice — they can have it.”

However, one person Pink does has rude words for is US President Donald Trump, reports The Sun.

Earlier this week she tweeted that actor Jeremy Piven was more heavily punished for sexual misconduct allegations than the US President.

When asked about her ­political views, the star said: “The world the way it is now is dicey, dicey. It’s crazy times.”

“Every morning I wake up, throw my hands up in the air and I’m like, ‘F-cking unbelievable, this is unbelievable.’

“What’s my reaction to Trump? Simply f-cking unbelievable.”

“There is no good stuff with him, no good stuff at all. There’s zero there. I just want this part over so we can get to the clean-up operation.”
