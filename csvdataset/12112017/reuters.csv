Prime Minister Theresa May’s last-minute deal with the European Union reduces the chances of a chaotic divorce but exposes the difficulty of preserving trade flows after the separation. A lengthy transition period will create further scope for May – or another prime minister – to make concessions.

The first phase of Brexit talks was supposed to be straightforward. In reality, the six-month negotiation was punctuated by British compromises. Despite initial protestations, the government will pay a divorce bill that UK officials estimate will be between 40 billion and 45 billion euros. It also conceded that the European Court of Justice can rule on disputes involving EU citizens for up to eight years after Britain leaves.

The biggest climbdown, however, was over the border with the Republic of Ireland. Ministers had insisted it was possible to leave the EU’s single market and customs union without reintroducing a hard border. That was exposed as naive. Decisions on a detailed plan are deferred to the next stage of the talks. In the absence of a solution, however, the UK has committed to maintaining “full alignment” with the EU rules required to keep the border open.

The tussle is a preview of the issue likely to dominate the next phase of the talks: Britain’s willingness to comply with EU regulations after quitting the bloc. May wants an ambitious pact, but also insists on her country’s right to determine its own future. Officials in Brussels say that means London may have to settle for an agreement like the one the EU has with Canada. Even that could prove tricky since all 27 remaining EU nations will have to approve it.

Fully resolving this question by March 2019, when Britain is due to leave, looks impossible. A transition period, initially of two years, will buy time to agree details. Once in place, that limbo could easily be extended. May might then make further concessions – or be replaced by a prime minister not bound by the same “red lines”. Reversing the referendum decision still looks unlikely. But the chances of Britain leaving the EU in name only will continue to grow.",Breakingviews - Britain heads for Brexit in name only,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-breakingviews/breakingviews-britain-heads-for-brexit-in-name-only-idUSKBN1E21KT

It’s still unclear who will end up running Zimbabwe. But whoever prevails will need the backing of both the military as well as China, Zimbabwe’s primary foreign investor.

By Thursday, reports indicated the 93-year-old Mugabe was still trying to persuade top generals that he should be allowed to serve out his presidential term until elections next year. The generals were believed to favor handing power to Mugabe’s former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Here are some key lessons from what we now know:

1. China is emerging as a key powerbroker on the continent.

Nobody in Beijing or Harare is saying whether China was told in advance about plans for the takeover. Shortly before Zimbabwean tanks took to the streets, however, the Chinese Defense Ministry made a point of reporting that Zimbabwe’s top military commander had met with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing the previous week.

The news was widely reported, particularly in southern Africa, alongside the breaking coup developments. Many regional observers suspect China, which backed guerrilla fighters from Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union movement during its war against then-Rhodesia’s white minority regime, was in the loop on events in Harare, and broadly supportive.

With Beijing strikingly increasing its holdings in sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade, expect this kind of signaling to be a key part of events on the continent from now on.

2. No autocrat lasts forever.

Described by a U.S. ambassador as a “brilliant tactician,” Mugabe was regarded as one of the great survivors of international politics. Charming and utterly ruthless, he was willing to use ethnic division, death squads, media manipulation and a host of other unsavory tools to crush all opponents. In 2008, his main rival withdrew from a runoff vote after government forces beat, killed or intimidated thousands of opposition voters.

Ironically, he’s now been undone by the same advancing years that once protected him from internal challengers who previously seemed content to wait for time to take its toll. Since he entered his 90s, this dynamic changed as it became clearer that Grace Mugabe, an ambitious woman more than 30 years her husband’s junior, was angling for her own shot at the presidency. The scheming and backstabbing culminated last week in the firing of Vice President Mnangagwa – a onetime favorite as Mugabe’s successor – in what was seen as a move to strengthen Grace Mugabe.

3. “Keeping it in the family” isn’t always possible.

Trying to transfer power to a close family member is hardly an unusual strategy for an ailing potentate. In countries that are not constitutional monarchies, however, it can be a divisive or impossible process.

Dubbed “Gucci Grace” within Zimbabwe for her reported shopping habits, Mugabe’s wife was never popular. Perhaps more importantly, her growing influence alienated and upset established figures in the ruling Zanu-PF party and government structure. They were clearly beginning to move against her before last week’s ouster of Mnangagwa.

Nor are the Mugabes the only dominant family in Africa to have had a bad week. Earlier this year, Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos handed power to his deputy after 37 years in office as part of the deal that also put his daughter Isabel in charge of state oil firm Sonangol. It lasted less than three months – she was fired on Wednesday in a move analysts said was a clear attempt by new incumbent João Lourenço to trim family power.

4. Entrenched power structures are just that. Entrenched.

When he was ousted from office last week, it briefly looked like the end of the road for Mnangagwa. Now, the man sometimes nicknamed the “Crocodile” looks likely to be handed power by the actions of the Army.

This is not a uniquely Zimbabwean situation. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is in many respects a similar character, a senior Army official who projected himself as a safe pair of hands through the chaos that followed the ouster of Hosni Mubarak and his sons.

These individuals are not just bright, ambitious characters who have waited in the wings for decades. They also have access to an entire generation of similar figures with similar frustrations. That can make for a powerful network when it comes to this kind of situation and a need for sudden, decisive action.

5. Imagery and narrative are crucial.

The speed and success of the military takeover in Zimbabwe contrasts dramatically with the July 2016 attempted coup in Turkey. Then, a relatively small group of military officers attempted to move against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Taking on a leader who was at the peak of his powers rather than an ailing nonagenarian, they faced a tougher task than their Zimbabwean counterparts. But the Turkish plotters also failed to seize key government buildings and allowed Erdogan to address the nation and coordinate with still-loyal military units.

In Zimbabwe, the military appears to have been united. Little force was used – and in at least one case, a poorly-maintained tank was unable to make it to the capital. None of that particularly mattered. The speed with which Mugabe was contained, the television appearance of a military spokesman and the visible presence of armored vehicles on streets was enough to show that the political reality had changed.

Whoever takes over in Zimbabwe now will need the backing of the military, but that doesn’t mean those behind the seizure of power can expect a free rein. By Thursday, China’s closely watched state-run “Global Times” was warning that prolonged instability in Zimbabwe might deter further Chinese investment.

Greta Gerwig, who made her solo directorial debut with the warmly reviewed coming-of-age tale “Lady Bird,” was snubbed in a category in which Scott, Guillermo del Toro, Martin McDonagh, Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg were nominated.

Patty Jenkins, who delivered box office superhero smash “Wonder Woman,” was also left out, along with directors Dee Rees, of Netflix Inc’s racial period drama “Mudbound,” and Kathryn Bigelow, of the racially charged drama “Detroit.”

“It’s a terrible shame, to be honest,” said McDonagh, who wrote and directed small-town drama “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” “I know there have been great screenplays by women recognized this year but not directing, and maybe that will change in the Oscars.”

Gerwig, 34, was nominated for best screenplay for writing “Lady Bird,” which also landed two acting nods for its star, Saoirse Ronan, and supporting actress, Laurie Metcalf.

Metcalf told Reuters that Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” set was collaborative and stress-free.

“I‘m spoiled rotten,” Metcalf said. “She just made it a beautiful and personal experience for the entire cast and crew.”

Spacey issued an apology for the first reported incident, involving actor Anthony Rapp. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegations.

“I am especially proud that the beautiful performances of Michelle and Chris were celebrated today,” Scott said in an emailed statement. “Despite the unexpected challenges we encountered after shooting was completed, we were determined that audiences around the world would be able to see our film.”

Other surprises included Vietnamese-American actress Hong Chau for her breakout role in the best supporting actress race for futuristic comedy “Downsizing.”

Other key snubs included Amazon’s interracial romantic comedy “The Big Sick,” which failed to land any nominations, especially for its star Kumail Nanjiani, who wrote the film with his real-life wife on the circumstances that brought them together.","Female directors snubbed, Plummer surprises at Golden Globe nominations",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1E529R-OCAEN

One of the Cold War’s strangest dramas began in 1965 when Charles Robert Jenkins, then a 24-year-old army sergeant nicknamed “Scooter” from tiny Rich Square in North Carolina, disappeared one January night while on patrol near the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.

At an emotional court martial in Japan in 2004, Jenkins - who had never gone to high school - said he deserted to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and escape combat in Vietnam.

“It was Christmas time, it was also cold and dark. I started to drink alcohol. I never had drunk so much alcohol,” he said in a thick Southern accent, choking back sobs.

He drank 10 beers, took his men on patrol and told them to wait while he checked the road below. He then walked towards North Korea, holding a rifle with a white t-shirt tied around it. He said he had planned to go to Russia and turn himself in, and had not expected North Korea to keep him.

While in North Korea, where he taught English to soldiers and portrayed an evil U.S. spy in a propaganda film, Jenkins met and married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman 20 years his junior who had been kidnapped by North Korea to help train spies.

Fear for his safety and the family he built with Soga made it impossible to refuse any demands made on him, Jenkins said.

“You don’t say no to North Korea. You say one thing bad about Kim Il-sung and then you dig your own hole, because you’re gone,” Jenkins told his court martial, referring to the founder of the secretive state.

Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins followed with their two North Korean-born daughters in 2004.

After serving a token 30-day sentence for desertion, Jenkins moved with his family to Sado, Soga’s rural hometown, late in 2004. He subsequently worked in a gift shop and wrote a book about his experiences in North Korea.

A Sado town official confirmed his death, but could give no further details.

Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water,” a magical drama about a relationship between a strange river creature and a mute cleaner, collected a leading seven nods, including best drama, and director and acting nominations for Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins.

“Above all, ‘The Shape of Water’ is about love overcoming fear and embracing the Other,” Del Toro said in a statement.

“The Post,” Steven Spielberg’s pertinent drama about press freedom, followed with six nominations. The other nominees for the top best drama prize are British World War Two tale “Dunkirk,” gay romance “Call Me By Your Name” and the quirky dramedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”

The Golden Globes are chosen by about 90 journalists belonging to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but they often foreshadow picks for the Oscars, the movie industry’s highest awards.

“The Shape of Water” and “The Post” are also among front-runners for Oscars in March. the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announces its own nominations on Wednesday.

“Call Me By Your Name” took 10 years to get made. It also brought first-time Golden Globe nominations for actors Timothee Chalamet, 21, and Armie Hammer, 31. Chalamet also appears in another Golden Globes contender, “Lady Bird,” though he was not nominated for that role.

The Italian director of “Call Me By Your Name,” Luca Guadagnino, in a statement called it “a great cinematic romance that challenged conventions and proved that love is love.”

Mother-daughter comedy “Lady Bird” got four nods, including for its star, Saiorse Ronan, and Laurie Metcalf, in her supporting role as the title character’s mother. However, first-time director Greta Gerwig was snubbed in an all-male list for that category.

Other best comedy or musical film nominees included James Franco’s ”The Disaster Artist,“ about the making of the 2003 box office bomb ”The Room; “Get Out,” a satire on modern race relations set within a psychological thriller, the P.T. Barnum musical “The Greatest Showman” and the ice-skating mockumentary “I, Tonya.”

Australian actress and producer Margot Robbie, in her first Golden Globe nod, also was nominated for her starring role in “I, Tonya,” which tells the story of Tonya Harding and the infamous 1994 attack on rival U.S. figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. Allison Janney was nominated for playing Harding’s mother.

“There were a lot of people who said this project was impossible to make. I‘m really glad we didn’t listen to them,” Robbie, 27, told Reuters.

Movie studio Twentieth Century Fox and its Fox Searchlight unit for independent film dominated the nominations, sharing a total of 27 nods.

British actor Gary Oldman, 59, said he was “amazed, flattered and very proud” of his first Golden Globe nomination for his role as British wartime leader Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour.”

Triple Oscar winner Day-Lewis was recognized for “Phantom Thread,” which he has said will be his last as an actor.

Other first-time Golden Globe movie nominees included Britain’s Daniel Kaluuya for his breakout role in “Get Out,” Sam Rockwell as a dim-witted police officer in “Three Billboards,” and Vietnamese-American actress Hong Chau for her role as a dissident maid in “Downsizing.”

For television, British royal series ”The Crown,“ ”Game of Thrones,“ ”The Handmaid’s Tale, “Stranger Things” and “This Is Us” will compete for the best drama series award.

New Democratic premier John Horgan said he was continuing with the Site C project with “a heavy heart” but that cancelling it would cause electricity rates to rise and cost C$4 billion ($3 billion) due to money already spent and remediation costs, reducing funds to invest in schools and hospitals.

“This is not a project that we favor, or a project that we would have started,” Horgan told reporters.

The project, which would provide enough electricity for about 450,000 homes a year, would flood more than 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres or about 19 square miles) of land in northeast British Columbia, spurring opposition from local farmers and indigenous groups.

Moving forward with Site C is a “major setback to reconciliation,” Assembly of First Nations national chief Perry Bellegarde said in a statement, adding that the “next step will be legal challenges”.

Andrew Weaver, the leader of the BC Greens, which is helping prop up the minority NDP government, said it was “fiscally reckless” to continue with the project.

Horgan said that the C$10.7 billion, a new cost estimate revealed on Monday and up on a previous C$9 billion, could be paid back over many years from electricity payments. By comparison, the C$4 billion cancellation cost would have to be written off immediately, hurting provincial finances.

Monday’s decision follows a review by the British Columbia Utilities Commission that found the massive project was already over budget and a year behind schedule.

The NDP government, which came to power in July, had requested the review to help it decide whether the project should go ahead.

British Columbia’s former Liberal government approved Site C in 2014, saying it would help meet a surge in electricity needs over the next 20 years.

Companies from around the world are involved in the construction. Peace River Hydro Partners, jointly owned by Acciona SA (ANA.MC) and Samsung C&T Corp (028260.KS), was awarded a civil works contract, and is bidding for another contract. Aecon Group (ARE.TO) is part of a venture bidding on a contract.

Atco Ltd (ACOx.TO) was awarded a contract for worker accommodations, while privately held German company Voith Hydro won a contract for turbines and generators.

Britain’s opposition Labour party says it may move parts of the central bank to Birmingham. That may appeal to voters, but both the BBC and HSBC have found relocating out of the capital expensive and difficult. The idea also ignores the reason London exerts such a strong pull.

The proposal in a report commissioned by Labour financial policy chief John McDonnell fits the party’s radical image. McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have been rattling British business in recent months with proposals to renationalise railways, energy companies and postal services. Now they want to shake up financial services.

The new proposal suggests sending parts of the Bank of England to other cities like Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, Newcastle and Plymouth. The idea is that moving the central bank would prompt private institutions – and jobs – to follow. Redistributing some of the 48 billion pounds that the City of London contributed to Britain’s national income in 2014 – about 3 percent of the total – would help ease regional inequality.

This ignores the cluster effect at work in the City, though. The global and domestic banks that gather in the historic financial centre benefit from the plumbing that has evolved over centuries. Law firms, consultants and institutional investors are all close at hand. Companies pay a premium in terms of office costs and salaries to be near this pool of expertise.

HSBC is a prime example of the kind of challenges that await Labour’s proposal. Europe’s largest bank has faced an uphill battle to persuade 1,000 staff to move from London to the new headquarters of its UK subsidiary in Birmingham. This is despite sweeteners including help with property and schools in Britain’s second-largest city. Similarly, the BBC initially struggled to convince its staff to make the move to new studios near Manchester.

As Feaver told me in an interview that followed his Senate testimony, the president could order additional controls on nuclear decision making.","From the beginnings of the 2016 general election through the presidential debates and on to his “fire and fury” comments on North Korea this summer, the prospect of a president as impulsive as Donald Trump in command of nuclear weapons has worried experts in both parties and career military and government officials. This week’s North Korean test of a missile that might be able to reach the entire U.S. mainland with a nuclear warhead — and Trump’s initial response that “we will take care of it” — can hardly be expected to diminish the anxiety.

The simmering concern had already reached a medium boil last week when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony on the president’s authority to order a nuclear attack. The Senate hearing came at the behest of committee chairman Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who, since announcing he would not run for reelection next year, has publicly fretted that Trump’s intemperate tweets and other public pronouncements risk putting the United States “on the path to World War III.” A Democratic member of the committee, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, echoed those concerns during the hearing, saying, “the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests.”

But as the Senate hearing and subsequent commentary made clear, concern about Trump’s authority to launch an unwarranted first-strike nuclear attack is one thing; circumscribing that authority is quite another. The president holds the constitutional position of commander in chief and is obligated to protect the United States from foreign threats. The Constitution does grant to Congress the power to declare war, but it is unclear whether a law that significantly constrained the president’s nuclear command authority — particularly when the United States or it allies are under attack or in imminent danger of attack — would be constitutional. Also, as former National Security Council staffer and Duke political science professor Peter Feaver noted in his Senate testimony, legislation that attempts to alter the nuclear chain of command could have unintended and dangerous consequences, perhaps leading adversaries and allies to question the United States’ ability to respond quickly during a crisis.

Daniel DePetris: Why the U.S. shouldn't send arms to Ukraine

There are ways out of this constitutional and legislative dilemma, at least as regards a first nuclear strike by U.S. forces. The difficulty is that they require the participation of Trump himself.

In recent months, a bill proposed by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Ted Lieu of California — the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017 — has gained support from experts and activists concerned by Trump’s control of U.S. nuclear weapon use. The bill would prohibit the president from conducting “a first-use nuclear strike unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a congressional declaration of war expressly authorizing such strike.” But the Lieu-Markey bill — in my opinion an admirable effort to create a check against wanton nuclear war-making — is sponsored by two liberal Democrats and has approximately zero chance of passing the current Republican-controlled Congress.

If effective congressional action is unlikely in the short term, what might work to reassure government officials of both parties and the citizens they represent? The answer is that the president could take executive action that circumscribes his own authority to launch a nuclear first strike.

There is nothing to stop U.S. presidents from reining in their own nuclear command authority. When the United States is not under (or at imminent threat of) nuclear attack, the nuclear command and control system already contains some restraints on presidential authority, including military commanders trained to make sure that a nuclear launch order is legal. As Feaver told me in an interview that followed his Senate testimony, the president could order additional controls on nuclear decision making. “I don’t think that you could impose over a determinately hostile executive branch a legislative fix that actually would work,” he said. “But [Congress] could cooperate with the executive branch on legislative fixes, and better yet, it could, through oversight and review, make recommendations that the executive branch would adopt on its own, recognizing that they’re worth doing.”

Just as the Obama administration laid out strict guidelines for authorizing drone attacks on terrorist targets, Feaver said, the Trump administration could adopt a policy that, for example, required certain cabinet members to determine whether a president’s first-strike nuclear order is legal and complies with U.S. treaty obligations before it can be acted on.

An executive order formally requiring that, for example, the secretaries of defense and state sign off on any presidential order of a first nuclear strike before it is sent to military commanders would go a great way toward assuaging concerns about presidential impulsiveness — particularly at a time when the North Korea confrontation looms large in the public consciousness. Such a “three-key” reform could therefore be of enormous political benefit to Trump, reassuring both domestic audiences and allied countries that he will not explode early some morning and, after an angry tweet or two, order up an attack on Pyongyang that triggers doomsday.

To have credibility, any such reforms would need to be closely vetted by congressional and military experts. They would have to ensure that while the presidential power to initiate first-strike attacks could be curbed, presidents could still respond immediately and effectively when the United States is under attack, or an attack is clearly impending. In matters pertaining to the continued existence of humanity, details matter.

Because they would be enacted by executive order, the reforms of course would not necessarily outlive the Trump administration; a future president could undo them by fiat.

But if they were wisely crafted, procedural safeguards against a president’s unilateral misuse of his authority to order a first nuclear strike would likely be welcomed by people in America and around the world, and those safeguards might serve as a powerful precedent. Beyond the political benefits these reforms would provide Trump today, they could serve as a long-term legacy for a president who so far has struggled to get major legislation passed.

Trump’s personality and leadership style make it highly unlikely that he’ll agree to limit his own powers. But if he doesn’t want to make such a move, it’s time to start thinking about how to persuade his successor to think differently about control of the nuclear button.",Commentary: Can Congress stop a president waging nuclear war?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mecklin-nuclear-commentary/commentary-can-congress-stop-a-president-waging-nuclear-war-idUSKBN1DU2HW

>> Exclusive details in a vaccine scandal that's rocked the Philippines. When an official plan for Dynavax was announced last year, it seemed like a breakthrough. 1 million children immunized for a potentially lethal tropical virus. But documents seen by Reuters can now reveal caution from local experts was ignored before the program was rolled out to hundreds of thousands of kids.

As Reuter's Tom Allard explains, officials overlooked some critical red flags.>> The expert panel that was advising the Department of Health made a key finding and that was that it had not yet been established that this Dynavax vaccine was either safe, cost effective, or effective as a vaccine.

This led them to provide a stringent list of conditions to their approval after all that.>> Fast forward nearly two years and the program lies in tatters. Suspended last month after drug firm Sanofi said the vaccine could actually increase the risk of severe dangy in recipients who were not previously infected by the virus.

The scandal has damaged the perception of public health among Filipinos.>> As one expert told me, it's like going back to ground zero to educate people that vaccines are actually good. There's a lot of fear because there's incomplete information coming out of the Department of Health about how many people have fallen sick or even died because of this vaccine.",Philippines defied experts' advice on dengue vaccine,https://www.reuters.tv/v/JUh/2017/12/11/philippines-defied-experts-advice-on-dengue-vaccine

About a quarter of flights at Europe’s biggest airport London Heathrow were canceled, a spokeswoman for the airport said, adding that Sunday’s disruption had caused a knock-on effect, leaving planes and crews in the wrong places.

Hundreds of flights at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport were delayed, while the regional airport of Eindhoven shut completely, cancelling all flights.

Heavy snowfall in the Netherlands led to the closure of schools and businesses and prompted authorities to advise people to stay home. Rail and road networks were hit by icy weather, with some areas expected to get up to 30 cm (12 inches) of snowfall within 24 hours.

Winter enthusiasts took advantage of the rare thick snow, with some out on skis, while school children enjoyed an unexpected day off.

The national Dutch weather institute KNMI issued its highest alert, warning of “extremely dangerous” conditions across the country.

The national railroad operator and government advised people not to take the train or drive if they could avoid it, with up to 15 cm of snowfall expected on Monday afternoon.

Travel was substantially disrupted for a second day across much of Britain, as wintry showers continued following heavy snow on Sunday.

Train services across Wales, central and northern England as well as commuter services into London were severely disrupted. Drivers were warned of treacherous driving conditions with motoring organization the RAC saying that they were expecting to handle 11,000 breakdowns by the end of the day.

Opposition coalition NASA had planned to publicly “inaugurate” Odinga at a rally on Tuesday, Kenyan independence day, in what the attorney general said this week would be an act of treason.

Kenyatta was re-elected as Kenya’s president with 98 percent of the vote in a repeat election held on Oct. 26 which Odinga boycotted. He had beaten Odinga in the original poll, held in August, which was nullified by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds following opposition allegations of vote-rigging and other malpractices.

NASA said in a statement it would postpone the swearing-in after “consultations and engagement with a wide range of national and international interlocutors”. It did not specifically name any mediators involved in the talks.

The coalition said it would be announcing a new date for the swearing in ceremony and the launch of its People’s Assembly “as well as a more vigorous and prolonged resistance”.

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.29 a barrel at 0253 GMT, up 60 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last close.

That marks the first time Brent has risen above $65 since June, 2015.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $58.30 a barrel, up 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement.

“Brent crude raced higher ... as news broke that the North Sea’s Forties Pipeline system would have to be shut down for a ‘number of weeks’ after a hairline crack was found in it,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “The pipeline ... is a significant component underpinning the Brent benchmark.”

Britain’s Forties oil pipeline, the country’s largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were revealed.

“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.

GOING WIDE

The jump in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices to almost $7 a barrel, up from around $5 last week, making U.S. oil exports more attractive. CL-LCO1=R

The cheaper WTI is also a result of rising U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.71 million bpd, levels not seen since the early 1970s.

U.S. production is now also not far off that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The rising U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, to support prices by withholding supplies.

Le “MCO” est un sujet de préoccupation de longue date pour les armées : la disponibilité des matériels s‘est fortement dégradée depuis les années 2000, phénomène qui s‘est accentué avec le rythme soutenu des opérations extérieures depuis 2011.

La ministre des Armées l‘a rappelé lundi lors d‘une visite à la base aérienne 105 d‘Evreux, moins d‘un appareil militaire sur deux est aujourd‘hui en France “en mesure d‘effectuer la mission pour laquelle il a été conçu et acheté, souvent cher”.

Les coûts de maintenance annuels ont augmenté de 25% en cinq ans, de 3,2 milliards d‘euros en 2012 à 4 milliards en 2017, une facture colossale dans un contexte budgétaire contraint.

“Payer plus pour voler moins, ce n‘est pas précisément une situation à laquelle je me résous”, a déclaré Florence Parly, ancienne secrétaire d‘Etat au Budget, lors d‘un discours devant des personnels de l‘armée et des industriels de l‘aéronautique.

Dans l‘aéronautique, le taux d‘usure des matériels soumis lors des “Opex” à de rudes conditions climatiques et géologiques est significatif d‘une armée à la limite de la “surchauffe”, selon le terme de la Cour des comptes.

Au Levant et en Afrique, l‘armée doit faire face par exemple à une surconsommation de moteurs et pales pour les hélicoptères et d‘hélices pour les avions de transport, Transall notamment, à cause du sable et de la poussière. Les hélicoptères sont particulièrement vulnérables aux “posés poussière” (non sur une piste en dur) et aux stationnements sur des terrains sablonneux.

AUGMENTER LE PARC? “ILLUSOIRE”

Autre problème relevé notamment par la commission de la Défense nationale et des forces armées de l‘Assemblée, les coques radar des Mirage 2000 et des Rafale ne sont pas épargnées par les nombreux ravitaillements en vol que nécessite la configuration des théâtres d‘opérations, comme en Jordanie.

Flottes anciennes comme récentes sont affectées, réduisant considérablement la disponibilité des matériels. “C‘est un équipage qui ne s‘entraîne pas, ce sont des pilotes qui perdent leurs qualifications”, a expliqué la ministre.

Florence Parly a souligné que le coût d‘heure de vol de l‘hélicoptère Caracal, mis en service en 2005 par Airbus Helicopters, était passé de quelque 19.000 euros en 2012 à 34.000 euros en 2016, “soit une augmentation de 81% (...) pour une disponibilité amputée d‘un cinquième”.

Quant aux aéronefs “historiques”, l‘amiral Christophe Prazuck, chef d‘état-major de la marine, s‘inquiétait récemment de la vétusté des Alouette III, hélicoptères en service depuis les années 60 “sur lesquels volait Fantomas!”. “L‘entretien d‘un Alouette coûte entre 5.000 euros et 13.000 euros, c‘est trop”, a-t-il déploré devant des journalistes.

“Lequel d‘entre nous, pour son usage personnel, accepterait de devoir acquérir quatre voitures pour disposer de la certitude de pouvoir en conduire une, mais pas davantage, en payant de plus en plus cher son garagiste?”, s‘est interrogée la ministre.

Refusant d‘opter pour “une illusoire et onéreuse augmentation de parc”, elle juge qu‘une rationalisation du MCO et de sa gouvernance, trop “complexes”, trop “segmentés”, peut permettre de redresser la barre.

“FACTEURS D‘AMÉLIORATION”

“Les Anglais l‘ont bien fait. On peut gagner 30 points de disponibilité”, a assuré lundi à des journalistes l‘ingénieur Christian Chabbert, ex-directeur du service de la maintenance aéronautique et auteur d‘un rapport sur la question.

Sur la base de ces réflexions, la ministre a décidé que la SIMMAD, structure interarmées chargée du maintien en condition opérationnelle aéronautique, serait transformée en Direction de la maintenance aéronautique le 1er mars 2018 pour piloter les contrats de maintenance.

“La conception de nos équipements neufs doit désormais être systématiquement pensée en intégrant leur future maintenance, dont les coûts excèdent bien souvent le prix d‘achat”.

Dans cette perspective, Florence Parly a adressé un rappel à l‘ordre aux industriels afin qu‘ils “se sentent concernés par la disponibilité des aéronefs qu‘ils construisent”. “Nous achetons pour voler, pas pour stocker”.

“Est-ce trop demander? Mesdames et messieurs les industriels, je vous pose, avec franchise et très directement, cette question”, a-t-elle dit en présence notamment d‘Eric Trappier, PDG de Dassault Aviation, des dirigeants de Safran, Airbus et Airbus Helicopters.

Une source militaire insiste : “Les industriels privés doivent transcender leur modèle économique, voir au-delà des dix ans d‘un programme”.

“Le MCO, on sait ce que c‘est, on est tout à fait à l‘aise sur la question, même si rien n‘est jamais parfait”, a commenté Eric Trappier. “La ministre crée une dynamique, on a des solutions, on va apporter des facteurs d‘amélioration”, a-t-il dit à Reuters.",Parly s'empare du chantier de la maintenance militaire,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1E527P-OFRTP

O caso refere-se à primeira denúncia que o então procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, ofereceu no final de junho contra Temer e Rocha Loures ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) em que o ex-assessor recebeu uma mala com 500 mil reais de Ricardo Saud, da J&F, ofertado por Joesley Batista.

Essa verba, segundo a denúncia, seria parte dos 38 milhões de reais que o grupo empresarial iria pagar a Temer e representantes para assegurar apoio do governo a iniciativas da J&F. A Câmara dos Deputados, entretanto, suspendeu em agosto a parte contra o presidente, mas o STF decidiu fatiar o caso e mandar a parte de Rocha Loures para a primeira instância.

Na decisão, o juiz federal Jaime Travassos Sarinho, da 10ª Vara do Distrito Federal, disse que a “possibilidade jurídica do pedido é indiscutível, tendo em vista que os fatos narrados na denúncia, em tese, constituem crime”.

“Igualmente, verifico que há substrato probatório mínimo que sustenta a inicial acusatória, existindo, portanto, justa causa para a deflagração da ação penal. A inicial acusatória traz narrativa coerente de eventos sequenciais que teriam resultado no recebimento pelo acusado, pessoalmente, de vantagem indevida no valor de 500.000 reais, ofertada por Joesley Mendonça Batista, proprietário do Grupo J&F, cuja entrega foi realizada por Ricardo Saud, executivo do mesmo grupo empresarial”, citou o magistrado.

O juiz afirmou ainda que o pedido de suspensão do caso feito por Rocha Loures não paralisa o curso do caso porque ele advém de uma decisão do STF. Ele disse que o recurso pendente do Supremo --que pediu para um colegiado da corte avaliar se a denúncia contra o ex-assessor também tem de ficar paralisada por ter conexão com Temer-- não tem efeito suspensivo. Nesta quarta-feira, o Supremo deve analisar esse e outros recursos que querem suspender o andamento de investigações na primeira instância contra denunciados juntamente com o presidente.

Rocha Loures terá 10 dias para apresentar resposta escrita à acusação, por meio de advogado. Ele poderá, entre outras providências, pedir a apresentação de provas e convocação de testemunhas em sua defesa.

The latest promising news came from China where banks doled out a surprisingly generous dose of credit in November, which could bode well for a pick up in retail sales and industrial output due later in the week.

There was no lasting market impact from an explosion in New York’s busy Port Authority commuter hub which New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described as an “attempted terrorist attack.”

Investors continued their policy vigil with the Federal Reserve set to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

The last time the spread was that plump was in 1999.

Yet the euro is currently up 12 percent on the dollar this year, while the dollar is down 8 percent on a basket of currencies .DXY - an indication interest rate differentials aren’t everything in forex.

On Tuesday, the euro was steady at $1.1768 EUR= having failed to clear resistance around $1.1812 overnight. The dollar was idling at 113.48 yen JPY=, just off a one-month top of 113.69.

Dealers at Citi noted interbank volumes in the forex market had been 35 percent below average overnight and another thin session was likely on Tuesday.

There was a little more action in bitcoin, which was last at $16,350 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP while its newly minted futures contract <0#XBT:> fell back to $17,800.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) will start offering customer services based out of the northern Chinese city of Ningxia in partnership with local firm Ningxia Western Cloud Data Technology Co Ltd (NWCD), the U.S. firm said.

“AWS has formed a strategic technology collaboration with NWCD, and NWCD operates and provides services from the AWS China Ningxia Region, in full compliance with Chinese regulations,” Amazon said in a statement.

The move comes a month after AWS said it will sell the hardware assets of its Beijing-registered cloud unit for up to 2 billion yuan ($302.06 million) to its partner Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd to comply with new regulations.

China launched strict new regulations in June that require foreign firms to store data locally and outsource hardware elements to local partners.

Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with domestic companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, opening dozens of new data centers in just the past year.

Chinese firms account for roughly 80 percent of total cloud services revenue in China, according to Synergy Research Group.

Macron unveiled the “Make our Planet Great Again” grants after President Donald Trump in June said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was brokered in Paris in 2015.

Macron repeatedly tried to persuade the U.S. leader to reverse his decision. In a statement, the Elysee Palace said 13 of the initial 18 grants will be awarded to scientists based in the United States.

“You will now settle in, develop projects, enrich French, European research, because we’ve decided to give even bigger resources and to fully recognize what you are doing,” Macron said in a speech at Station F, a start-up incubator in Paris.

Macron was addressing the winners of the grants, some of whom attended his speech. Prominent U.S. universities, including Princeton, Stanford and Harvard, were among those from which the winning researchers were selected, the presidency said.

Macron said in a CBS News interview on Monday the U.S. decision to unilaterally quit the Paris accord had provided an impulse for action by governments and the private sector.

“OK, we have to react and do something, because it’s impossible to leave this all to - a sort of dismantling of the Paris agreement,” he told the U.S. network in Paris.

But he called the withdrawal “extremely aggressive” and said Trump’s offer to renegotiate the accord was not an option.

“I‘m not ready to renegotiate, but I‘m ready to welcome him if he decides to come back,” Macron said, adding: “I‘m pretty sure that my friend President Trump will change his mind in the coming months or years.”

At Tuesday’s summit, Macron will urge wealthy nations to increase climate financing and urge investors to turn their backs on polluters in a bid to accelerate efforts to combat global warming.

French state-controlled utility EDF on Monday said it would invest 25 billion euros to develop 30 gigawatt of solar capacity in France between 2020 an 2035. Daily Newspaper Les Echos quoted the chief executive of Engie, Isabelle Kocher, as saying her company would invest 1 billion euros to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.

Separately, nine European energy companies including EDF, Italy’s Enel, Spain’s Iberdrola SA and Britain’s SSE said they would include green bonds in their financing policies.

Developing nations say that the rich are not on track with a broader commitment in the Paris accord for wealthy economies to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help developing countries switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

Oxfam estimated that there was only between $4 billion and $8 billion available for adaptation and that recent estimates showed the cost of helping emerging nations deal with rising sea levels, droughts, flooding and other effects of global warming could add up to $140 billion to $300 billion per year by 2030.

“Right now, the world’s poorest people are getting only a tiny fraction of the help they desperately need to survive,” Oxfam said in a statement.

The House version of a bill that would cut corporate tax rates calls for eliminating a tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasers of electric vehicles. Auto industry and environmental groups are lobbying to save the credit as the House and Senate move to merge their versions of the tax overhaul legislation.

Barra said eliminating the tax credit would affect the way potential electric vehicle buyers calculate the cost of owning one. “It changes the equation,” she told reporters at an event sponsored by the Automotive Press Association of Detroit.

“I‘m a proponent of that staying in” the tax code, Barra said. “That’s what we convey to the administration.”

The latest promising news came from China where banks doled out a surprisingly generous dose of credit in November, which could bode well for a pick up in retail sales and industrial output due later in the week.

There was no lasting market impact from an explosion in New York’s busy Port Authority commuter hub which New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described as an “attempted terrorist attack.”

Investors continued their policy vigil with the Federal Reserve set to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

The last time the spread was that plump was in 1999.

Yet the euro is currently up 12 percent on the dollar this year, while the dollar is down 8 percent on a basket of currencies .DXY - an indication interest rate differentials aren’t everything in forex.

On Tuesday, the euro was steady at $1.1768 EUR= having failed to clear resistance around $1.1812 overnight. The dollar was idling at 113.48 yen JPY=, just off a one-month top of 113.69.

Dealers at Citi noted interbank volumes in the forex market had been 35 percent below average overnight and another thin session was likely on Tuesday.

There was a little more action in bitcoin, which was last at $16,350 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP while its newly minted futures contract <0#XBT:> fell back to $17,800.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) will start offering customer services based out of the northern Chinese city of Ningxia in partnership with local firm Ningxia Western Cloud Data Technology Co Ltd (NWCD), the U.S. firm said.

“AWS has formed a strategic technology collaboration with NWCD, and NWCD operates and provides services from the AWS China Ningxia Region, in full compliance with Chinese regulations,” Amazon said in a statement.

The move comes a month after AWS said it will sell the hardware assets of its Beijing-registered cloud unit for up to 2 billion yuan ($302.06 million) to its partner Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd to comply with new regulations.

China launched strict new regulations in June that require foreign firms to store data locally and outsource hardware elements to local partners.

Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with domestic companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, opening dozens of new data centers in just the past year.

Chinese firms account for roughly 80 percent of total cloud services revenue in China, according to Synergy Research Group.

U.S. companies Amazon, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp must jump over hurdles to compete, facing new surveillance measures by China and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers.

Inicialmente, a intenção do Palácio do Planalto era começar o debate da matéria apenas na próxima segunda-feira, mas houve um acerto com o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), para antecipar esse calendário.

Pelo novo cronograma, a proposta será discutida a partir desta quinta, após uma nova rodada de conversas do governo com sua base. A votação da proposta deverá ocorrer a partir da terça-feira da próxima semana, o que deverá coincidir com o dia da apreciação em plenário do Orçamento de 2018.

Aliado de Temer, o presidente do Congresso, senador Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE), agendou a sessão conjunta das duas Casas para a terça da próxima semana, o que deve garantir quórum elevado no Legislativo.

O presidente Michel Temer deverá se envolver pessoalmente na busca de apoios da base em favor do texto. O Planalto está otimista com a conquista de votos nos últimos dias, mas quer ter um quadro mais individualizado sobre os apoios de cada um dos partidos da base, segundo uma fonte. A cautela se justifica, uma vez que tem havido divergência dos apoios que o governo tem entre as próprias lideranças da base.

Em entrevista coletiva na manhã desta segunda, o deputado Carlos Marun (PMDB-MS), que assumirá na quinta-feira a Secretaria de Governo, manteve o cálculo do governo de que faltam ainda de 40 a 50 votos para alcançar uma margem de segurança para aprovar o texto --que precisa do apoio de ao menos 308 dos 513 deputados. Um dos vice-líderes do governo na Câmara, Beto Mansur (PRB-SP), contudo, disse que há cerca de 100 indecisos na base.

Após PMDB e PTB fecharem questão em favor da proposta, o PPS seguiu a mesma linha no fim de semana. Num aceno a Temer, o novo presidente do PSDB, o governador Geraldo Alckmin, disse ser pessoalmente a favor do fechamento de questão e vai ouvir os deputados da bancada esta semana para tomar uma decisão.

Mansur, conhecido pelas estimativas de votos com base em tabelas, acredita que novas movimentações políticas do fim de semana podem ter ajudado o quadro do governo. Ele citou a decisão do PPS e a atuação de Alckmin em favor da reforma.

“Lógico que ele (Alckmin) vai trabalhar, espero que isso aconteça, de ele trabalhar junto à bancada do PSDB. Eu vou ter surpresa se o PSDB não for no mesmo caminho que o candidato deles à Presidência da República”, afirmou.

A avaliação no Planalto, segundo uma fonte, é que Alckmin tem cumprido bem o papel de apoio à reforma, o que pode gerar um bom humor no restante da base. A expectativa de governistas é que o PP também feche questão --o partido indicou que deve se posicionar dessa forma se o texto for à votação.

EMENDAS

Durante o dia, Temer reuniu-se com os ministros do Planejamento, Dyogo Oliveira, da Integração Nacional, Helder Barbalho, e das Cidades, Alexandre Baldy, além de dois representantes do alto escalão do Ministério da Saúde.

Segundo a fonte palaciana, foi discutida uma ação dos ministérios em favor da garantia de liberação de recursos de emendas parlamentares para este ano e para o próximo. Essa é uma das armas comumente usadas por governos para conquistar votos dos parlamentares.

Em Buenos Aires no domingo, o presidente disse que a reforma vai “muito bem” e destacou acreditar que é “possível” aprová-la neste ano na Câmara, embora tenha admitido que a matéria poderá ficar para 2018.

“Eu suponho que talvez seja possível (votar neste ano), mas se não for, nós vamos encerrar a discussão ainda neste ano e esta matéria da Previdência não vai parar. Se não for neste ano, será no início do ano que vem”, disse o presidente.

Marun foi na mesma linha e afirmou que “vamos tentar votar agora, vamos conseguir”, mas ressaltou que caso isso não ocorra “vamos chegar aqui em fevereiro e esse vai ser o assunto”. O deputado insistiu, porém, que o governo está em busca dos votos que faltam para que a matéria seja aprovada agora.

A leitura afinada de Temer e Marun, segundo uma fonte do Planalto, é que os parlamentares terão de conviver com a pauta da reforma, se ela não for aprovada. Isto é, em vez de o governo estar “jogando a toalha”, ele estará colocando uma pressão permanente nos deputados. Entretanto, para Mansur, o governo teria menos votos se deixar a apreciação da matéria para 2018.

“Não há como você ficar agora fazendo conjectura que não dá para votar agora, vai votar em fevereiro. Na minha opinião, nós teremos menos votos em fevereiro do que teremos na semana que vem”, disse Mansur a jornalistas, acrescentando que o foco do governo é trabalhar para angariar os votos necessários e votar a proposta na próxima semana.

Em São Paulo, também nesta manhã, o presidente da Câmara reconheceu que não será “fácil” votar a proposta na próxima semana, mas que segue empenhado para isso.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.29, or about 2 percent, at $64.69 a barrel.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled at $57.99 a barrel, 63 cents or 1 percent above their last settlement.

The difference between the two benchmarks WTCLc1-LCOc1 was the greatest since late October, as Brent rallied after the shutdown of the pipeline that carries the biggest of the five North Sea crude oil streams that underpin the benchmark.

The pipeline, which can carry 450,000 barrels per day of Forties crude from the North Sea to the Kinneil processing terminal in Scotland, has been operating at reduced capacity for about four days before the shutdown.

“It is a supply concern not only because the pipeline transports a significant portion of North Sea crude oil output, but also because it may take weeks before the issue is resolved,” said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

The market had expected the pipeline to return to service quickly and was surprised by the extended shutdown, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

“It’s a significant amount of crude oil in a market that has been the tightest for crude oil,” Kilduff said.

Earlier in the session, both benchmarks popped higher after an explosion rocked New York’s Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the city’s busiest commuter hubs.

Investors tend to head for hard-asset commodity markets like gold and silver during high-risk events, and oil can also attract investment, Kilduff said.

Brent and WTI have gained well over a third from 2017 lows, drawing support from a cut in production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers, including Russia, which has been in place since the start of the year.

During the weekend, Kuwait’s oil minister suggested that an exit from the supply-cut agreement would be studied before June.

The United Arab Emirates energy minister said on Monday that OPEC plans to announce in June an exit strategy from the cuts, though he added it did not mean the pact would end by then.

Gains from the cuts could also be undermined by rising output from the United States, which is not participating in the deal to withhold production.

The number of rigs drilling for new oil in the United States last week rose by two to 751, the highest since September, energy services company Baker Hughes said on Friday.

“The largest concern for investors currently remains the rise in the U.S. rig count,” said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers.

A higher rig count points to a further rise in U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which is already up more than 15 percent since mid-2016 at 9.71 million barrels per day. That is the highest since the early 1970s, and close to the output levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.","Oil gains on Forties Pipeline shutdown, New York blast",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-gains-on-forties-pipeline-shutdown-new-york-blast-idINKBN1E509X?il=0

Delegates of the 164-member body were instead discussing an “interim” deal, but remained divided on whether such a temporary agreement should contain exemptions for certain countries while negotiations for a final deal went ahead, Rockwell said.

“It seems clear that we may not be able to get a final decision, so an interim decision on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is being discussed, it’s on the cards,” he said.

The United States and 12 other countries said last year they would begin WTO negotiations to ban harmful fishery subsidies, which they said contributed to over fishing and over capacity in the sector or were linked to illegal fishing.

The success of any deal is widely seen to rest on the willingness of China, which has resisted pressure to curb its vast fleet, to accept restrictions. China presented a plan last month to ban subsidies to IUU fishing vessels, but with exemptions for developing countries and areas subject to territorial disputes.

E’ il quadro che emerge dal primo rapporto annuale Istat sul mercato del lavoro.

Nel primo semestre 2017 in Italia gli occupati erano circa 23 milioni, cifra vicina ai livelli pre crisi del 2008, sebbene in termini di ore lavorate per addetto il gap resti rilevante.

La crescita è basata prevalentemente sui contratti a tempo determinato (che nel 2017 hanno toccato i massimi dal 1992 a 2,7 milioni di persone), e nei settori agricoltura e servizi.

Il lavoro a tempo indeterminato è cresciuto in particolare nel 2015-2016 grazie alla decontribuzione per le assunzioni, per poi rallentare, anche se nel secondo trimestre 2017 è arrivato vicino ai massimi storici, con 14,966 milioni di lavoratori.

Impennata per i contratti brevissimi. Nel 2016, le persone con rapporti di lavoro di breve durata sono state circa 4 milioni, dai 3 milioni del 2012. Parallelamente sono aumentati i committenti, che dal 2015 superano il milione.

Il valore economico dei lavori brevi (misurato sulle retribuzioni e i redditi imponibili) è salito dai 9,7 miliardi nel 2012 ai 12 miliardi nel 2016.

Il 44% dei lavoratori che tra il 2012 e il 2015 era impegnato in lavori brevi, nel 2016 transita verso forme di lavoro più strutturate.

“E’ preoccupante che aumentino i contratti con durata inferiore ai tre mesi. Dovremmo valutare se non sia il caso di rivedere la normativa che consente fino a cinque rinnovi”, ha commentato il presidente Inps, Tito Boeri, nel corso della presentazione.

Il ministro del Lavoro, Giuliano Poletti, si è limitato ad osservare che una riflessione è giusta, negando però un automatismo tra il numero di rinnovi possibile e la crescita dei contratti a termine.

I contratti a tempo possono essere rinnovati per cinque volte fino a un massimo di 36 mesi.

In declino il lavoro indipendente (-430.000 posti nel periodo 2008-2016) e quello nella pubblica amministrazione (-220.000 unità), a causa del lungo blocco del turn over.

Ma per Boeri non è un fenomeno negativo perché “molti rapporti sono diventati alle dipendenze mentre prima lo erano in modo mascherato”.

Male anche i giovani. Nel periodo 2008-2016 il tasso di occupazione in Italia per i 15-34enni è diminuito di 10,4 punti rispetto al 2008, a fronte di un aumento di 16 punti per i 55-64enni e di 1,5 punti per i 65-69enni.

O Ibovespa fechou com variação positiva de 0,09 por cento, a 72.800 pontos. Na máxima da sessão, o índice subiu 0,86 por cento, enquanto recuou 0,32 por cento na mínima.

O giro financeiro somou 6,88 bilhões de reais, abaixo da média diária para dezembro até sexta-feira de 8,35 bilhões de reais. No mês passado, a média diária foi de 10,33 bilhões de reais.

Maia (DEM-RJ) disse que “não é fácil” votar a reforma da Previdência na semana que vem e afirmou que só pautará a proposta caso existam garantias “muito claras” de que ela será aprovada pelos deputados.

As declarações vieram após uma abertura mais favorável da bolsa, diante do noticiário do fim de semana mais positivo sobre as negociações da reforma da Previdência.

“A gente tinha um viés mais positivo e ele fez esses comentários que não foram muito bem recebidos”, disse o analista da Um Investimentos Aldo Moniz. “A gente está vivendo a situação em que uns dizem que vai ter a votação e outros dizem que não e isso atrapalha uma tomada de decisão”, completou.

No fim de semana, o governador de São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, foi confirmado como presidente do PSDB e disse ser a favor de o partido fechar questão sobre a reforma.

A postura de Alckmin trouxe ventos mais favoráveis ao governo do presidente Michel Temer, que também anunciou que o deputado Carlos Marun (PMDB-MS) vai assumir o lugar do tucano Antônio Imbassahy na Secretaria de Governo da Presidência da República, em medida que pode ajudar nas negociações para aumentar o apoio à reforma.

Rurik Jutting, who is in his early 30s, a former Bank of America employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in 2014 on grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders.

The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the financial hub.

The jury unanimously found him guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in the former British colony in November last year.

Jutting’s lawyer, Michael Vidler, said the grounds for appeal would focus on the “directions given by the deputy judge to the jury”.

Jutting is expected to appear in court.

In strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial, Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known.

He described Jutting as the “archetypal sexual predator” who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that the possibility he would murder again if freed would be very likely.

It took the jury, made up of four women and five men, about six hours, including a lunch break, to reach its decision.

Lawyers for Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism had impaired his ability to control his behaviour.

The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgements and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies.",British banker to appeal against life sentence for Hong Kong double murder,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-murder/british-banker-to-appeal-against-life-sentence-for-hong-kong-double-murder-idUKKBN1E52ST

The higher inflation rate is unlikely to push the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to change its key rate any time soon, economists in the poll said.

In the poll of more than 30 economists, annual consumer inflation, due to be released on Dec. 12 at 1200 GMT, was seen surging to a 13-month high of 4.20 percent in November from October’s 3.58 percent.

The higher inflation rate is unlikely to push the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to change its key rate any time soon, economists in the poll said.

November’s heavy rains “created lots of damage” for perishable fruit and vegetable crops, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at Larsen & Toubro. “We have seen that translated into price rises for onions, tomatoes and other perishable commodities”.

Increased house rent allowances for government employees and rising crude oil prices added to inflationary pressures alongside higher raw material costs due to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, she said.

Wholesale prices are expected to have risen 3.78 percent last month from a year earlier, compared to a 3.59 percent rise in October.

NEUTRAL STANCE

At its Dec. 6 policy meeting, the central bank raised its inflation projection by 10 basis points to between 4.3 and 4.7 percent for the six months ending in March. It kept interest rates steady and stressed a neutral policy stance.

The RBI cut rates by 200 basis points from January 2015 until August this year while food and energy prices were down. It is likely to keep them unchanged through the end of 2018, according to a separate Reuters poll.

“Interest rates will remain stable for some time before they (the RBI) start hiking them because industrial growth is still weak,” Nitsure said. “Recovery is happening in a few sectors but it has not spread to all sectors and private investment sentiment also remains low.”

Industrial output growth eased to 3.0 percent in October from September’s 3.8 percent, as demand continued to suffer from disruption caused by the new national sales tax as well as last year’s currency clampdown that wiped out over 85 percent of the cash in circulation.

But halting a five-quarter slide, India’s economic growth rebounded in the three months ending in September with businesses starting to overcome troubles from implementation of the new tax.

“We still have some output gap but it’s not as bad as it used to be a couple of quarters back. It will not make any sense for the RBI to just react to the (inflation) number. They also have to look at other factors,” said Arun Singh, lead economist at Dun & Bradstreet India in Mumbai.

Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining center.","MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria and ordered “a significant part” of Moscow’s military contingent there to start withdrawing on Monday, declaring their work largely done.

Putin, who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March, made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia’s Hmeymim air base in Syria - his first since Russia intervened in the conflict. He held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces.

The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting his Egyptian and Turkish counterparts, Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given him to cast himself as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force.

The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad’s favor. Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal.

“In just over two years, Russia’s armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists,” Putin told Russian servicemen.

A “significant part” of the Russian force could now return home. “The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created,” said Putin. “The Motherland awaits you.”

Washington was skeptical about Putin’s statement.

“Russian comments about removal of their forces do not often correspond with actual troop reductions, and do not affect U.S. priorities in Syria,” said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon.

Putin made clear in any case that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback.

Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia’s help, saying the blood of Moscow’s “martyrs” had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army. It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past.

Russia’s main contribution has been air strikes, and with Iran-backed Shi’ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground, the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation.

Russia’s campaign, which has been extensively covered on state TV at home, has not caught the imagination of most Russians. But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention.

The use of private military contractors, something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defense ministry, has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low.

Officially, less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign, but the real number, including private contractors, is estimated to be much higher.

ELECTORAL BOOST?

Russia’s “mission accomplished” moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters.

Though polls show he will easily win, they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics, and Putin’s supporters are keen to get him re-elected on a big turnout, which in their eyes confers legitimacy.

Putin, who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia’s political landscape for the last 17 years, told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors.

Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags, Putin said his military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a “sovereign independent state.”

“I congratulate you!” Putin told the servicemen.

Putin is keen to organize a special event in Russia - the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution.

When asked about Putin’s announcement, Yahya Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Geneva, said it welcomed any step that brought Syria closer to real peace.

Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces, its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback.

Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria’s Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous “on a permanent basis,” said Putin.

Both bases are protected by sophisticated air defense missile systems.

Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining center.

However, Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities.

“We’ve seen such announcements before, which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared,” said one European diplomat who declined to be named.

“The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva (peace talks). Absent that, the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation.”","Putin, in Syria, says mission accomplished, orders partial Russian pull-out",https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-russia-putin/putin-in-syria-says-mission-accomplished-orders-partial-russian-pull-out-idINKBN1E50WH

Volume was roughly $50 million, Breakingviews calculates, less than 0.5 percent of actual bitcoin trading in the prior 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Futures have real-world value, for example allowing producers or consumers of a commodity to insure themselves against price movements, or helping investors to hedge their positions. In the bitcoin world, there are so-called miners with investments in processing power and hefty costs like electricity who could use the contracts this way, but that’s about it. And with bitcoin soaring more than 15-fold in 2017 to well over $16,000 early on Monday, selling bitcoin futures short is likely to be prohibitively expensive.

Most market players will be cautious until the contracts settle down. There are, though, other reasons for concern. Bitcoin futures aren’t perfect proxies for the real thing, partly because they will be settled in dollars not the crypto-currency, which trades at different dollar prices in different places. CBOE settlements, for example, will be based on bitcoin’s value on the Gemini Exchange, established by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame.

CME’s futures, launching next weekend, will settle at a reference price drawn from multiple exchanges. One opportunity could be arbitrage, exploiting the pricing discrepancies. But it will take time for any patterns to emerge.

Proponents reckon the entry of two big, regulated U.S. exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring bitcoin exposure to retail investors.

Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearing houses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges – and their customers – can now ride the bitcoin bandwagon without touching the crypto-currency at all.",Breakingviews - Bitcoin futures set scene for more gambling,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-futures-breakingviews/breakingviews-bitcoin-futures-set-scene-for-more-gambling-idUSKBN1E51LF

Karime Macias is the wife of former ruling party Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte, who is awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement and organized crime, in a case that public auditors said was the worst they had ever seen in Mexico.

In the letter, which the news site posted online, Macias said she was forced to leave the country and shelter in the UK because of “persecution” at home.

Reuters did not obtain the letter and could not verify its authenticity. Macias’ lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. Macias has not been charged with any crime.

Neither the attorney general’s office nor the Veracruz government responded to requests for comment.

Macias confirmed in the letter that diaries in which she had reportedly written “I deserve abundance” repeatedly were hers, and said that her phrases were of a spiritual nature.

Macias said she wanted back personal items including paintings, luxury pens, golf clubs and books that she said were seized by prosecutors without a warrant, adding that she feared other items found were planted there.

In April, Duarte was arrested in a Guatemala hotel where he had been with his wife after fleeing the country. He has denied any wrongdoing, and Macias was not detained.

Top Mexican auditor ASF said in 2016 that the irregularities in public funds under Duarte were the highest amount it had ever seen.

Prosecutors say Duarte headed an organization consisting of at least nine other people, whose criminal operations were carried out in Veracruz, the eastern Gulf state of Campeche and Mexico City between 2011 and 2016.

At a hearing in July, a judge gave prosecutors six months to proceed with the investigation against Duarte.

China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.

Numerous Chinese fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft conducted “routine” and “planned” distant sea patrols on Monday to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke said on the military branch’s microblog.

H-6K bombers, Su-30 and J-11 fighter jets, and surveillance, alert and refueling aircraft flew over the Miyako Strait in Japan’s south and the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines to “test real combat capabilities”, Shen said.

Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan said in a statement they had dispatched aircraft and ships to monitor the activity of the Chinese military and that the drills were not unusual and people should not be alarmed.

China has conducted numerous similar patrols near Taiwan this year, saying such practices have been normalized as it presses ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores.

Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. Taiwan is well armed, mostly with U.S. weaponry, but has been pressing Washington to sell it more high-tech equipment to better deter China.

In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.

That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would invade Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited Taiwan.

While both Seoul and Beijing share the goal of getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two neighbors have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.

China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tensions with North Korea.

At his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this year on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea’s agreement with China in late October the two would normalize all exchanges and move past the year-long spat over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two.

The THAAD dispute had dented South Korea’s economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were canceled.

While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea’s decision to deploy it.

In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD’s presence is inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.

“South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China’s security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,” Moon said.

Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have “good results” if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, he added.

Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have “friendly cooperation” with China, and that China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula.

In its latest missile provocation, Pyongyang test-launched what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it continues its mission to create a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the United States.

During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses partaking in the four-day visit.

The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on “energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.”

Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F) this century, surpassing a “tipping point” that a global climate deal aims to avert.

Exxon’s statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company’s board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon’s long-term outlook.

Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state’s comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday’s decision “a win for shareholders and for the company’s ability to manage risk.”

However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company’s statement. “This is giving no detail,” said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring’s resolution. He said Exxon’s statement “needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they’re responsive to last year’s request.”

An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing.

Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon’s May annual meeting.

Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks.

Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts.

BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon.

The report will carry weight beyond the company’s next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.

The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees’ Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday.

Malinowski’s agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with “climate-competent” perspectives.",Exxon to provide details on climate-change impact to its business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-climate/exxon-to-provide-details-on-climate-change-impact-to-its-business-idUSKBN1E602L

One neighbour in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Windsor Terrace said she had not seen him in months but described his home as quiet and observant in Islamic customs. She saw no evidence of extremism.

“They’re really nice people. This is shocking,” said the neighbour, Arlene Jograj, a teacher who had greeted Ullah in passing. “We all know each other. We have block parties. I’ve been over there for dinner parties after Ramadan. We’re a really tight-knit street,” she said.

Ullah came from the southeastern Bangladeshi district of Chittagong and last visited the country on Sept. 8, Inspector General of Police A K M Shahidul Hoque told Reuters on Monday.

He had no criminal record in Bangladesh, Hoque said.

Several U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no information indicating Ullah was previously known to any U.S. spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militant groups. But that does not rule out the possibility some connection could be found.

Ullah arrived in the United States seven years ago on a family visa, one authoritative U.S. source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

U.S. investigators believe he was self-radicalized after entering the United States, most likely by watching militant propaganda on the internet, the officials said, adding that they were unaware of any specific militant video that might have led him to produce his faulty explosive device.

From March 2012 through March 2015, he held a license to drive a limousine or black cab as an independent contractor, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission said in a statement.

New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo called the suspect a “lone wolf,” similar to the suspect in the most recent attack in New York, when an Uzbek immigrant driving a rented truck ran over people on a bicycle path on Oct. 31, killing eight.

Each acted alone, inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State, Cuomo said.

“Both of them went on the web, downloaded information,” Cuomo said of the two suspects, adding that Ullah learned to make a bomb online.

“They’re not people who come from overseas. They live here. They’re disgruntled,” said Cuomo, who went to the scene of the crime where he met with investigators.

Ullah was influenced by violent Islamist extremists and was “angry,” Cuomo said. This could have been for any number of reasons, whether because of U.S. policy abroad or his lot in life at home, he said.

New York police shut down an entire block of row houses in Windsor Terrace, deploying a large show of force with at least one helicopter flying overhead. It was not clear if the neighbourhood was Ullah’s most recent address.

Neighbours called it a diverse, family-oriented neighbourhood of longstanding white families of Italian and Polish descent with more recent Chinese, Indian and Bangladeshi arrivals

“This is a great neighbourhood. It’s very family oriented, very safe,” Jorgraj said. “This doesn’t change my opinion of the neighbourhood at all. This is just the state of the world we live in now.”",New York blast suspect went from limo driver to accused subway bomber,https://in.reuters.com/article/newyork-incident-suspect/new-york-blast-suspect-went-from-limo-driver-to-accused-subway-bomber-idINKBN1E52QF

Shares in Steinhoff fell by 80 percent last week after the international retail group, whose brands include Poundland and Mattress Firm, disclosed “accounting irregularities” and parted ways with veteran chief executive Markus Jooste.

The JSE said in a statement it was investigating whether there had been any breaches of its listing requirements, adding this included “any breaches in relation to previous financial disclosures made to the public by Steinhoff International”.

Steinhoff (SNHJ.J) has a secondary listing on the bourse, which is also reviewing trading in its shares ahead of last week’s announcements, which included the company delaying its earnings report.

Two days before Steinhoff’s initial announcement, trading volumes in its shares jumped to between 27 and 32 million. This was the highest since Sept. 22 when the company said it expected a Dutch court to throw out a petition by its former joint venture partner to order a probe into the company’s accounts.

SHARE BOUNCE

Steinhoff’s shares rose by as much as 40 percent on Monday, regaining some ground after it called on its lenders to help.

It has also hired U.S. investment bank Moelis & Co (MC.N) and asked management consultancy AlixPartners “to assist on liquidity management and operational measures”.

“The group is asking for and requires continued support in relation to existing facilities from all its lenders to achieve an immediate stabilisation of the group’s financing,” it said.

The company has delayed its regular annual lenders’ meeting in London by a week to Dec. 19.

By 1313 GMT, the stock (SNHJ.J) was up 38 percent at 8.30 in Johannesburg, recouping around $700 million of the $14 billion of shareholder value wiped off since last Wednesday.

Steinhoff has its main listing in Frankfurt where its shares rose by more than 13 percent.

There was some buying off a low base, but most investors were waiting for more information, Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods said.

“On the positive side, it does look like Christo Wiese is doing a salvage job,” Woods said of the retail group’s biggest shareholder and chairman, who is now at the helm.

Wiese and former chief executive Jooste were instrumental in turning Steinhoff from a modest distributor of furniture made in communist era eastern Europe to a global household goods juggernaut, vying for market share with the likes of IKEA.

Steinhoff has been on shopping spree since 2011 when it took over French furniture retailer Conforama. Last year’s string of acquisitions thrust it firmly on to investors’ radar screens.

Separately, Anglo-South African investment bank and asset manager Investec (INVP.L) (INLJ.J) said its credit exposure to Steinhoff represented a small portion of its balance sheet.

Investec said it had derivative exposures linked to the Steinhoff share price, where a trading loss could materialize.

The loss maximum potential loss could be approximately 3 percent of the Investec group’s post-tax operating profit, although it could be as low as zero.",South African exchange investigates Steinhoff disclosures,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1E50KQ-OZABS

Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC.

The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.

Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended.

“When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”

The assets in question would have expanded Comcast’s international footprint through ownership of Sky and Star. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages.

Disney’s negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment.

Any potential deal will follow the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision last month to sue to block AT&T Inc’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc.

The conglomerate is laying off 12,000 people in a power division that lights up 30 percent of the world. It blamed overcapacity amid a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. But other divisions are closely tied to fossil fuels, too. Its troubles suggest a wider shakeout is in the offing.

The company’s power division makes turbines for electricity-generating plants around the world. Most of those plants have traditionally been driven by coal and natural gas, along with nuclear, but alternatives are coming on fast. The International Energy Agency predicts renewables will account for 40 percent of global power generation by 2040, up from 24 percent in 2016. Coal’s market share is projected to shrink significantly.

Other GE businesses are tied to fossil fuels in one way or another. Revenue at the company’s transportation business, which makes diesel-powered locomotives, fell 14 percent in the third quarter from the same period last year.

New Chief Executive John Flannery said at an investor presentation last month that the company may sell this group, in part because of secular declines in U.S. coal shipments by rail. He has also formed a committee to review the company’s 62.5 percent stake in Baker Hughes, an oil and gas servicing company that is directly tied to growth in drilling business. In aggregate, with the power division, these three groups generated nearly half the group’s revenue in the third quarter.

GE is starting to switch its business mix in the right direction. It has a renewable energy group that was bolstered by its acquisition of Alstom in 2015. Meanwhile, the cuts announced Thursday will save $1 billion a year in expenses.

Competitor Siemens, which announced a smaller round of power layoffs last month, may have encouraged GE to scale down. Others should take note of the shifts in the global energy market too. Fossil fuels appear to be starting to power down for the long term.

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.

The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP.

Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.

Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.

“The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”

Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.

Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.

The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.

VOLATILITY CONCERNS

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

Morneau told reporters that for an initial two years, 75 percent of the money would go to the provinces and 25 percent to Ottawa.

Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau plans to allow recreational marijuana nationwide by July 2018, which will make Canada the first Group of Seven country to do so.

Trudeau says legalization is needed to keep the drug out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.

The federal government had initially suggested a 50-50 revenue split, an idea the provinces rejected on the grounds it was not enough to help cover the extra costs of enforcing the new rules once they take effect.

Morneau said he and his provincial counterparts also agreed to stick to Ottawa’s proposal for a tax on all cannabis products of C$1 (78 cents) per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher.

“Our expectation is that by keeping prices low, we will be able to get rid of the black market. However, that will happen over time,” said Morneau.

The responsibility for setting up networks of stores to actually sell the drug lies with the provinces, who along with some police officials have complained Ottawa is moving too fast toward legalization and not taking extra costs into account.

Morneau said the additional tax revenue would allow the provinces to help meet the costs of municipalities dealing with the pot trade on a daily basis.

He estimated the tax would raise around C$400 million a year for the first two years, at which point Ottawa and the provinces will meet to reassess the initiative.

The federal take will be capped at C$100 million a year, with any revenues exceeding that amount going to the provinces. The finance minister of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said he was very pleased by that part of the deal.

“If there is a surge in the marketplace, we can accommodate it more effectively,” said Charles Sousa.

The Nazis and fascists were fighting for the forces of General Francisco Franco, in revolt against the elected republican government of Spain, flouting a non-intervention agreement with impunity and helping to bring Spain’s future dictator to victory.

When on trial in Nuremberg after the war, Hermann Goering, chief of the German Air Force, testified that “the Spanish Civil War gave me an opportunity to put my young air force to the test, and a means for my men to gain experience.”

It’s not clear, even now, what Goering (and Benito Mussolini’s) young men were getting experience in; it certainly wasn’t precision bombing. The strategic targets were the bridge and an arms factory. Neither were damaged – nor was the Tree of Guernica, an oak, the original of which was planted in the 14th century, under which the lords of the Basque country swore to uphold freedom for the people. But the 1937 attack killed at least 200 inhabitants (the exact figure is still disputed) and wounded hundreds more. The town, a center of Basque cultural life, was largely destroyed.

There’s a majority view that the attack was a practice exercise for blitzkrieg, the “lightning war” of terror from the air much used by the Luftwaffe to demoralize civilian populations in World War Two. Wolfgang Schmidt, an expert on the air force at the Military History Research Institute in Potsdam, says that ”for the German air force, Guernica was a trial run on how one can spread horror and distress through attacks on cities and towns.”

Guernica stands out from other victims of fascism because Pablo Picasso, born in Spain but living much of his life in France, commemorated it in painting. He set to work immediately after the attack, completing the huge, almost 26-foot wide canvas by June, using only black, white and gray, as if to give it the image of objectivity. His choice of palette was inspired not just to record the horror of the event, but by a piece of reporting, done from the town on the night of the attack, when the flames were still leaping in the streets.

George Steer, a young South African-born journalist, had come to the Basque country to report on the Spanish civil war for The Times of London – this after reporting in 1935 on the brutal Italian invasion of Ethiopia, in which poison gas was extensively used and clearly-marked ambulances bombed from the air. Among the first to arrive in Guernica after the raid, his dispatch from the devastated town relied on the testimony of the survivors.

“The whole town of 7,000 inhabitants, plus 3,000 refugees, was slowly and systematically pounded to pieces,” wrote Steer. “Over a radius of five miles round, a detail of the raiders’ technique was to bomb separate caserios, or farmhouses. In the night these burned like little candles in the hills. All the villages around were bombed with the same intensity as the town itself, and at Mugica, a little group of houses at the head of the Guernica inlet, the population was machine-gunned for 15 minutes.”

The report, at the same time elegant and urgent, with horror conveyed not by hyperbole but through detail, was reproduced round the world – including in Parisian newspapers, where Picasso read it. He then produced, in the monochrome of a newspaper article, a painting which from then until now has lasted as a statement of the brute amorality of fascism.

A few days after Steer, when the fires had become embers, Franco’s nationalists entered the town. With them came the spin-doctors of the day. They ensured that telltale German and Italian shell fragments and bullet cases were removed, and empty oil drums placed about the town. When journalists friendly to Franco were brought in, they were told that the Basques had destroyed their own town by setting it alight – hence the empty oil drums. As Paul Preston writes in his book, “We Saw Spain Die,” most of the reporters followed the lead, and the lie was sent around the world – but in this case, after the truth had already been reported.

The nationalists’ efforts to blame the victims, flimsy (and disgusting) as it was, was believed because those who swallowed it wished to believe it. It exonerated those who perpetrated the attack and confirmed the view of Franco’s supporters that his and their enemies were evil. It’s worth exhuming the brave reporting of those like Steer, for it shows that fake news often originates from those who accuse their enemies of producing it.

This is something Donald Trump now does routinely. The president’s obsession has become so habitual that we are in danger of becoming accustomed to it, and thus ignoring its danger. Those who support him go to extraordinary lengths to show that his enemies, not he or they, are liars. Two weeks ago, a woman, employed by Project Veritas – a conservative group that names itself after the Latin word for “truth” and uses undercover methods to expose what it says is liberal bias in the media – tried to pass herself off to the Washington Post as a victim of Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican running for Senate in a special election on Dec. 12. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls – a charge he denies. The aim was to have the Post report her story, then smear the Post by revealing it as fake.

There’s no suggestion that Trump knew anything of this (or that he’s in General Franco’s league). But Trump doesn’t have to be. He has created a framework in which the quotidian nature of press life is inverted. By calling accurate reporting fake, he elevates fake reporting to the level of truth – however it’s arrived at. Fake news is that which he wants to be believed – and which his supporters wish to believe.

The George Steer school of reporting – seeing with one’s own eyes, asking with one’s own voice, assembling the story with one’s own judgment, governed by a desire for accuracy – is, fortunately, both alive and careful, as the Post’s rejection of the fake harassment story shows. It is that reporting which should be sought out – there’s plenty of it – and relied on. But the commander-in-chief of fakery remains in place, still occupying the bully pulpit, still with millions of followers who wish to believe him.","Commentary: From Guernica’s ruins, a lesson in fake news",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-guernica-commentary/commentary-from-guernicas-ruins-a-lesson-in-fake-news-idUKKBN1E136O

The company, which owns and operates 35 shopping centres in the United States and United Kingdom valued at $32 billion, said it was in talks with unnamed parties for a “potentially significant corporate transaction”, without revealing further information.

Chairman Frank Lowy would host a media conference in Sydney at 0700 GMT.

Analysts said it was rare for Westfield to seek a trading halt simply to announce a sale of a stake in a mall, suggesting a bigger deal was in the offing.

“They could be selling some of the lower grade assets - called their regional assets,” said Morningstar analyst Tony Sherlock, questioning whether that would be big enough to warrant a trading halt.

The company has stakes in 18 regional shopping centres, three of which it wholly owns.

Its flagship malls include Westfield London and Century City in Los Angeles, where it is completing a $1 billion overhaul.

Sherlock and another analyst, who declined to be named, played down speculation in one Australian newspaper that European property group Unibail Rodamco might be eyeing a takeover of Westfield.

They also said it was unlikely that Westfield might be looking to trump a $14.8 billion bid by Brookfield Property Partners LP for GGP Inc, one of the largest owners and operators of U.S. shopping centres.

India is strongly opposed to an economic corridor that China is building in Pakistan that runs through disputed Kashmir as part of the Belt and Road initiative.

India was the only country that stayed away from a May summit hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping to promote the plan to build railways, ports and power grids in a modern-day recreation of the Silk Road.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said New Delhi should not let political problems deter it from joining the project, involving billions of dollars of investment, and benefiting from it.

Lavrov was speaking in the Indian capital after a three-way meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj at which, he said, India’s reservations over the Chinese project were discussed.

“I know India has problems, we discussed it today, with the concept of One Belt and One Road, but the specific problem in this regard should not make everything else conditional to resolving political issues,” he said.

Russia, all the countries in central Asia, and European nations had signed up to the Chinese project to boost economic cooperation, he said.

“Those are the facts,” he said. “India, I am 100 percent convinced, has enough very smart diplomats and politicians to find a way which would allow you to benefit from this process.”

The comments by Russia, India’s former Cold War ally, reflected the differences within the trilateral grouping formed 15 years ago to challenge U.S.-led dominance of global affairs.

But substantial differences between India and China, mainly over long-standing border disputes, have snuffed out prospects of any real cooperation among the three.

India, in addition, has drawn closer to the United States in recent years, buying weapons worth billions of dollars to replace its largely Soviet-origin military.

“When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”

The suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, was taken to a hospital after suffering burns from the explosive device, which was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties and did not fully ignite, officials said. Investigators told Reuters they believe the attack in midtown Manhattan was intended to be a suicide bombing.

The blast, which occurred around 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) in a busy underground passageway between the subway station underneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square subway station, sent commuters fleeing for the exits and police officers rushing to the scene, as officials scrambled to reroute trains and shut down streets.

Three people, including a police officer, suffered minor injuries.

The attack came just six weeks after police say an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians along a bike path in lower Manhattan, killing eight in an act for which Islamic State later claimed responsibility. In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood.

In recent years, numerous people claiming to be inspired by Islamic State have carried out attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States.

A law enforcement official familiar with the Ullah investigation said investigators have found evidence that he watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet.

‘AMATEUR-LEVEL’

The weapon used in Monday’s attack was “amateur-level,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference near the explosion site. He told CNN the homemade bomb may not have fully ignited, possibly limiting the damage.

Officials said the attempted bombing underscored New York City’s status as a target for such attacks, citing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people in all, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.

“Let’s be clear, as New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. “And let’s also be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack.”

In a statement, President Donald Trump said the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.

“America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,” he said.

The president also criticized the visa program that allowed Ullah to enter the United States in 2011 because he had family members already in the country, saying such family visas are “incompatible with national security.”

Ullah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, said Shameem Ahsan, consul general of Bangladesh in New York.

Authorities did not immediately comment on Ullah’s motives. When asked whether Ullah had claimed any connection to Islamic State, New York Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said, “He did make statements but we’re not going to talk about that right now.”

Several U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no immediate information indicating Ullah was previously known to any American spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militants or terrorism, though a connection could still be found.

Ullah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country’s police chief. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.

Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver’s license from 2012 to 2015, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.

Monday’s incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in a long tunnel that connects sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso.

‘EVERYBODY WAS SCARED’

The explosion turned a normal start to the work week into a chaotic scene.

“There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,” said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. “Everybody was scared and running and shouting.”

The bus terminal was temporarily closed, and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway travel was disrupted but later returned to normal.

In December, New York experiences a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store window displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows.

More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city’s busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Ten train lines stop at the station.

The bus terminal is the busiest in the United States, according to the Port Authority. On a typical weekday, about 220,000 passengers arrive or depart on more than 7,000 buses.

The bus terminal is adjacent to and above the subway station’s western section. A long, narrow underground tunnel connects that part of the station to its eastern section, and is used by thousands of commuters during rush hour.

The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening stock markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries.

Technology and energy stocks closed higher Monday, helping Wall Street shake off uncertainties following the explosion.","Subway bomber wounds self, three victims in New York",https://www.reuters.com/article/newyork-incident/subway-bomber-wounds-self-three-victims-in-new-york-idINKBN1E51EK

While both Seoul and Beijing share the goal of getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two neighbors have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.

China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tensions with North Korea.

At his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this year on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea’s agreement with China in late October the two would normalize all exchanges and move past the year-long spat over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two.

The THAAD dispute had dented South Korea’s economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were canceled.

While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea’s decision to deploy it.

In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD’s presence is inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.

“South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China’s security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,” Moon said.

Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have “good results” if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, he added.

Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have “friendly cooperation” with China, and that China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula.

In its latest missile provocation, Pyongyang test-launched what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it continues its mission to create a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the United States.

During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses partaking in the four-day visit.

Treasury said the tax plan would more than pay for itself in 10 years, basing its forecast on a 2.9 percent annual economic growth assumption, a level well above most economists’ expectations, as well other changes on which the White House has made little progress.

“We are pleased to release an analysis demonstrating the revenue impact of the administration’s economic agenda,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker, said in a statement.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a conservative fiscal watchdog in Washington, said the Mnuchin analysis “makes a mockery of dynamic scoring and analysis,” referring to methods for forecasting the impact of tax changes on the economy.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Treasury analysis was “nothing more than one page of fake math.”

“It’s clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,” he said in a statement.

The sparring over economic forecasts came as Republicans resumed efforts to reconcile two tax-overhaul bills, one approved by the Senate and one by the House of Representatives.

President Donald Trump wants a single tax bill on his desk soon so he can sign it into law before the end of the year, in what would be his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January.

The Republican president will deliver a speech on Wednesday “to the American people on how tax reform will lead to a brighter future for them and their families,” the White House said in a statement.

Republicans are driving toward approval of a debt-financed package of deep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy and a mixed bag of results for middle-class Americans.

Although the Republicans see the effort as crucial to their prospects in November 2018’s congressional elections, nearly half of Americans oppose the plan, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.

DIFFERING PROJECTIONS

The Treasury analysis was meant to help bolster long-standing promises from Republicans, including Mnuchin, that their proposed tax cuts would super-charge an already growing economy and raise more than enough new tax revenue to offset a large federal deficit increase.

Congressional researchers have estimated the Republican plan would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years, before any projected positive effects on the economy, or $1 trillion after such effects.

In its analysis, Treasury said its projected 2.9 percent annual growth over the next decade would result not only from tax cuts but “a combination of regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and welfare reform as proposed in the administration’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget.”

The Trump administration sent a budget to Congress earlier this year that lawmakers largely ignored. While the White House has rolled back some regulations, it has made no substantial progress on infrastructure development or welfare changes.

Growth of 2.9 percent would produce $1.8 trillion in new tax revenues over 10 years, more than enough to offset the revenue that the tax plan would lose, the department said.

“We acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,” it added in a statement accompanying its analysis, which focused on the tax plan as approved more than three weeks ago by the Senate Finance Committee.

The full Senate on Dec. 2 approved a somewhat different plan, which would boost gross domestic product by 0.7 percent in 2018 and have little effect on GDP in the decade ahead, said the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, in a report on Monday.

Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania also issued a report on Monday finding the plan approved by the full Senate would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, “even with assumptions favorable to economic growth.”",U.S. Treasury tax study slammed as 'fake math' by Democrats,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/u-s-treasury-tax-study-slammed-as-fake-math-by-democrats-idUKKBN1E52MB

Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water,” a magical drama about a relationship between a strange river creature and a mute cleaner, collected a leading seven nods, including best drama, and director and acting nominations for Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins.

“Above all, ‘The Shape of Water’ is about love overcoming fear and embracing the Other,” Del Toro said in a statement.

“The Post,” Steven Spielberg’s pertinent drama about press freedom, followed with six nominations. The other nominees for the top best drama prize are British World War Two tale “Dunkirk,” gay romance “Call Me By Your Name” and the quirky dramedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”

The Golden Globes are chosen by about 90 journalists belonging to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but they often foreshadow picks for the Oscars, the movie industry’s highest awards.

“The Shape of Water” and “The Post” are also among front-runners for Oscars in March. the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announces its own nominations on Wednesday.

“Call Me By Your Name” took 10 years to get made. It also brought first-time Golden Globe nominations for actors Timothee Chalamet, 21, and Armie Hammer, 31. Chalamet also appears in another Golden Globes contender, “Lady Bird,” though he was not nominated for that role.

The Italian director of “Call Me By Your Name,” Luca Guadagnino, in a statement called it “a great cinematic romance that challenged conventions and proved that love is love.”

Mother-daughter comedy “Lady Bird” got four nods, including for its star, Saiorse Ronan, and Laurie Metcalf, in her supporting role as the title character’s mother. However, first-time director Greta Gerwig was snubbed in an all-male list for that category.

Barnum musical “The Greatest Showman” and the ice-skating mockumentary “I, Tonya.”

Australian actress and producer Margot Robbie, in her first Golden Globe nod, also was nominated for her starring role in “I, Tonya,” which tells the story of Tonya Harding and the infamous 1994 attack on rival U.S. figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. Allison Janney was nominated for playing Harding’s mother.

“There were a lot of people who said this project was impossible to make. I‘m really glad we didn’t listen to them,” Robbie, 27, told Reuters.

Movie studio Twentieth Century Fox and its Fox Searchlight unit for independent film dominated the nominations, sharing a total of 27 nods.

British actor Gary Oldman, 59, said he was “amazed, flattered and very proud” of his first Golden Globe nomination for his role as British wartime leader Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour.”

Triple Oscar winner Day-Lewis was recognized for “Phantom Thread,” which he has said will be his last as an actor.

Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC.

The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.

Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended.

“When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”

(Reuters) - Firefighters, taking advantage of a lull in the winds, on Monday held in check a massive Southern California wildfire that has torched hundreds of buildings and charred an area larger than New York City.

The Thomas Fire ignited a week ago and has burned 231,700 acres, in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, about 100 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) officials said at a news conference. It continued to grow on Monday, but at a slower pace, burning an additional several hundred acres.

The fire threatens 18,000 structures, including some in the wealthy enclave of Montecito where a number of celebrities have their homes.

Hot and dry Santa Ana winds, which blow from the deserts to the ocean, allowed the fire to explode in size last week. But gusts were light on Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Kathy Hoxsie said, even though the air was warm and dry.

The fire crept along ridge lines above Montecito and the city of Santa Barbara, and firefighters were bracing to keep it from coming downhill into those communities, officials said.

Most of the nearly 900 homes, outbuildings and businesses destroyed by the fire are in neighboring Ventura County, where the blaze first erupted.

Arthur Hurtz, 59, is among the local residents coming to terms with being homeless. He fled from his house in the city of Ventura overlooking the Pacific Ocean last week, just minutes before a wall of flames engulfed it, he said.

“It’s completely gone. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Hurtz, who is now staying at an emergency shelter.

The fire, in addition to destroying buildings, has damaged about 180 structures and ranks as the fifth-largest wildfire on record in California, according to Cal Fire.

The fire, for which investigators were still seeking to determine the cause, was 20 percent contained on Monday evening, up from 15 percent earlier in the day.

Public schools in Santa Barbara and some school systems nearby have canceled classes this week and will not reconvene until the annual winter break is completed in January, said Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider.

“Our house is under threat of being burned,” DeGeneres wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “We just had to evacuate our pets.”

A spokesman for DeGeneres declined to provide any other details on Monday.

Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground.

Karime Macias is the wife of former ruling party Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte, who is awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement and organized crime, in a case that public auditors said was the worst they had ever seen in Mexico.

In the letter, which the news site posted online, Macias said she was forced to leave the country and shelter in the UK because of “persecution” at home.

Reuters did not obtain the letter and could not verify its authenticity. Macias’ lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. Macias has not been charged with any crime.

Neither the attorney general’s office nor the Veracruz government responded to requests for comment.

Macias confirmed in the letter that diaries in which she had reportedly written “I deserve abundance” repeatedly were hers, and said that her phrases were of a spiritual nature.

Macias said she wanted back personal items including paintings, luxury pens, golf clubs and books that she said were seized by prosecutors without a warrant, adding that she feared other items found were planted there.

In April, Duarte was arrested in a Guatemala hotel where he had been with his wife after fleeing the country. He has denied any wrongdoing, and Macias was not detained.

Top Mexican auditor ASF said in 2016 that the irregularities in public funds under Duarte were the highest amount it had ever seen.

Prosecutors say Duarte headed an organization consisting of at least nine other people, whose criminal operations were carried out in Veracruz, the eastern Gulf state of Campeche and Mexico City between 2011 and 2016.

At a hearing in July, a judge gave prosecutors six months to proceed with the investigation against Duarte.

He is one of four ex-governors detained this year from President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.

A Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen’s civil war blockaded ports last month after a missile was fired toward Riyadh.

Jamie McGoldrick, the humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, said the blockade has since been eased, but the situation remained dire.

“The continuing blockade of ports is limiting supplies of fuel, food and medicines; dramatically increasing the number of vulnerable people who need help,” McGoldrick said in a statement.

“The lives of millions of people, including 8.4 million Yemenis who are a step away from famine, hinge on our ability to continue our operations and to provide health, safe water, food, shelter and nutrition support,” he added.

That marked an increase from past U.N. estimates of around 8 million people on the brink of famine.

The coalition accuses Iran of sending weapons to its Houthi allies, including missile parts, through Yemen’s main Hodeidah port, were most food supplies enter.

Saudi state television said on Monday a U.N delegation of experts has arrived in Riyadh to meet the coalition and the Yemeni government the coalition supports “to prevent the transfer of weapons and rockets to Houthis”.

Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with weapons, saying the U.S. and Saudi allegations are “baseless and unfounded”.

The United Nations says food shortages caused by the warring parties blocking supplies has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

The Saudis intervened in neighboring Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis advanced on the southern port city of Aden and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government into exile.

The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and triggered a cholera epidemic that has infected about 1 million people.

The U.S. government on Friday called on the Saudi-led military coalition to facilitate the free flow of humanitarian aid to all of Yemen’s ports and through Sana‘a airport.

A senior State Department official told reporters in Geneva on Monday that the United States had provided nearly $638 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen in the U.S. fiscal year 2017 that ended on Sept 30.

“We have called on both sides to stop the fighting and seek a political solution to the problem,” the official said.

He said the United States had made its position clear to its allies to end the blockade and called on the Houthis to allow access for humanitarian supplies as “there are shocking shortage of food, fuel and medicines that are causing great suffering”.",More than 8 million Yemenis 'a step away from famine': U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/yemen-security-un/more-than-8-million-yemenis-a-step-away-from-famine-u-n-idINKBN1E60BT?il=0

Amazon Studios’ ground-breaking transgender comedy “Transparent” and its Golden Globe-winning star Jeffrey Tambor were notably absent from Monday’s nominations list, as well as Netflix political drama “House of Cards” and its Globe-winning star Kevin Spacey.

The omissions follow sexual misconduct allegations against Tambor and Spacey, who was dropped from the upcoming sixth season of “House of Cards.”

Tambor has denied allegations by two actresses and Spacey has issued an apology to one of his multiple accusers. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the accusations.

The comedy series race opened up to include the return after 11 years of NBC’s “Will & Grace” sitcom, alongside “black-ish,” “Master of None,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and single mother tale “SMILF.”

Psychological thriller “The Sinner” edged into the limited series category, which was dominated by Emmy champion “Big Little Lies” garnering a leading six nods including best limited series or TV movie and acting nods for leads Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon.

Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) premium cable channel HBO (TWX.N) led all networks with a total of 12 nominations, followed by streaming platform Netflix Inc. (NFLX.O) with nine nods.

A sheen of futurism, fear of missing out, a lack of fundamental value, and an inability of big backers to sell without crashing the market are factors pumping up the digital currency’s price.

The rise in value has been astonishing, from $8.74 when Breakingviews first wrote on bitcoin in 2011, to over $15,500 on Thursday morning. The trajectory has gone exponential in recent days, with the price surging by more than 20 percent in the past 24 hours.

It’s a much more rapid version of what happens with hot technology startups. Funding rounds ratchet the valuations higher and higher, with only increasing investor demand, the previous valuation and a distant promise of huge potential to guide them. That’s how Theranos, the upstart blood-testing firm, got to its peak valuation of $9 billion. Whereas bitcoin, in enthusiasts’ minds, will replace the dollar, Elizabeth Holmes’ brainchild was going to replace every unpleasant, cumbersome blood test with a single finger-prick.

The Theranos technology didn’t work, and its evaluation evaporated. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s continued buoyancy in fact undermines any potential usefulness. Holders have a hard time psychologically using their coins to purchase anything. In 2010, a software developer famously bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. Nobody wants to be the guy who paid over $150 million for lunch.

Crypto-currencies are, however, excellent vehicles for speculation. They have no objective value, so – like a startup – their worth is derived from the narrative of what has, so far, been a steadily rising chart. Demand is swamping supply. The value of all bitcoins is a bit over $250 billion, and volume hit a record $28 billion or so over the past 24 hours, according to coinmarketcap.com. The similarly sized SPDR S&P 500 ETF trades multiples of this on a typical day. The exchange-traded fund’s relatively small moves in value indicate much more balanced trading.

Big holders of bitcoin can’t, therefore, sell in any size without the risk of tanking the price – which could kill the momentum for good. They might want to think about doing so, though, to make sure they don’t get caught out by a rush for the door. The danger if bitcoin’s credibility is punctured is an accelerated, Theranos-like bloodbath.",Breakingviews - Bitcoin looks like speeded-up unicorn hype,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-bitcoin-breakingviews/breakingviews-bitcoin-looks-like-speeded-up-unicorn-hype-idUSKBN1E134G

May, weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority at a June election, rescued an agreement last week to move the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union on to a second phase after easing the concerns of her Northern Irish allies over the future role of the border with EU member Ireland.

But the discussion of Britain’s trade relationship with the EU after Brexit contains many pitfalls and could widen differences among her top team of ministers, or cabinet, over how Britain should look after it leaves the bloc.

In a statement to parliament, May took to task those who doubted that she could move the talks beyond the initial stage of agreeing terms on how much Britain should pay, citizens’ rights and the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

“This is good news for people who voted leave who were worried we were so bogged down in the tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen,” she told parliament.

“It is good news for people who voted remain who were worried were going to crash out without a deal.”

May will head to Brussels on Thursday for a summit meeting at which she expects the leaders of the other 27 EU states to approve an assessment by negotiators that the sides have made “sufficient progress” to move on to phase two.

TROUBLES AHEAD

The deal to launch further talks looked in jeopardy a week ago when May was forced to abandon a choreographed meeting in Brussels intended to seal the deal after her allies in Northern Ireland expressed fears she was proposing a special status for the region - out of sync with the rest of the United Kingdom.

After days of diplomacy, there was a compromise - if no overall Brexit deal is secured, Britain will keep “full alignment” with those rules of the EU’s single market that help cooperation between Ireland’s north and south.

But those words have reverberated in both London and Belfast, with Brexit minister David Davis saying they were more “a statement of intent” than a legally binding move.

On Monday, Davis told LBC radio his words had been taken out of context and denied he was backing away from the commitment, which the EU described as “a deal between gentlemen”.

“And it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government,” the European Commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels.

Davis’ comments may have been aimed at members of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s Conservative minority government in parliament after the party expressed concerns about how alignment could work without Britain staying in the EU’s single market and customs union.

Or he may have wanted to ease the fears of some campaigners for Britain to leave the EU, who say the possibility of having to follow the bloc’s rules would mean that they would have Brexit in name only.

But May said the commitments made in the first round of talks -- which includes a payment of 35-39 billion pounds over many years to meet EU obligations -- were necessary to sever ties with the bloc.

“In doing so we can move on to building the bold new economic and security relationships that can underpin the new deep and special partnership we all want to see,” she said.

Putin, who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March, made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia’s Hmeymim air base in Syria - his first since Russia intervened in the conflict. He held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces.

The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting his Egyptian and Turkish counterparts, Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given him to cast himself as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force.

The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad’s favor. Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal.

“In just over two years, Russia’s armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists,” Putin told Russian servicemen.

A “significant part” of the Russian force could now return home. “The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created,” said Putin. “The Motherland awaits you.”

Washington was skeptical about Putin’s statement.

“Russian comments about removal of their forces do not often correspond with actual troop reductions, and do not affect U.S. priorities in Syria,” said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon.

Putin made clear in any case that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback.

Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia’s help, saying the blood of Moscow’s “martyrs” had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army. It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past.

Russia’s main contribution has been air strikes, and with Iran-backed Shi’ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground, the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation.

Russia’s campaign, which has been extensively covered on state TV at home, has not caught the imagination of most Russians. But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention.

The use of private military contractors, something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defense ministry, has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low.

Officially, less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign, but the real number, including private contractors, is estimated to be much higher.

ELECTORAL BOOST?

Russia’s “mission accomplished” moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters.

Though polls show he will easily win, they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics, and Putin’s supporters are keen to get him re-elected on a big turnout, which in their eyes confers legitimacy.

Putin, who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia’s political landscape for the last 17 years, told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors.

Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags, Putin said his military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a “sovereign independent state.”

Slideshow (4 Images)

“I congratulate you!” Putin told the servicemen.

Putin is keen to organize a special event in Russia - the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution.

When asked about Putin’s announcement, Yahya Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Geneva, said it welcomed any step that brought Syria closer to real peace.

Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces, its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback.

Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria’s Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous “on a permanent basis,” said Putin.

Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining center.

However, Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities.

“We’ve seen such announcements before, which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared,” said one European diplomat who declined to be named.

“The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva (peace talks). Absent that, the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation.”","Putin, in Syria, says mission accomplished, orders partial Russian pull-out",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1E50Z7

Lead researcher Sarah Tabrizi, professor of clinical neurology at University College London, said the ability of the drug to tackle the underlying cause of Huntington’s by lowering levels of a toxic protein was “ground-breaking”.
“The key now is to move quickly to a larger trial to test whether IONIS-HTT(Rx) slows disease progression,” she said in a statement on Monday.

The success in the early-stage clinical trial has prompted Roche to exercise its option to license the product, called IONIS-HTT(Rx), at a cost of $45 million.

Lead researcher Sarah Tabrizi, professor of clinical neurology at University College London, said the ability of the drug to tackle the underlying cause of Huntington’s by lowering levels of a toxic protein was “ground-breaking”.

“The key now is to move quickly to a larger trial to test whether IONIS-HTT(Rx) slows disease progression,” she said in a statement on Monday.

Ionis senior vice president of research Frank Bennett said the protein reductions observed in the study “substantially exceeded our expectations” and that the drug was also well tolerated.

However, experts cautioned that the results were still early and the ability of the new medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients had yet to be demonstrated.

“The question is whether this is enough to make a difference to patients and their clinical course, and for that we will have to wait for bigger trials,” said Roger Barker of the University of Cambridge, who was also involved in the research.

Huntington’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting mental abilities and physical control that normally hits sufferers between the ages of 30 and 50 years before continually worsening over a 10- to 25-year period.

There is currently no effective disease-modifying treatment for the condition, with existing medicines focused only on managing disease symptoms.

Ionis said Roche would now be responsible for all IONIS-HTT(Rx) development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs.

The drug uses an approach called antisense to stop a gene producing a particular protein. The technique has already led to a drug for spinal muscular atrophy that was approved last year.

Oct. 31, 2017 - Sayfullo Saipov drove a truck down a lower Manhattan bike lane, killing eight people, including five Argentinians who were in the city to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation. A police officer shot Saipov, 29, and arrested him. The Uzbek immigrant has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and other counts.

March 20, 2017 - James Harris Jackson, a 28-year-old white man, stabbed Timothy Caughman, an African-American, multiple times with a sword. Caughman later died of his injuries and Jackson told police he traveled to the city from Maryland to kill black men.

September 2016 - Three bombs exploded in the New York area, two in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood and one in New Jersey, wounding 31 people. Several unexploded bombs were also found. The suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahimi of New Jersey, was captured after a shootout with police. Rahimi, who was born in Afghanistan, was influenced by anti-American materials believed to be produced by Islamist militant group al Qaeda, prosecutors said.

May 2010 - Times Square was evacuated when a car bomb that failed to explode was found in a sport utility vehicle. Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized American and Taliban-trained militant, later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

March 2008 - An individual detonated a small pipe bomb in front of the U.S. Armed Forces recruiting station in Times Square. No one was injured.

December 2004 - A firebomb exploded on a crowded subway train in lower Manhattan, injuring 48 people. Six days earlier, a firebomb went off on a subway in Manhattan’s Harlem section, injuring two teen-agers. Edward Leary, 50, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, was sentenced to 94 years in prison in the two bombings. The second bomb went off at his feet, leaving him critically burned.

Sept. 11, 2001 - Members of al Qaeda flew two passenger planes into the north and south towers of Manhattan’s World Trade Center.

O acordo firmado pela AirBus e os familiares foi homologado pela juíza da 14ª Vara Cível do Rio de Janeiro, Aline Gomes Espíndola.

“O processo tem mais de 15 volumes e os beneficiários foram divididos em grupos. Os valores a receber por beneficiário são variáveis, levando em conta fatores como a proximidade de parentesco com a vítima”, informou o Tribunal de Justiça do Rio de Janeiro.

Fatores como expectativa de vida, produtividade também foram levados em conta para a definição de cada indenização a ser paga a parentes que participaram dessa ação.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, took his own case to Egypt on Monday and was expected to fly to Turkey for a meeting of Muslim countries this week, cementing support from leaders who say the U.S. move was a dire error.

President Donald Trump announced last Wednesday the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, breaking with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city’s status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a rocket into Israel and the Israeli military said it responded with air strikes and tank fire targeting a position of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the enclave.

On the ground in the Palestinian territories, violent clashes with Israeli security forces in which scores of Palestinians have been injured and several killed since the U.S. announcement last week appeared to have mostly subsided.

Netanyahu, on his first visit to EU headquarters in Brussels, said Trump’s move helped peace, “because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace”.

Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war, considers the entire city to be its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

The Trump administration says it remains committed to the peace process and its decision does not affect Jerusalem’s future borders or status. It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.

But even Israel’s closest European allies have rejected that logic and say recognizing Israel’s capital unilaterally risks inflaming violence and further wrecking the chance for peace.

After a breakfast meeting between Netanyahu and EU foreign ministers, Sweden’s top diplomat said no European at the closed-door meeting had voiced support for Trump’s decision, and no country was likely to follow the United States in announcing plans to move its embassy.

“I have a hard time seeing that any other country would do that and I don’t think any other EU country will do it,” Margot Wallstrom told reporters.

Israel’s position does appear to have more support from some EU states than others. Last week, the Czech foreign ministry said it would begin considering moving the Czech Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while Hungary blocked a planned EU statement condemning the U.S. move.

But Prague later said it accepted Israel’s sovereignty only over West Jerusalem, and Budapest said its long-term position seeking a two-state solution in the Middle East had not changed.

On Monday, Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said of Trump’s decision: “I‘m afraid it can’t help us.”

“I‘m convinced that it is impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution,” Zaoralek said. “We are talking about an Israeli state but at the same time we have to speak about a Palestinian state.”

The Palestinian president, Abbas, met Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Cairo, as well as the head of the Arab League. Egypt, a U.S. ally with a peace treaty with Israel, has brokered Israeli-Palestinian deals in the past.

“DUNGEON FOR MUSLIMS”

Moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem would have “dangerous effects on peace and security in the region”, Sisi said on Monday at an earlier meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Abbas was also due to fly to Turkey. Trump’s announcement has triggered a war of words between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Netanyahu, straining ties between the two U.S. allies which were restored only last year after a six-year breach that followed the Israeli storming of a Turkish aid ship.

On Sunday, Erdogan called Israel a “terror state”. Netanyahu responded by saying he would accept no moral lectures from Erdogan who he accused of bombing Kurdish villages, jailing opponents and supporting terrorists.

On Monday Erdogan took aim directly at Washington over Trump’s move: “The ones who made Jerusalem a dungeon for Muslims and members of other religions will never be able to clean the blood from their hands,” he said in a speech in Ankara. “With their decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United States has become a partner in this bloodshed.”

Trump’s announcement triggered days of protests across the Muslim world and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

In Beirut, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest at a march backed by Hezbollah, the heavily-armed Iran-backed Shi‘ite group whose leader called last week for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel. An announcer led the crowd in chants of “Death to America! Death to Israel!”

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah told the crowd by video link the group was turning its focus back toward the fight against Israel: “Today the axis of resistance, including Hezbollah, will return as its most important priority ... Jerusalem and Palestine and the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance in all its factions.”

“STOP PAMPERING”

Netanyahu, who has been angered by the EU’s search for closer business ties with Iran, said Europeans should emulate Trump’s move and press the Palestinians to do so, too.

“It’s time that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state and also recognize the fact that it has a capital. It’s called Jerusalem,” he said. In comments filmed later on his plane, he said he had told the Europeans to “stop pampering the Palestinians”, who “need a reality check”.

The decision to recognize Jerusalem could also strain Washington’s ties with another of its major Muslim allies, Saudi Arabia, which has sought closer relations with Washington under Trump than under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Saudi Arabia shares U.S. and Israeli concerns about the increasing regional influence of Iran, and was seen as a potential broker for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal. But Saudis have suggested that unilateral decisions over Jerusalem make any such rapprochement more difficult.

Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States and veteran ex-security chief, published a strongly-worded open letter to Trump on Monday.

“Bloodshed and mayhem will definitely follow your opportunistic attempt to make electoral gain,” the prince wrote in the letter, published in the Saudi newspaper al-Jazeera.

“Your action has emboldened the most extreme elements in the Israeli society ... because they take your action as a license to evict the Palestinians from their lands and subject them to an apartheid state,” he added. “Your action has equally emboldened Iran and its terrorist minions to claim that they are the legitimate defenders of Palestinian rights.”

Bahtiyar Duysak, 28, said he clicked “a few wrong things which I shouldn’t have done” on Nov. 2, his last day at Twitter, causing Trump’s @realDonaldTrump account - which has 44 million followers - to be taken offline for 11 minutes.

At the time, Twitter blamed a customer support employee on their last day at work and has since said it has taken steps to prevent such an incident happening again. Trump blamed a “rogue employee” for the temporary loss of his account.

In an interview in Frankfurt, Duysak told Reuters he wasn’t paying attention when a complaint came in an hour before he was to leave Twitter’s San Francisco office for the last time, after cutting short a six-month assignment.

He thought he was dealing with one of many fake Trump accounts.

“You should always double-check things before taking an action,” Duysak told Reuters Television.

Twitter has not confirmed whether Duysak was the ex-employee responsible. The company declined to comment on Duysak’s actions or its investigation into the matter when contacted by Reuters.

Duysak said that some of Trump’s posts since the incident - in particular his retweeting of anti-Islamic videos posted by a British far-right fringe group - were a breach of Twitter’s rules banning hate speech.

“You don’t need to be an expert to understand that a policy violation has happened, that the rules were broken and that this can lead to hatred being spread,” he said.

Twitter said it had no comment, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.

After stints at Youtube and Google, Duysak joined Twitter as a safety policy operations agent on July 24, according to correspondence seen by Reuters. The job involved checking violations of Twitter’s rules that could not be dealt with by its automatic computer systems.

Duysak, born in Germany to a family of Turkish origin, left the United States a few days after the incident and returned to his home town of Paderborn. He said he had hired a lawyer who liaised with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and assured him he had no case to answer.

Auch die Regionalmacht Saudi-Arabien, ein enger Verbündeter der USA, sprach offiziell von einer unverantwortlichen Entscheidung, die die Friedensbemühungen zurückwerfe. Hinter den Kulissen jedoch werbe das Königreich für einen Friedensplan, der im US-Präsidialamt entwickelt werde, heißt es in Palästinenserkreisen.

Trump hat mit seiner Entscheidung, die US-Botschaft von Tel Aviv nach Jerusalem zu verlegen, eine seit Jahrzehnten bestehende US-Position aufgegeben. Bislang unterstützten die USA die Forderung der Staatengemeinschaft, dass der Status Jerusalems in einem Friedensvertrag zwischen Israel und den Palästinensern geregelt werden soll. Beide erheben Ansprüche auf die Stadt, die sowohl Juden als auch Muslimen und Christen als heilig gilt.

Das saudische Königshaus kam daher nicht umhin, Trumps Vorstoß zu kritisieren. Inoffiziell sagen jedoch Insider, dass Saudi-Arabien mit an Bord sei bei der Entwicklung einer breiteren US-Strategie für einen Nahost-Friedensplan, der noch in einem frühen Stadium sei.

KUSHNERS ANGEBLICHE FRIEDENSPLAN-IDEE

Vier palästinensische Politiker berichteten, der saudiarabische Kronprinz Mohammed bin Salman und Palästinenserpräsident Mahmud Abbas hätten bereits über Details einer umfassenden politischen Übereinkunft gesprochen, die Trump und sein Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner im ersten Halbjahr 2018 vorstellen wollten. Einer der Insider, die alle nicht namentlich genannt werden wollten, sagte, Prinz Mohammed habe Abbas im November gebeten, die Bemühungen der USA zu unterstützen. Ein anderer berichtete, der Kronprinz habe zu Abbas gesagt: “Haben Sie Geduld. Sie werden gute Nachrichten hören. Der Friedensprozess wird vorankommen.”

Das Verhältnis zwischen den USA und Saudi-Arabien hat sich unter Trump deutlich verbessert. Was sie zusammenschweißt ist der gemeinsame Feind Iran. Der 36-jährige Kushner, dessen Familie gute Beziehungen zum israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Benjamin Netanjahu hat, soll außerdem enge persönliche Kontakte zu dem 32-jährigen Prinzen Mohammed aufgebaut haben.

PALÄSTINENSER BEFÜRCHTEN UNZUREICHENDES ANGEBOT TRUMPS

Palästinensische Politiker und viele Vertreter arabischer Staaten hegen nach Trumps Jerusalem-Entscheidung die Befürchtung, dass er zusammen mit Israel den Palästinensern eine einschränkte Selbstverwaltung in den von ihnen bewohnten Gebieten des Westjordanlands anbieten werde. Diese Gebiete bilden einen Flickenteppich zwischen jüdischen Siedlungen im besetzten Westjordanland. Auch ein Rückkehrrecht für die in den Kriegen 1948 und 1967 vertriebenen Palästinenser dürfte in dem Angebot fehlen, so die Vermutungen.

Ein palästinensischer Insider sagte, genau dies sei Inhalt des Vorschlags, den Kronprinz Mohammed vermutlich im Auftrag Kushners Präsident Abbas unterbreitet habe. Danach sollten die jüdischen Siedlungen bestehen bleiben, ein Rückkehrrecht für die Kriegsflüchtlinge sei nicht vorgesehen, und Israel solle für die Kontrolle der Grenzen verantwortlich sein. Abgesehen von etwas mehr Selbstverwaltung für die Palästinenser würde dies wohl lediglich den Status Quo festschreiben und wäre von den Minimalforderungen der Palästinenser weit entfernt. Abbas habe diese Pläne zurückgewiesen und dies Prinz Mohammed auch deutlich gemacht, sagte der Insider.

Das US-Präsidialamt erklärte, Kushner habe solche Details nicht mit dem Kronprinzen besprochen. Auch habe Kushner Prinz Mohammed nicht gebeten, mit Abbas über den Plan zu sprechen.

Nach Informationen aus Palästinenserkreisen hat Trump in einem Telefongespräch mit Abbas versucht, die Wogen wegen der Jerusalem-Entscheidung zu glätten. Trump soll zu Abbas gesagt haben: “Ich habe einige Vorschläge, die Ihnen gefallen werden.” Details habe er auch auf Drängen Abbas’ nicht genannt.

INSIDER: UNTERSCHÄTZEN SIE NICHT DEN GESCHÄFTSMANN IN TRUMP

Ein saudiarabischer Insider sagte: “Unterschätzen Sie nicht den Geschäftsmann in Trump.” Er habe immer von einem ultimativen Deal gesprochen. “Ich glaube nicht, dass unsere Regierung etwas akzeptierten würde, wenn es da nicht ein Zuckerstückchen gäbe, welches (König Salman und der Kronprinz) in der arabischen Welt verkaufen könnten.” Er nannte in dem Zusammenhang einen eigenen Staat für die Palästinenser.

Einige Nahostexperten wie Shadi Hamid von der Brookings Institution in Washington gehen davon aus, dass der Widerstand vieler arabischer Staaten gegen Trumps Jerusalem-Entscheidung nicht sehr stark sein wird. Sie stünden Israel vor allem in der Gegnerschaft zum Iran heute näher als je zuvor, sagte er. Und hätte Saudi-Arabien ernsthaft Probleme mit der Jerusalem-Entscheidung gehabt, hätte es Trump sicher gedrängt, diesen Schritt nicht zu gehen, schrieb er in einem Artikel des Magazins “The Atlantic”.

The bread, made from flour ground from dried crickets as well as wheat flour and seeds, contains more protein than normal wheat bread. Each loaf contains about 70 crickets and costs 3.99 euros ($4.72), compared with 2 to 3 euros for a regular wheat loaf.

“It offers consumers with a good protein source and also gives them an easy way to familiarize themselves with insect-based food,” said Juhani Sibakov, head of innovation at Fazer Bakeries.

The demand to find more food sources and a desire to treat animals more humanely have raised interest in using insects as a protein source in several Western countries.

In November, Finland joined five other European countries - Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark - in allowing insects to be raised and marketed for food use.

Sibakov said Fazer had developed the bread since last summer. It had to wait for legislation to be passed in Finland for the launch.

“I don’t taste the difference ... It tastes like bread,” said Sara Koivisto, a student from Helsinki after trying the new product.

Due to a limited supply of crickets, the insect-bread will initially only be sold in 11 Fazer bakery stores located in Helsinki region hypermarkets, but the company plans to offer it in all 47 of its stores by next year.

The company buys its cricket flour from the Netherlands, but said it was also looking for local suppliers.

Fazer, a family business with sales of about 1.6 billion euros last year, did not give a sales target for the product.

Insect-eating, or entomophagy, is common in much of the world. The United Nations estimated last year that at least 2 billion people eat insects and more than 1,900 species have been used for food.

In Western countries, edible bugs are gaining traction in niche markets, particularly among those seeking a gluten-free diet or wanting to protect the environment because farming insects uses less land, water and feed than animal husbandry.",Finland baker launches bread made from crushed crickets,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DN17E

Britain’s opposition Labour party says it may move parts of the central bank to Birmingham. That may appeal to voters, but both the BBC and HSBC have found relocating out of the capital expensive and difficult. The idea also ignores the reason London exerts such a strong pull.

The proposal in a report commissioned by Labour financial policy chief John McDonnell fits the party’s radical image. McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have been rattling British business in recent months with proposals to renationalise railways, energy companies and postal services. Now they want to shake up financial services.

The new proposal suggests sending parts of the Bank of England to other cities like Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, Newcastle and Plymouth. The idea is that moving the central bank would prompt private institutions – and jobs – to follow. Redistributing some of the 48 billion pounds that the City of London contributed to Britain’s national income in 2014 – about 3 percent of the total – would help ease regional inequality.

This ignores the cluster effect at work in the City, though. The global and domestic banks that gather in the historic financial centre benefit from the plumbing that has evolved over centuries. Law firms, consultants and institutional investors are all close at hand. Companies pay a premium in terms of office costs and salaries to be near this pool of expertise.

HSBC is a prime example of the kind of challenges that await Labour’s proposal. Europe’s largest bank has faced an uphill battle to persuade 1,000 staff to move from London to the new headquarters of its UK subsidiary in Birmingham. This is despite sweeteners including help with property and schools in Britain’s second-largest city. Similarly, the BBC initially struggled to convince its staff to make the move to new studios near Manchester.

The one-month future surged more than 20 percent from the open before trading below $18,000 on Monday morning – still a premium to the crypto-currency itself. Considering the price of bitcoin has risen two-thirds this month alone, that seems fairly sedate. Volume was roughly $50 million, Breakingviews calculates, less than 0.5 percent of actual bitcoin trading in the prior 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Futures have real-world value, for example allowing producers or consumers of a commodity to insure themselves against price movements, or helping investors to hedge their positions. In the bitcoin world, there are so-called miners with investments in processing power and hefty costs like electricity who could use the contracts this way, but that’s about it. And with bitcoin soaring more than 15-fold in 2017 to well over $16,000 early on Monday, selling bitcoin futures short is likely to be prohibitively expensive.

Most market players will be cautious until the contracts settle down. There are, though, other reasons for concern. Bitcoin futures aren’t perfect proxies for the real thing, partly because they will be settled in dollars not the crypto-currency, which trades at different dollar prices in different places. CBOE settlements, for example, will be based on bitcoin’s value on the Gemini Exchange, established by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame.

CME’s futures, launching next weekend, will settle at a reference price drawn from multiple exchanges. One opportunity could be arbitrage, exploiting the pricing discrepancies. But it will take time for any patterns to emerge.

Proponents reckon the entry of two big, regulated U.S. exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring bitcoin exposure to retail investors.

Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearing houses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges – and their customers – can now ride the bitcoin bandwagon without touching the crypto-currency at all.",Breakingviews - Bitcoin futures set scene for more gambling,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-futures-breakingviews/breakingviews-bitcoin-futures-set-scene-for-more-gambling-idUKKBN1E51LF

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday called the worst attack on the organization in recent history.

Tanzania’s President John Magufuli said he was “shocked and saddened” by the deaths, which come amid rising violence against civilians, the army and U.N. troops in Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern borderlands.

The U.N. chief said the attack constituted a war crime and called on Congolese authorities to investigate and “swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice”.

“I want to express my outrage and utter heartbreak at last night’s attack,” Guterres told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York. “There must be no impunity for such assaults, here or anywhere else.”

The United Nations Security Council condemned the attack on Friday and held a moment of silence for the victims.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert wrote on Twitter that the United States was “appalled by the horrific attack”.

U.N. troops were still searching for three peacekeepers who went missing during the more than three-hour firefight that broke out at dusk on Thursday evening, Ian Sinclair, the director of the U.N. Operations and Crisis Centre, said.

U.N. officials said they suspected militants from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) staged the assault on the base in the town of Semuliki in North Kivu’s Beni territory.

The ADF is an Islamist rebel group that has been active in the area. Congo’s U.N. mission, MONUSCO, said it was coordinating a joint response with the Congolese army and evacuating wounded from the base.

Five Congolese soldiers were also killed in the raid, MONUSCO said in a statement. Congo’s army said only one of its soldiers was missing, however, while another had been injured, adding that 72 militants had been killed.

‘THEY DON‘T WANT US THERE’

Rival militia groups control parts of mineral-rich eastern Congo nearly a decade and a half after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease.

The area has been the scene of repeated massacres and at least 26 people died in an ambush in October.

The government and U.N. mission have blamed almost all the violence on the ADF but U.N. experts and independent analysts say other militia and elements of Congo’s own army have also been involved.

In response to the growing unrest, and in an effort to protect civilians, the U.N.’s Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix said MONUSCO had stepped up its activities in the area.

“They don’t want us there. And I think this attack is a response ... to our increasingly robust posture in that region,” he told reporters.

Thursday’s raid was the third attack on a U.N. base in eastern Congo in recent months.

Increased militia activity in the east and center of the country has added to insecurity in Congo this year amid political tensions linked to President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his mandate expired last December.

An election to replace Kabila, who has ruled Congo since his father’s assassination in 2001, has been repeatedly delayed and is now scheduled for December 2018.

Embora o trabalho seja escasso na localidade de 300 mil habitantes, as poucas perspectivas de Boa Vista atraem mais Rivera do que a vida em casa, onde seus seis filhos muitas vezes passam fome e as prateleiras dos mercados e hospitais estão cada vez mais vazias. “Não vejo futuro na Venezuela”, disse Rivera, que procura bicos nos semáforos da capital de Roraima, situada a 200 quilômetros da fronteira brasileira com o país andino.

Países da América Latina e também de outras regiões vêm recebendo um número crescente de venezuelanos em fuga da crise econômica, do crime e do que críticos afirmam ser um governo cada vez mais autoritário. A nação antes próspera, que abriga as maiores reservas de petróleo conhecidas do mundo, está lutando com uma recessão profunda, desemprego generalizado, escassez crônica de bens e uma inflação que em breve pode chegar a 2 mil por cento, segundo a Assembleia Nacional oposicionista. Ao menos 125 pessoas morreram neste ano em confrontos entre opositores do governo, apoiadores e policiais.

Como as condições locais pioram, cidades próximas como Boa Vista estão às voltas com uma das maiores imigrações da história recente da América Latina. Com infraestrutura, serviços públicos e empregos limitados para oferecer aos imigrantes, as autoridades brasileiras temem uma crise humanitária. Na semana passada, o governo de Roraima decretou uma “emergência social”, colocando os serviços locais em alerta devido à procura crescente por atendimentos de saúde e segurança.

“Os abrigos já estão cheios até o limite”, disse George Okoth-Obbo, chefe de operações do Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados (Acnur), após uma visita. “É uma situação muito difícil.” Ele ressaltou a onda de imigrantes que também atinge Trinidad e Tobago, país caribenho ao norte da Venezuela, e a Colômbia, vizinho andino do oeste, para onde centenas de milhares fugiram.

Nem mesmo o governo da Venezuela sabe ao certo quantos de seus 30 milhões de habitantes fugiram nos últimos anos. Alguns sociólogos estimaram o número em até 2 milhões, mas o governo de esquerda do presidente Nicolás Maduro questiona a cifra.

BRASIL NÃO ESTÁ PREPARADO

Ao contrário de imigrações anteriores, nas quais muitos profissionais venezuelanos partiram rumo a mercados nos quais seus serviços encontravam grande procura, muitos dos que partem agora têm poucas habilidades ou recursos – e ao imigrarem, exportam alguns dos males sociais com os quais sua terra natal vem lutando.

“Eles estão partindo por causa de problemas econômicos, de saúde e segurança pública, mas estão colocando muita pressão em países que têm suas próprias dificuldades”, disse Mauricio Santoro, cientista político da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

Autoridades internacionais estão comparando o êxodo venezuelano a outras movimentações em massa do passado latino-americano, como a dos refugiados que fugiram do Haiti após o terremoto de 2010 ou, pior, a fuga de 125 mil cubanos para os Estados Unidos de barco em 1980. O Brasil já recebeu até 40 mil venezuelanos, disse Okoth-Obbo. Pouco mais da metade deles pediu asilo, um processo burocrático que pode demorar dois anos. O pedido lhes garante o direito de ficar no Brasil enquanto a solicitação é analisada, e também lhes dá acesso a saúde, educação e outros serviços sociais. Alguns imigrantes em Boa Vista estão encontrando maneiras de sobreviver, procurando acomodação barata ou se hospedando nos poucos abrigos, como um ginásio local, providenciados pelas autoridades. Outros se tornam sem-teto, e alguns recorrem a crimes, como a prostituição, acrescentando problemas com a lei aos desafios sociais.

“Temos um problema muito sério que só irá piorar”, disse a prefeita de Boa Vista, Teresa Surita, acrescentando que as ruas antes tranquilas da cidade agora estão repletas de venezuelanos pobres.

Ao chegar de transporte público na cidade da fronteira venezuelana de Santa Elena, eles entram no Brasil a pé e depois pegam ônibus ou caronas até Boa Vista.

Com funcionários apenas durante o dia, o posto de fronteira acaba ficando aberto, permitindo que até 400 imigrantes entrem diariamente, de acordo com as autoridades.

“O governo brasileiro não está preparado para o que vem acontecendo”, disse Jesús López de Bobadilla, um padre católico que administra um centro de refugiados na fronteira. Ele serve café da manhã com frutas, café e pão para centenas de venezuelanos.

As escolas da capital receberam cerca de 1.000 crianças venezuelanas. O hospital local não tem mais leitos por causa da demanda maior por atendimento, inclusive de muitas gestantes do país vizinho. Em julho, um menino venezuelano de 10 anos morreu de difteria, uma doença que estava ausente de Roraima há tempos. Giuliana Castro, secretária de Segurança Pública do Estado, disse que tratar de imigrantes doentes é difícil por eles não terem estabilidade, como uma residência fixa. “Existe o risco de uma crise humanitária aqui”, declarou ela. A maioria dos imigrantes em Boa Vista disse que não pretende voltar à Venezuela até que as condições do país melhorem.

“Não havia leite nem vacinas”, contou Carolina Coronada, que trabalhava como contadora em Maracay, cidade do norte venezuelano. “Agora consigo dormir à noite, sem me preocupar em ser assaltada”.",ESPECIAL-Onda de imigrantes da Venezuela pode gerar crise humanitária em Roraima,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1E52GT-OBRWD

The Arab leaders accused Tehran and the Lebanese Shi’ite movement of destabilizing the Middle East, but they fell short of agreeing on concrete action.

The Arab League meeting capped a month in which the Middle East suddenly seemed to plunge toward a wider regional conflict. Saudi Arabia charged that a missile fired at its capital from Yemen on Nov. 4 was provided to Yemeni rebels by Iran and constituted “an act of war.” Saudi leaders then pushed Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri into a surprise resignation during a trip to Saudi Arabia as a way of exerting pressure on Iran and Hezbollah. “Wherever Iran is involved, there is nothing but devastation and chaos,” Hariri said in his resignation speech on Nov. 4, which was broadcast from the Saudi capital, Riyadh. He added, “Iran’s hands in the region will be cut off.”

These actions underscore a newly aggressive Saudi foreign policy, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is eager to challenge Iran more directly and has amassed tremendous power under the rule of his father, King Salman.

But forcing Hariri to resign and ratcheting up tensions with Iran over Yemen has backfired on the prince and his advisers. The lack of support from fellow Arab leaders for tougher action against Iran and Hezbollah shows that few Saudi allies are willing to confront Iran directly.

Saudi Arabia had invested years of political effort and tens of millions of dollars to support Hariri and his political movement in Lebanon, especially after the assassination of Hariri’s father, Rafik, in February 2005. The elder Hariri had served as Lebanon’s prime minister for more than a decade, and he became the country’s most prominent Sunni leader and Saudi Arabia’s most important Lebanese ally.

Saad Hariri took office in late 2016, forming a national unity government that included Hezbollah. The power-sharing agreement was approved by Iran and Saudi Arabia. But in recent months, Saudi leaders grew worried that Hariri, who has strong ties to Western and Sunni Arab leaders, was becoming a fig leaf for a government dominated by Hezbollah and its supporters, including Lebanese President Michel Aoun.

Saudi leaders thought that they would be able to push Hariri aside, withdraw political cover from Hezbollah, and make it easier for Sunni Arab states — along with the United States and Israel — to target the group. (After an earlier round of sanctions, the U.S. Congress is considering a new sanctions bill targeting Hezbollah and its funders.)

But after Hariri’s sudden departure, Lebanese from all political factions rallied around him and insisted that his resignation was invalid because Saudi leaders coerced him. As international concern grew that Hariri was being held captive by his Saudi patrons, French President Emmanuel Macron invited him to Paris. Hariri met with Macron on Nov. 18 and returned to Lebanon for the country's Nov. 22 Independence Day celebrations.

Tensions have eased over the past week, and it’s unlikely that the latest crisis will escalate into a military confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But while the prospect of direct clashes between the two regional rivals has eased, their ongoing proxy war is destabilizing the Middle East.

The two powers have backed competing factions in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. While the conflict is partly rooted in the historical Sunni-Shi’ite split within Islam, it’s mainly a struggle for regional political dominance between Shi’ite-led Iran and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia.

Their proxy battles, which now also involve other powers like Russia and the United States, are at the root of much of the death and destruction in the Middle East in recent years. They have cost hundreds of thousands of lives, especially in Syria, where more than 400,000 have been killed since the March 2011 uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which is supported by Iran and Hezbollah. The Syrian war has also produced more than 5 million refugees whose search for sanctuary has triggered political crises in neighboring countries as well as Europe.

In January 2015, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah died after 20 years in power. He was succeeded by his brother Salman, who quickly pursued a more aggressive foreign policy. Instead of relying on U.S. military intervention and battling Iran through surrogates and checkbook diplomacy, as his predecessor had done, the new king and his advisers launched a war against Houthi, mostly Shi’ite, rebels in Yemen in March 2015. As the war has dragged on, air strikes by Saudi Arabia and its allies caused most of the estimated 10,000 civilian deaths.

Saudi Arabia is now bogged down in the Yemen conflict. Despite intensive air strikes and a blockade, Riyadh and its allies still have not been able to dislodge the Houthis from Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.

Yemen has become a central arena of the proxy battle, especially after Saudi Arabia’s “act of war” accusation against Iran. The kingdom claimed that the ballistic missile it shot down on Nov. 4 en route to the Saudi capital had been smuggled into Yemen in parts. Saudi officials say members of Hezbollah and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps assembled the missile, and then helped Houthi rebels fire it from Yemeni territory. (Iran and Hezbollah denied involvement in the missile launch.)

Saudi leaders have since scaled back their efforts to declare Lebanon a hostile state. Already overstretched by Yemen and embroiled in a diplomatic crisis with Qatar, the kingdom cannot effectively challenge Hezbollah, Iran’s main ally in Lebanon, without assembling a broader Arab and international coalition. But this is still a dangerous moment in the Middle East. As long as Iran and Saudi Arabia view their rivalry as a zero-sum game — where one can only gain at the expense of the other — there is a risk of miscalculation that spirals out of control.","Commentary: How Saudi Arabia has overreached on Iran, Lebanon",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-how-saudi-arabia-has-overreached-on-iran-lebanon-idUSKBN1DL2K2

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.29 a barrel at 0253 GMT, up 60 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last close.

That marks the first time Brent has risen above $65 since June, 2015.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $58.30 a barrel, up 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement.

“Brent crude raced higher ... as news broke that the North Sea’s Forties Pipeline system would have to be shut down for a ‘number of weeks’ after a hairline crack was found in it,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “The pipeline ... is a significant component underpinning the Brent benchmark.”

Britain’s Forties oil pipeline, the country’s largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were revealed.

“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.

GOING WIDE

The jump in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices to almost $7 a barrel, up from around $5 last week, making U.S. oil exports more attractive. CL-LCO1=R

The cheaper WTI is also a result of rising U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.71 million bpd, levels not seen since the early 1970s.

U.S. production is now also not far off that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The rising U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, to support prices by withholding supplies.

OPEC and its allies started withholding supplies last January and currently plan to continue doing so throughout 2018.",Brent crude jumps above $65 for 1st time since 2015 after North Sea pipeline outage,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/brent-crude-jumps-above-65-for-1st-time-since-2015-after-north-sea-pipeline-outage-idUSKBN1E603J?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) was responding to comments on Saturday by Bangladesh Finance Minister Abul Maal A. Muhith who said he wanted to “wipe-out” the Manila-based bank.

The comments follow a Reuters story that Bangladesh Bank (BB) had asked the New York Federal Reserve of New York to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against RCBC seeking damages, according to several sources.

“RCBC has revealed everything it legally could to the (Philippine) Senate and its regulator, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. BB however, has concealed everything it could. The contrast is telling,” George dela Cuesta, head of legal affairs at RCBC, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Unidentified hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the New York Fed in February last year, using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.

Nearly two years later, there is no word on who was responsible and Bangladesh Bank has been able to retrieve only about $15 million, mostly from a Manila junket operator.

“BB is definitely partly to blame for the heist. Its refusal to be transparent is a continuing cover-up and a disservice to global efforts to combat cybercrime,” dela Cuesta said. “RCBC is clearly a victim of BB’s negligence.”

RCBC has blamed rogue employees and Philippine prosecutors have filed money laundering charges against a former RCBC bank manager and four people who owned the bank accounts where the funds were sent, but are not identifiable since the accounts were in fake names. They are the only people to be formally cited anywhere in the world in association with the crime.

RCBC was fined a record one billion pesos ($20 million) by the country’s central bank last year for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through it.

“BB must be sanctioned until it owns up and shares what it knows to prevent a repeat. Up to now, not one Bangladeshi has been identified in the inside job, much more hauled to the court,” dela Cuesta said.",Philippine bank accuses Bangladesh of heist 'cover-up',https://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-heist-bangladesh/philippine-bank-accuses-bangladesh-of-heist-cover-up-idINKBN1E60AB?il=0

The suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, was taken to a hospital after suffering burns from the explosive device, which was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties and did not fully ignite, officials said. Investigators told Reuters they believe the attack in midtown Manhattan was intended to be a suicide bombing.

The blast, which occurred around 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) in a busy underground passageway between the subway station underneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square subway station, sent commuters fleeing for the exits and police officers rushing to the scene, as officials scrambled to reroute trains and shut down streets.

Three people, including a police officer, suffered minor injuries.

The attack came just six weeks after police say an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians along a bike path in lower Manhattan, killing eight in an act for which Islamic State later claimed responsibility. In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood.

In recent years, numerous people claiming to be inspired by Islamic State have carried out attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States.

A law enforcement official familiar with the Ullah investigation said investigators have found evidence that he watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet.

‘AMATEUR-LEVEL’

The weapon used in Monday’s attack was “amateur-level,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference near the explosion site. He told CNN the homemade bomb may not have fully ignited, possibly limiting the damage.

Officials said the attempted bombing underscored New York City’s status as a target for such attacks, citing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people in all, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.

“Let’s be clear, as New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. “And let’s also be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack.”

In a statement, President Donald Trump said the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.

“America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,” he said.

The president also criticized the visa program that allowed Ullah to enter the United States in 2011 because he had family members already in the country, saying such family visas are “incompatible with national security.”

Ullah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, said Shameem Ahsan, consul general of Bangladesh in New York.

Authorities did not immediately comment on Ullah’s motives. When asked whether Ullah had claimed any connection to Islamic State, New York Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said, “He did make statements but we’re not going to talk about that right now.”

Several U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no immediate information indicating Ullah was previously known to any American spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militants or terrorism, though a connection could still be found.

Ullah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country’s police chief. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.

Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver’s license from 2012 to 2015, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.

Monday’s incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in a long tunnel that connects sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso.

‘EVERYBODY WAS SCARED’

The explosion turned a normal start to the work week into a chaotic scene.

“There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,” said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. “Everybody was scared and running and shouting.”

The bus terminal was temporarily closed, and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway travel was disrupted but later returned to normal.

In December, New York experiences a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store window displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows.

More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city’s busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Ten train lines stop at the station.

The bus terminal is the busiest in the United States, according to the Port Authority. On a typical weekday, about 220,000 passengers arrive or depart on more than 7,000 buses.

The bus terminal is adjacent to and above the subway station’s western section. A long, narrow underground tunnel connects that part of the station to its eastern section, and is used by thousands of commuters during rush hour.

The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening stock markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries.

Technology and energy stocks closed higher Monday, helping Wall Street shake off uncertainties following the explosion.","Subway bomber wounds self, three victims in New York",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-newyork-incident/subway-bomber-wounds-self-three-victims-in-new-york-idUKKBN1E51EI?il=0

The bid comes as Gemalto, the world’s largest maker of chips found in mobile phones and credit cards, is under pressure after posting four profit warnings in a year and having missed a chance to strengthen its security business through a large acquisition.

The combination would strengthen Atos in the burgeoning so-called Internet of Things (IoT) sector of internet-connected machinery and household devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors and European payment services on top of digital security, it said.

Atos said it delivered an offer to Gemalto’s board on Nov. 28.

Shortly after issuing the formal offer, Atos Chief Executive Thierry Breton said he had already received the backing of Gemalto’s biggest shareholder, France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.

“I’ve met the main shareholders and Bpi in particular,” Breton said in a call with reporters following the announcement of the unsolicited bid for Gemalto.

“Bpi is not only favorable to this operation of European consolidation, but it also authorized me to tell you about it,” he added.

Bpifrance holds 8.51 percent of Gemalto’s shares, according to the group’s last annual report. Gemalto and Bpifrance were not immediately reachable for comment.

STOCK PRESSURED

Gemalto had to postpone to March 2018 the presentation the presentation of its next multiyear strategic plan, after several profit warnings notably caused by slowing demand for credit card chips.

The group’s shares have shed 38 percent so far this year compared with an increase of 24 percent for Atos.

Since Breton took the helm of Atos in November 2008, the firm has multiplied its stock price by close to six times, outperforming French rival Capgemini (CAPP.PA) and U.S. companies Accenture (ACN.N) and IBM (IBM.N).

Atos’ revenue has more than doubled over the period to reach 11.7 billion euros in 2016, after having bought assets from Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), U.S. group Xerox (XRX.N) and France-based computer company Bull.

Gemalto had sales of 3.2 billion euros in 2016.

The all-cash bid reflects a price of 46 euros per Gemalto share, representing a 42 percent premium on the group’s last closing price, Atos said in a statement.

The bid would be financed by Atos’ existing cash resources and debt, the company said without elaborating.

Breton said that two banks had already given their approval for a potential loan.

The 26-year-old underwent shoulder surgery earlier this year and faced nine months on the sidelines but returned for Western Australia in October and scored 680 runs in all forms of cricket at an average of 68.

He has scored two centuries, a 95 and 80 in his 14 innings and is expected to be in competition with Peter Handscomb for a position in the third test lineup.

If selected, elder brother Shaun is likely to move to number five with Mitchell slotting in at six, where his medium-pace bowling will complement the all-out pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.

“I am renowned as the ‘glue’ of the fast bowling cartel,” Marsh told reporters in Perth on Tuesday.

“I did a bit of sucking up and I‘m back in their WhatsApp group. The cartel are happy to have me back. I got invited to dinner last night. It was a huge honour,” he added with a laugh.

While Marsh’s improved batting had no doubt put him back in the frame, the all-rounder said his reconstructed shoulder was holding up well to the rigours of bowling.

“Shoulder’s feeling really good, body’s feeling really good, got through the last two Shield games bowling, ready to go if I get the chance,” he said.

”I know I‘m in great form at the moment, I probably didn’t expect to get back in so soon after my injury. I’ve worked hard over the last nine months to get my body back into shape.

”If I get an opportunity to play, I’ll bowl as many overs as Smudger (captain Steve Smith) needs me to bowl.

“Rhythm-wise, the ball’s coming out really well, pace-wise I think I‘m up where I was 18 months ago.”

Marsh added that his possible test return on his home ground, which was hard and generating good pace, would be special if he gets to play with his brother, but the job was to wrap up the series with two tests remaining.

“It’d nice to be back playing for Australia and playing with Shaun again, it’s always special,” he said.

“But we’re playing an Ashes test and we have an opportunity to win the series so all I‘m focused on, if I get an opportunity, is doing my job for the team.”",Cricket: Mitchell Marsh raring to go if called in Perth test,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-ashes-marsh/cricket-mitchell-marsh-raring-to-go-if-called-in-perth-test-idINKBN1E609B

(Reuters) - Dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct toward teenagers, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore cast himself as a staunch ally of President Donald Trump at a rally on the eve of Tuesday’s election in Alabama.

Despite Trump’s endorsement for Moore, some polls suggest Democrat Doug Jones, 63, a former U.S. attorney, could pull off an upset victory by becoming the first non-Republican to be sent to the Senate by deeply conservative Alabama in two decades.

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and executive at the right-wing Breitbart News site, joined Moore in Midland City for the Monday night rally, labeled a “Drain the Swamp” event, in an echo of Trump’s 2016 campaign pledge to get rid of Washington insiders.

“I want to make America great again with President Trump,“ Moore said. ”I want America great, but I want America good, and she can’t be good until we go back to God.”

Moore, a 70-year-old conservative Christian and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, has been accused by several women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14.

Moore has denied any misconduct. Reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations.

The Alabama race has divided Trump’s Republican Party.

The sexual misconduct accusations prompted many senior Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to distance themselves from Moore.

”There’s a special place in hell for Republicans who should know better,” Bannon told the rally, framing the Alabama election as a showdown between establishment elites and populist power.

A Fox News Poll conducted on Thursday and released on Monday put Jones ahead of Moore, with Jones potentially taking 50 percent of the vote and Moore 40 percent. Fox said 8 percent of voters were undecided and 2 percent supported another candidate.

An average of recent polls by the RealClearPolitics website showed Moore ahead by a slight margin of 2.2 percentage points.

Trump taped a “robo-call” that the campaign has rolled out urging voters to back the Republican candidate in order to help support the president’s agenda.

Democrats also made robo-calls using two of their party’s own big guns - former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden.

‘RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY’

Jones has said he wanted to be a “voice for reason” for Alabama and has touted a record that includes prosecuting former Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham in which four girls were killed.

Jones has spent the past week rallying African-Americans, the most reliably Democratic voters in the state, and hammering Moore in television ads. He has told supporters that his campaign is a chance to be on the “right side of history for the state of Alabama.”

If Jones wins on Tuesday, Republicans would control the Senate by a slim 51-49 margin, giving Democrats much-needed momentum ahead of the November 2018 congressional elections, when control of both chambers of Congress will be at stake.

Moore’s campaign has cast Jones as a liberal out of step with Alabama voters, seizing on the Democrat’s support of abortion rights.

Many Republican officials in Alabama, including Governor Kay Ivey, say they will vote for Moore. But the state’s senior Republican senator, Richard Shelby, said he did not vote for Moore and instead backed a write-in candidate on his absentee ballot, telling CNN that Alabama “deserves better” than Moore.

Moore, who was twice removed from the state Supreme Court for refusing to abide by federal law, may find a chilly reception in Washington if he wins. Republican leaders have said

Moore could face an ethics investigation if Alabama voters send him to the U.S. Senate.

May, weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority at a June election, rescued an agreement last week to move the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union on to a second phase after easing the concerns of her Northern Irish allies over the future role of the border with EU member Ireland.

But the discussion of Britain’s trade relationship with the EU after Brexit contains many pitfalls and could widen differences among her top team of ministers, or cabinet, over how Britain should look after it leaves the bloc.

In a statement to parliament, May took to task those who doubted that she could move the talks beyond the initial stage of agreeing terms on how much Britain should pay, citizens’ rights and the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

“This is good news for people who voted leave who were worried we were so bogged down in the tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen,” she told parliament.

“It is good news for people who voted remain who were worried were going to crash out without a deal.”

May will head to Brussels on Thursday for a summit meeting at which she expects the leaders of the other 27 EU states to approve an assessment by negotiators that the sides have made “sufficient progress” to move on to phase two.

The deal to launch further talks looked in jeopardy a week ago when May was forced to abandon a choreographed meeting in Brussels intended to seal the deal after her allies in Northern Ireland expressed fears she was proposing a special status for the region - out of sync with the rest of the United Kingdom.

After days of diplomacy, there was a compromise - if no overall Brexit deal is secured, Britain will keep “full alignment” with those rules of the EU’s single market that help cooperation between Ireland’s north and south.

But those words have reverberated in both London and Belfast, with Brexit minister David Davis saying they were more “a statement of intent” than a legally binding move.

Slideshow (2 Images)

On Monday, Davis told LBC radio his words had been taken out of context and denied he was backing away from the commitment, which the EU described as “a deal between gentlemen”.

“And it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government,” the European Commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels.

Davis’ comments may have been aimed at members of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s Conservative minority government in parliament after the party expressed concerns about how alignment could work without Britain staying in the EU’s single market and customs union.

Or he may have wanted to ease the fears of some campaigners for Britain to leave the EU, who say the possibility of having to follow the bloc’s rules would mean that they would have Brexit in name only.

But May said the commitments made in the first round of talks -- which includes a payment of 35-39 billion pounds over many years to meet EU obligations -- were necessary to sever ties with the bloc.

“In doing so we can move on to building the bold new economic and security relationships that can underpin the new deep and special partnership we all want to see,” she said.

Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water,” a magical drama about a relationship between a strange river creature and a mute cleaner, collected a leading seven nods, including best drama, and director and acting nominations for Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins.

“Above all, ‘The Shape of Water’ is about love overcoming fear and embracing the Other,” Del Toro said in a statement.

“The Post,” Steven Spielberg’s pertinent drama about press freedom, followed with six nominations. The other nominees for the top best drama prize are British World War Two tale “Dunkirk,” gay romance “Call Me By Your Name” and the quirky dramedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”

The Golden Globes are chosen by about 90 journalists belonging to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but they often foreshadow picks for the Oscars, the movie industry’s highest awards.

“The Shape of Water” and “The Post” are also among front-runners for Oscars in March. the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announces its own nominations on Wednesday.

“Call Me By Your Name” took 10 years to get made. It also brought first-time Golden Globe nominations for actors Timothee Chalamet, 21, and Armie Hammer, 31. Chalamet also appears in another Golden Globes contender, “Lady Bird,” though he was not nominated for that role.

The Italian director of “Call Me By Your Name,” Luca Guadagnino, in a statement called it “a great cinematic romance that challenged conventions and proved that love is love.”

Mother-daughter comedy “Lady Bird” got four nods, including for its star, Saiorse Ronan, and Laurie Metcalf, in her supporting role as the title character’s mother. However, first-time director Greta Gerwig was snubbed in an all-male list for that category.

Other best comedy or musical film nominees included James Franco’s ”The Disaster Artist,“ about the making of the 2003 box office bomb ”The Room; “Get Out,” a satire on modern race relations set within a psychological thriller, the P.T. Barnum musical “The Greatest Showman” and the ice-skating mockumentary “I, Tonya.”

Australian actress and producer Margot Robbie, in her first Golden Globe nod, also was nominated for her starring role in “I, Tonya,” which tells the story of Tonya Harding and the infamous 1994 attack on rival U.S. figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. Allison Janney was nominated for playing Harding’s mother.

“There were a lot of people who said this project was impossible to make. I‘m really glad we didn’t listen to them,” Robbie, 27, told Reuters.

Movie studio Twentieth Century Fox and its Fox Searchlight unit for independent film dominated the nominations, sharing a total of 27 nods.

British actor Gary Oldman, 59, said he was “amazed, flattered and very proud” of his first Golden Globe nomination for his role as British wartime leader Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour.”

Triple Oscar winner Day-Lewis was recognized for “Phantom Thread,” which he has said will be his last as an actor.

Other first-time Golden Globe movie nominees included Britain’s Daniel Kaluuya for his breakout role in “Get Out,” Sam Rockwell as a dim-witted police officer in “Three Billboards,” and Vietnamese-American actress Hong Chau for her role as a dissident maid in “Downsizing.”

For television, British royal series ”The Crown,“ ”Game of Thrones,“ ”The Handmaid’s Tale, “Stranger Things” and “This Is Us” will compete for the best drama series award.

Inicialmente, a intenção do Palácio do Planalto era começar o debate da matéria apenas na próxima segunda-feira, mas houve um acerto com o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), para antecipar esse calendário.

Pelo novo cronograma, a proposta será discutida a partir desta quinta, após uma nova rodada de conversas do governo com sua base. A votação da proposta deverá ocorrer a partir da terça-feira da próxima semana, o que deverá coincidir com o dia da apreciação em plenário do Orçamento de 2018.

Aliado de Temer, o presidente do Congresso, senador Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE), agendou a sessão conjunta das duas Casas para a terça da próxima semana, o que deve garantir quórum elevado no Legislativo.

O presidente Michel Temer deverá se envolver pessoalmente na busca de apoios da base em favor do texto. O Planalto está otimista com a conquista de votos nos últimos dias, mas quer ter um quadro mais individualizado sobre os apoios de cada um dos partidos da base, segundo uma fonte. A cautela se justifica, uma vez que tem havido divergência dos apoios que o governo tem entre as próprias lideranças da base.

Em entrevista coletiva na manhã desta segunda, o deputado Carlos Marun (PMDB-MS), que assumirá na quinta-feira a Secretaria de Governo, manteve o cálculo do governo de que faltam ainda de 40 a 50 votos para alcançar uma margem de segurança para aprovar o texto --que precisa do apoio de ao menos 308 dos 513 deputados. Um dos vice-líderes do governo na Câmara, Beto Mansur (PRB-SP), contudo, disse que há cerca de 100 indecisos na base.

Após PMDB e PTB fecharem questão em favor da proposta, o PPS seguiu a mesma linha no fim de semana. Num aceno a Temer, o novo presidente do PSDB, o governador Geraldo Alckmin, disse ser pessoalmente a favor do fechamento de questão e vai ouvir os deputados da bancada esta semana para tomar uma decisão.

Mansur, conhecido pelas estimativas de votos com base em tabelas, acredita que novas movimentações políticas do fim de semana podem ter ajudado o quadro do governo. Ele citou a decisão do PPS e a atuação de Alckmin em favor da reforma.

“Lógico que ele (Alckmin) vai trabalhar, espero que isso aconteça, de ele trabalhar junto à bancada do PSDB. Eu vou ter surpresa se o PSDB não for no mesmo caminho que o candidato deles à Presidência da República”, afirmou.

A avaliação no Planalto, segundo uma fonte, é que Alckmin tem cumprido bem o papel de apoio à reforma, o que pode gerar um bom humor no restante da base. A expectativa de governistas é que o PP também feche questão --o partido indicou que deve se posicionar dessa forma se o texto for à votação.

EMENDAS

Durante o dia, Temer reuniu-se com os ministros do Planejamento, Dyogo Oliveira, da Integração Nacional, Helder Barbalho, e das Cidades, Alexandre Baldy, além de dois representantes do alto escalão do Ministério da Saúde.

Segundo a fonte palaciana, foi discutida uma ação dos ministérios em favor da garantia de liberação de recursos de emendas parlamentares para este ano e para o próximo. Essa é uma das armas comumente usadas por governos para conquistar votos dos parlamentares.

Em Buenos Aires no domingo, o presidente disse que a reforma vai “muito bem” e destacou acreditar que é “possível” aprová-la neste ano na Câmara, embora tenha admitido que a matéria poderá ficar para 2018.

“Eu suponho que talvez seja possível (votar neste ano), mas se não for, nós vamos encerrar a discussão ainda neste ano e esta matéria da Previdência não vai parar. Se não for neste ano, será no início do ano que vem”, disse o presidente.

Marun foi na mesma linha e afirmou que “vamos tentar votar agora, vamos conseguir”, mas ressaltou que caso isso não ocorra “vamos chegar aqui em fevereiro e esse vai ser o assunto”. O deputado insistiu, porém, que o governo está em busca dos votos que faltam para que a matéria seja aprovada agora.

A leitura afinada de Temer e Marun, segundo uma fonte do Planalto, é que os parlamentares terão de conviver com a pauta da reforma, se ela não for aprovada. Isto é, em vez de o governo estar “jogando a toalha”, ele estará colocando uma pressão permanente nos deputados. Entretanto, para Mansur, o governo teria menos votos se deixar a apreciação da matéria para 2018.

“Não há como você ficar agora fazendo conjectura que não dá para votar agora, vai votar em fevereiro. Na minha opinião, nós teremos menos votos em fevereiro do que teremos na semana que vem”, disse Mansur a jornalistas, acrescentando que o foco do governo é trabalhar para angariar os votos necessários e votar a proposta na próxima semana.

Em São Paulo, também nesta manhã, o presidente da Câmara reconheceu que não será “fácil” votar a proposta na próxima semana, mas que segue empenhado para isso.

While the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp has said foreign investment accounts for only about 10 percent of sales activity, policymakers and voters alike have seized on the issue has a driving force behind precarious markets in both cities.

Statistics Canada’s C$39.9 million, five-year project to better measure the market - using land registries and tax records, among other data - will kick off on Dec. 19 with the foreign investment data for Toronto and Vancouver, which together account for about 50 percent of home sales by value.

“It’s a good thing that this is coming, but it would have been better to have it years ago. Government policy has been reactive, whether they had evidence or not to base a reaction on,” said David Madani, senior economist with Capital Economics.

The most obvious example of policy made without proof of a need for it is the 15 percent foreign buyers’ tax, levied in Toronto and Vancouver in 2017 and 2016, respectively, by provincial governments under pressure to do something about soaring housing prices.

While the tax initially dampened sales in both Toronto and Vancouver, demand has came trickling back, confirming the conviction of those who said foreign buyers were never behind the housing boom.

“We assume it is foreign ownership ... increasing the price of housing, but is it true? The big questions are still there, we don’t know and until we get proper data, we are not quite sure,” said Anik Lacroix, an assistant director at Statistics Canada who is leading the project.

While the unknowns of foreign buyers is the highest-profile gap in the data, Lacroix hopes to tackle many others, including where buyers get their downpayments, how many homes are vacant, how much demand comes from investors and speculators and how much prices have actually been rising.

With much of the current data coming from the real estate industry, official data will help government and regulators better manage the market.

“You should be gentle, very, very gentle,” said Xiong, who performs traditional eyelid shaves at his roadside location in Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan.

Customers swear by the practice of “blade wash eyes”, as it is known in Mandarin, saying they trust Xiong’s skill with the blade.

“No, it’s not dangerous,” said 68-year-old Zhang Tian. “My eyes feel refreshed after shaving and I feel comfortable.”

Xiong, 62, said he learned the technique in the 1980s and serves up to eight customers a week, charging 80 yuan ($12) per shave.

“It was difficult at the beginning, but it became a piece of cake afterwards,” he said.

The technique appears to unblock moisturizing sebaceous glands along the rim of the eyelid, said Qu Chao, an opthalmologist who works at a nearby hospital in Chengdu.

“Patients will feel their eyes are dry and uncomfortable when the glands are blocked,” she said. “When he is shaving, it is most likely that he is shaving the openings of these glands.”

She said there was a risk of infection if the equipment was not sterilized.

“Adrian is pretty well known in markets,” said Michael Reddell, a former RBNZ official who served with Orr on its monetary policy committee in the 1990s.
In addition to his background both at the central bank and private banking, he is considered to have strong communication skills - a must for a central bank governor.

The new coalition government campaigned on a bid to make the economy work for its people, putting housing and employment at the heart of its political agenda.

As part of that, the government launched a review of the Reserve Bank Act to add maximising employment as a monetary policy goal alongside inflation - in a historic move for the first central bank ever to adopt an official inflation target.

Those plans, along with the finance minister’s comments that he wanted a governor that would adhere to the dual mandate, had sparked some worries that the central bank could lose its focus on inflation, analysts said.

The appointment of Orr, a former deputy governor who also worked as chief economist for the bank, appeased some of those concerns, pushing the New Zealand dollar to a two-week high.

“Adrian is pretty well known in markets,” said Michael Reddell, a former RBNZ official who served with Orr on its monetary policy committee in the 1990s.

“It’s not someone who’s totally flaky leftwing, because no one’s had a clear sense of who was in the running and it could have been someone out of left field who is more strongly perceived as highly dovish.”

The New Zealand dollar NZD=D4 hit $0.6930 late on Monday against the U.S. dollar, and remained close to those levels at around $0.6929 on Tuesday.

The currency, the world’s 11th most-traded, has fallen nearly 6 percent since the September election brought in a more protectionist Labour-led coalition in the first change of government for a decade.

“He’s perceived as fairly level headed,” said Stuart Ive, a Wellingon-based dealer at OM Financial.

“LARGER THAN LIFE”

Orr, who was RBNZ deputy governor for four years before joining the New Zealand Super Fund in 2007, will take over from Grant Spencer on March 27.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson said on Monday that the laws to change the bank’s mandate would likely not be in force by March, but the policy target agreement between him and Orr would be “developed in a manner consistent with the direction of reform.”

In November, Robertson told Reuters that willingness to focus on lifting employment, alongside inflation, would be key in accepting the RBNZ’s choice for the next governor.

“I’ve been assured by the chair of the board that Mr Orr is in a position to do that and that he will be able to manage a period of change well for the board and I’ve accepted those assurances,” Robertson told reporters on Monday.

In addition to his background both at the central bank and private banking, he is considered to have strong communication skills - a must for a central bank governor.

“He sometimes has got a very colourful turn of phrase, he uses metaphors in a way which sometimes (is) very memorable,” Don Brash, former RBNZ governor who overlapped at the bank with Orr, told Reuters. “He is a very good communicator.”

Reddell also praised his communication skills but said he could be too colourful for some people.

“He’s a larger than life character and whether you want governors that are larger than life, people will have different views on that,” Reddell added.",Markets relieved that 'well known' Orr will head NZ central bank,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-newzealand-cenbank-governor/markets-relieved-that-well-known-orr-will-head-nz-central-bank-idUKKBN1E507T?il=0

(Reuters) - Firefighters, taking advantage of a lull in the winds, on Monday held in check a massive Southern California wildfire that has torched hundreds of buildings and charred an area larger than New York City.

The Thomas Fire ignited a week ago and has burned 231,700 acres, in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, about 100 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) officials said at a news conference. It continued to grow on Monday, but at a slower pace, burning an additional several hundred acres.

The fire threatens 18,000 structures, including some in the wealthy enclave of Montecito where a number of celebrities have their homes.

Hot and dry Santa Ana winds, which blow from the deserts to the ocean, allowed the fire to explode in size last week. But gusts were light on Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Kathy Hoxsie said, even though the air was warm and dry.

The fire crept along ridge lines above Montecito and the city of Santa Barbara, and firefighters were bracing to keep it from coming downhill into those communities, officials said.

Most of the nearly 900 homes, outbuildings and businesses destroyed by the fire are in neighboring Ventura County, where the blaze first erupted.

Arthur Hurtz, 59, is among the local residents coming to terms with being homeless. He fled from his house in the city of Ventura overlooking the Pacific Ocean last week, just minutes before a wall of flames engulfed it, he said.

“It’s completely gone. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Hurtz, who is now staying at an emergency shelter.

The fire, in addition to destroying buildings, has damaged about 180 structures and ranks as the fifth-largest wildfire on record in California, according to Cal Fire.

The fire, for which investigators were still seeking to determine the cause, was 20 percent contained on Monday evening, up from 15 percent earlier in the day.

Public schools in Santa Barbara and some school systems nearby have canceled classes this week and will not reconvene until the annual winter break is completed in January, said Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider.

“Our house is under threat of being burned,” DeGeneres wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “We just had to evacuate our pets.”

A spokesman for DeGeneres declined to provide any other details on Monday.

Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground.

The Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were both at least 90 percent contained, officials said, while the Skirball Fire in the posh Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles was 85 percent contained.

North of San Diego, the 4,100-acre (1,660 hectare) Lilac Fire was also 90 percent contained on Monday, after destroying 151 structures.

“It came from a good place and I guess that’s why I‘m here.”","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand’s bowlers steadily chipped away at the West Indies lineup to record a ruthless 240-run victory shortly before tea on the fourth day of the second test at Seddon Park in Hamilton on Tuesday to wrap up a 2-0 series sweep.

Mitchell Santner took wickets on successive balls to end the tourists’ second innings on 203 for nine as they tried in vain to chase the 444 runs needed to secure an unlikely drawn series after New Zealand dominated the first test in Wellington.

The hosts did not need to take all 10 wickets after Sunil Ambris retired hurt when a short Neil Wagner delivery broke his arm, as the visitors resumed on 30-2 and were never really able to establish a solid partnership throughout the day.

“New Zealand did a great job but when we batted we didn’t produce, especially in the first innings of the first test,” stand-in West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said.

“Tough loss, but we saw on the bouncy pitches that we have to be better with our shot selection and we need to be more incisive.”

Trent Boult became the sixth New Zealander to claim 200 test wickets when he had Brathwaite caught in the gully by skipper Kane Williamson for 20 to leave the visitors floundering at 43-3 and they failed to recover from the early blow.

“It was great to put two strong performances on the board. Credit to the way we stuck to our plans and executed them well in both games,” Williamson told reporters.

“Both teams fought really hard but it was nice for us to stick to our plans for long periods and get the rewards.”

Boult was not the only New Zealander to achieve a significant personal milestone during the game with Ross Taylor joining former mentor Martin Crowe and Williamson on 17 test centuries, the most by a New Zealander, on Monday.

Taylor finished on 107 not out when Williamson declared on 291-8 with about an hour’s play remaining on the third day.

Crowe, who died in 2016, has had a major impact on Taylor’s career, helping him transform from a swashbuckling, and at times impetuous, batsman into a player able to dominate attacks.

“At the start of my career if you’d told me I’d get 17 test hundreds, I’ve had said ‘no chance’,” Taylor told reporters after the milestone.

”I always thought I’d be just a white-ball player.

Trade officials from the two countries and the EU will make a joint statement on the sidelines of the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, aligning to address the overcapacity issue, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks on the issue were continuing.

It was unclear whether China would be specifically named in the statement.

Washington, Brussels and Tokyo have raised complaints about China’s subsidies to state-owned enterprises, state financing and investment rules that often force foreign firms to transfer strategic technologies. They argue that such distortions have fueled rampant overcapacity in key industries such as steel and aluminum that are flooding global markets and forcing layoffs elsewhere.

The United States has sided with the EU in arguing that the WTO should not grant China market economy status, a move that would severely weaken Western trade defenses.

On Monday, Japanese Trade and Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko voiced support for efforts to strengthen WTO transparency and reporting standards - a U.S. initiative largely aimed at exposing illegal Chinese subsidies.

“Free trade only works when we secure fair conditions for competition,” Seko said in remarks to WTO colleagues. “Fair market conditions must not be negatively affected by measures such as market-distorting subsidies, forced technology transfer, infringement of intellectual property rights and unfair trade practices by state-owned enterprises.”

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in remarks to colleagues, said some members were “intentionally circumventing” their obligations and seeking unfair concessions through litigation, causing the WTO to lose its trade negotiation focus.

The Financial Times reported that the joint statement would also target China’s intellectual property practices, including requirements that require firms turn technology over to local joint-venture partners.

Belgian striker Benteke went rogue and took the stoppage- time penalty against Bournemouth with the game locked at 2-2, even though Luka Milivojevic was the designated taker.

Benteke’s weak spot-kick was saved by Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic and Palace had to settle for a point which dropped them back to the foot of the table.

“If I had still been playing for CPFC I would have broken Benteke’s nose after in the dressing-room,” John Burridge, who kept goal for Palace from 1978-80, said on Twitter.

After the game Hodgson admitted Benteke’s miss could “cost his side in May” but with a home clash looming against Watford on Tuesday the 70-year-old was more philosophical.

“Christian was very confident, he had played well and he believed he was going to score that penalty,” Hodgson said on Monday.

”He persuaded Luka to let him take it. He wanted it and felt good, but unfortunately it didn’t work out.

“No guarantee Luka would’ve scored it either, of course.”

It was disappointing because when you have a penalty in the last minute you see a victory looming,” he added.

Palace captain Scott Dann also offered support to Benteke, despite the fact that Milivojevic had scored from the penalty spot earlier in the game.

“It takes a lot of courage to go up and take a penalty in the last couple of minutes,” he said.

“Unfortunately he’s missed - but we had so many other chances to win this game.”

Hodgson’s side have drawn four and won one of their last five Premier League games and with the three sides immediately above them all facing tough fixtures this week, Palace have another chance to climb out of the bottom three.

“One or two of our recent draws have felt like victories and Saturday’s like a defeat,” Hodgson said.

“Sometimes we get more than we deserve, sometimes less. We’re five unbeaten and I‘m happy with the five performances.”",Soccer-Hodgson smoothes over Benteke penalty miss,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1E51S9-OZASP

Africa’s fastest growing economy in 2016, Ivory Coast was hit earlier this year by successive uprisings by low-ranking troops. The costly bonuses paid to end the unrest helped balloon the budget deficit this year, and the episode tarnished its image as one of the continent’s rising economic stars.

The government said last week that it would retire around 1,000 soldiers by the end of the year as part of efforts to bring the force - estimated at about 25,000 troops - in line with “accepted standards”.

A spokesman did not say last week how much the soldiers would receive under the voluntary scheme. However, a document obtained by Reuters outlining the plan stated that each retired soldier would receive a payment of 15 million CFA francs.

Neither the spokesman nor Ivory Coast’s defense minister were available to comment on Monday.

Diplomats said the move signaled that the government was beginning to implement a military reform law. According to a copy of the law seen by Reuters, 4,400 troops are to leave the army over four years.

It was not immediately clear if that figure includes soldiers already scheduled to retire during the period.

Ivory Coast’s army was thrown together from rival loyalist and rebel factions at the end of a 2011 civil war that brought President Alassane Ouattara to power after his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo rejected his defeat in a 2010 run-off election.

It remains plagued by internal divisions. Diplomats and analysts say the force is bloated with unqualified personnel and vulnerable to political manipulation.

An adviser to Parliament Speaker Guillaume Soro, considered a leading candidate to replace term-limited President Ouattara in 2020, was arrested in October after a secret arms cache at his home helped mutinying soldiers halt a loyalist advance.

Soro and his supporters say the charges were politically motivated.

Am Sonntagabend gab ein Terminkontrakt auf die Cyber-Devise sein Debüt an der Chicagoer CBOE, einer der weltgrößten Derivatebörsen.

Ähnliche Papiere der Rivalen CME und Nasdaq, mit denen Investoren auf steigende und fallende Kurse setzen können, stehen bereits in den Startlöchern. Damit etabliert sich die bislang unregulierte Währung immer mehr. Der Kurs des CBOE-Futures schoss in den ersten Handelsstunden zeitweise um knapp 22 Prozent auf 18.850 Dollar in die Höhe.

“Die ersten Türen für den Mainstream sind offiziell eröffnet”, sagte Timo Emden, Deutschland-Chef des Online-Brokers DailyFX. Mati Greenspan, Marktanalyst des Online-Handelshauses eToro, sprach von einem überraschend starken Debüt. “Zudem sind Leerverkäufe weitgehend ausgeblieben, was den gesamten Kryptomarkt positiv stimmte und die Preise sowohl für Bitcoin als auch für einige andere Währungen in Richtung neuer Allzeithochs trieb.” Bitcoin gewann gut neun Prozent und blieb mit 17.030 Dollar etwa 120 Dollar unter dem Rekordhoch vom Freitag. Mit Leerverkäufen wetten Anleger auf fallende Kurse.

Für den Marktanalysten Milan Cutkovic vom Brokerhaus AxiTrader hat Bitcoin noch Luft nach oben: “Man muss kurzfristig zwar mit weiteren Flash-Crashs rechnen, aber die Kryptowährung dürfte bis zum Jahresende die Marke von 20.000 US-Dollar erreichen.” Zweistellige prozentuale Kursstürze binnen weniger Minuten sind bei Bitcoin keine Seltenheit. Am Montag lag die Schwankungsbreite bei rund 3000 Dollar. “Der Kurs wurde zum Spielball und somit zum Opfer von Arbitrage-Jägern, welche die massiven Preisunterschiede auf weltweiten Cyberbörsen ausnutzten”, erklärte DailyFX-Experte Emden. Auch Grant Spencer, Chef der neuseeländischen Zentralbank, äußerte sich kritisch: “Im Laufe der Jahrhunderte haben wir Spekulationsblasen gesehen, und das hier scheint ein klassischer Fall zu sein.”

BITCOIN IN DER PROBEZEIT

Hinter Bitcoin stehen weder Regierungen noch Zentralbanken. Über den Preis entscheiden allein Angebot und Nachfrage. Vor allem die Aussicht auf die Einführung von Futures hat der virtuellen Währung seit Jahresbeginn ein Kursplus von 1700 Prozent beschert. Am Sonntagabend (MEZ) feierte der CBOE-Terminkontrakt seinen Einstand. In einer Woche folgt das Papier der Lokalrivalin CME. Mit den Futures können Investoren auf den Kursverlauf wetten, ohne Bitcoin tatsächlich halten zu müssen.

Dem Hype der vergangenen Wochen zum Trotz hielten sich die Handelsumsätze an der CBOE Börsianern zufolge allerdings in Grenzen. “Die wenigsten Händler haben bislang Zugang zu diesem Future”, sagte einer von ihnen. Der “Financial Times” zufolge wollen einige Großbanken vorerst keine Kundenaufträge für den Handel mit Bitcoin-Futures annehmen. Auch die Online-Broker Charles Schwab und TD Ameritrade halten sich noch zurück. Für Ophir Gottlieb, den Chef des Anlageberaters Capital Market Laboratories, ist es aber nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis Profi-Anleger in großem Stil in den Markt einsteigen. Sie wollten zunächst abwarten, ob der Handel sauber ablaufe.

NEUE ANLAGEKLASSE ODER NEUE SPEKULATIONSBLASE?

Bitcoin wurde von einer Person oder Gruppe mit dem Pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto entwickelt und 2009 vorgestellt. Unter dem Eindruck der Finanzkrise von 2008 sollte eine weltweit jederzeit verfügbare unabhängige Währung geschaffen werden. Ihr Herzstück ist die sogenannte Blockchain, in der alle Transaktionen fälschungssicher gespeichert werden. Fans der Cyber-Devise hoffen darauf, dass Bitcoin langfristig Gold den Rang als “Antikrisen-Währung” streitig machen kann.

In Japan ist Bitcoin bereits gesetzliches Zahlungsmittel. Würden alle wirtschaftlichen Transaktionen in den sieben größten Industriestaaten der Welt künftig über die Cyberwährung abgewickelt, müsse ihr Wert theoretisch auf 220.000 Dollar steigen, rechnete Commerzbank-Chefvolkswirt Jörg Krämer vor. Dem werde der Staat aber sicher einen Riegel vorschieben. “Schließlich hat er ein großes Interesse, sein Geldsystem aufrechtzuerhalten.”

Die Behörden sind bereits hellhörig: Der österreichische Notenbank-Chef Ewald Nowotny plädierte für eine rasche Regulierung des bislang weitgehend freien Marktes für virtuelle Währungen. “Es wäre etwas eigenartig, hier quasi große Transaktionsvolumen völlig außer acht zu lassen.” Auch Südkorea denkt über neue Gesetze nach. Die CBOE-Papiere werden im vergleichsweise schwach regulierten OTC-Geschäft gehandelt. Vor diesem Hintergrund und wegen der starken Kursausschläge des Bitcoin-Kurses verlangt die Derivatebörse von Investoren eine Sicherheitsleistung (“Margin”) von 30 Prozent des Kontraktvolumens.[L8N1OB1GV] Bei den CME-Titeln werden sogar 35 Prozent vorab fällig.

“He’s come with us, but for sure after three or four days with a fever, his physical condition is not at the top level,” Conte said on Chelsea’s website (www.chelseafc.com).

“David Luiz is continuing to recover from his knee problem. And Morata is out. He is a bit tired and he has a problem in his back,” Conte added of the Spaniard, who has 10 goals this season.

The Italian, whose team won the title last season without the demands of European football, were drawn on Monday to face Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 stage.

“I think we have to face the reality and will try to do our best,” said Conte, whose players are already tired having featured in a pre-season tour of Asia before the season began.

”If I stay here to complain it is not the right way.

“For sure it is difficult because to face a game every three days is not simple, especially if your squad is not big, but at the same time we have to face this situation,” he was quoted as saying by The Independent.

“We have to try to do our best. For sure some players can be tired, that’s normal because some players are playing from this summer and our tours in China and Singapore.”

Conte is struggling to get consistent results in the Premier League this term and his third-placed side are 14 points adrift of leaders Manchester City after 16 games.

Huddersfield have won three of their last four games at the John Smith’s Stadium, with Manchester City only securing a 2-1 win with a late goal, and Conte expects a tough test.

LiAngelo Ball, who left UCLA earlier this month without ever playing a game, and LaMelo Ball, who withdrew from high school in his junior season, signed one-year deals to play with the Lithuanian club Vytautas Prienai, multiple media outlets reported.

The reported signings come days after Lavar Ball told ESPN that his two sons signed with an agent -- Harrison Gaines of Slash Sports Entertainment -- to work out a deal to play abroad.

The younger brothers of Los Angeles Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo, 19, and LaMelo, 16, will join Vytautas in January, Yahoo Sports reported, citing sources.

ESPN reported that the team and the Ball family were involved in negotiations Monday before finalizing an agreement later in the day.

Vytautas fields teams in both the Lithuanian and Baltic leagues, with the latter the lesser competitive of the two circuits. The Ball brothers are expected to play in the Baltic League.

“I don’t care about the money,” LaVar Ball said Thursday when explaining why his sons signed with an agent. “I want them to go somewhere where they will play them together on the court at the same time. The priority is for the boys to play on the same team.”

Gaines told Yahoo Sports that he was engaged in talks with a number of clubs, but said it made the most sense to sign with Vytautas.

“It was critical to find a situation in a competitive league that works with both of their short- and long-term goals,” Gaines told the website.

LaVar Ball pulled LiAngelo from UCLA earlier this month, telling ESPN that he was frustrated that the school hadn’t made a determination on the length of his son’s suspension following an arrest for shoplifting while in China last month.

LiAngelo Ball and fellow freshmen basketball players Cody Riley and Jalen Hill created an international incident that eventually involved President Donald Trump. While visiting Beijing as part of a five-nation Asia tour, Trump personally asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help resolve the case.

>> A new chapter for Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time. Bitcoin futures jumped over 20% before easing back. The surge may have caused an early outage at the Chicago-based CBOE Global Markets website. Reuters' Jemima Kelly says these aren't the first Bitcoin futures we've seen.

>> The point about this is that these are futures offered by one of the world's biggest derivatives exchanges on a completely regulated exchange. And they're cash-settled as well, which is important. Because that means that Investors who want exposure to BitCoin don't actually have to hold the cryptocurrency itself and all the risks that might come with that.

>> Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date. Backers hope an exchange listed, regulated product will encourage wider use and legitimacy, making it easier for mainstream investors to bet on BitCoin's rise or fall. In the lead up, the value of BitCoin surged.

It's boasted a gravity-defying 15-fold gain since the start of the year, with one coin now worth around $16,000. One month future contracts are trading at about a 10% premium to that.>> Which indicates that investors still feel like there is more of this rally to go, despite lots of warnings that this massive bubble that's gonna bust.",Hotly anticipated bitcoin futures surge on debut,https://www.reuters.tv/v/Jsn/2017/12/11/hotly-anticipated-bitcoin-futures-surge-on-debut

The ads are yet another sign of just how overtly Moscow and its outlets have been reveling in their newfound reputation for driving events in Western politics. But it also points to a growing and increasingly difficult dynamic. As the United States, Britain and other European nations obsess ever more deeply about potential Russian interference within their borders, they ironically risk playing further into the Kremlin’s hands.

President Donald Trump might remain unconvinced, but outside the White House there remains little doubt that President Vladimir Putin’s government has deliberately attempted to drive political events in Europe and the United States. U.S. intelligence agencies are united in their conclusion that Moscow interfered directly during the 2016 presidential election, primarily through hacking Democratic Party e-mails and disseminating their content to discredit Hillary Clinton.

In Europe the evidence is even more widespread. The European Union’s counter-disinformation campaign “EU Disinfo” says it has tracked more than 1,300 examples of pro-Kremlin interference this year. Moscow’s hand is seen as trying to drive support for the far right across the continent as well as a host of disparate causes like Brexit and independence for Catalonia.

Particularly in its most recent campaigns, social media analysts believe Russia has been using an army of automated social media feeds, dubbed “bots,” to get its message across. But it also has more traditional media arms such as the website “Sputnik” and the RT network.

Both Sputnik and RT have their own considerable web presence. Google last month announced it would “derank” both to give them less prominence on Google News and other platforms. Their stories, however, continue to be widely spread on other social media.

Even directly Russian government-linked social media outlets such as the Russian embassy Twitter feed in London have been openly “trolling” western governments and institutions, mocking them with jokes and sometimes ungrammatical rants.

None of this behavior is entirely new – but it hasdoes appear to have increased substantially in the last two years. Ever since Russia annexed Crimea and began a wider war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, a growing number of Western analysts have believed that Putin is deliberately doing whatever he can generate discord and chaos within the West.

Even more than the intensity of Russia’s activity, the level of attention now paid to it has increased. Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May recently devoted an entire speech to the topic, saying such actions “threaten the international order.”

In the United States, meanwhile, the focus is on the potentially paralyzing consequences of prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probe of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow – particularly now that former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn has cut a deal to cooperate with the inquiry after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador last December.

There is clearly a difficult balance here. Many in the West, particularly former members of the Obama administration, feel they were caught out by the scale and intent of Russian activity, especially during the 2016 U.S. election.

The risk, however, is that the level of attention now being devoted to Russian hacking, manipulation of social media and other questionable political activities furthers Putin’s goal of delegitimizing Western governments while boosting Russia’s reputation for being able to call the shots.

For all the evidence of Russian activity, we may never know to what extent Moscow truly affected the outcomes of any of the political contests in which it dabbled. We know that a pro-Kremlin institution bought ads on Facebook to provoke partisanship in the United States. We know that significant numbers of American voters went online to search for the hacked political emails Russia apparently gave to Wikileaks. But, as analyst Nate Silver notes, “there just isn’t a clean-cut story in the data.”

On the surface, the volume of potential Russian interference on social media can seem massive. According to one estimate, Russian-related Twitter feeds were responsible for more than 1.5 million election-related tweets during the 2016 campaign. However, compared to the sheer volume of other election-related material published during the campaign, the Russian contribution is unlikely to have been the only factor.

The same is true when it comes to the rise of Europe’s far right. There’s no doubt that Russia has pushed some very divisive storylines, including around the alleged rape of a 13-year-old Russian-speaking girl in Germany by Arab migrants – an incident authorities say was later proven never to have happened. Those who monitor far-right chat rooms closely, however, say that Russia -related content remains only a very small proportion of the traffic. Most simply remains homegrown, according to a report by the UK’s Royal Institute of International Affairs.

That doesn’t mean Russian involvement isn’t real. But by focusing on it to the exclusion of other variables, political establishments in Europe and the U.S. all too often give the impression of looking for scapegoats. That may paradoxically reduce the prospects of addressing reasons for the underlying political issues that led to dissatisfied Britons voting to leave the European Union and disaffected U.S. citizens voting for a polarizing candidate like Trump.

In the UK, those issues included frustration at the mainstream political establishment over multiple issues, immigration in particular. In the United States Trump’s rise too was partly because he was able to tap into the alienation and frustration of those who’d lost their jobs to workers in other countries.

Russia clearly did what it could to exploit those feelings and trends, but it did not create them. Politicians need to find ways to address their concerns and reduce political polarization, not look for excuses about why voters turned against them.

That is obviously easier said than done – every Western government has been desperately searching for policy solutions since the 2008 financial crisis, with often relatively little to show for it. But that doesn’t mean it’s not vital that policymakers continue to try. The Kremlin’s narrative is aimed not just at undermining individual governments and institutions, but the entire idea of Western democracy itself.

The West needs to be alert to Russian meddling, and giving people the information they need to detect it is important. But if the West is tempted to make Moscow take the blame for all its ills, it will end up furthering the Kremlin’s strategy more than Putin might ever have hoped.",Commentary: Blame Russia.

The deal gives the Swiss insurer the top spot in a market attractive to global players due to its robust economy and low penetration, while helping Australia’s No. 4 lender move ahead with a long-planned exit from non-core operations.

Zurich, Europe’s fifth-biggest insurer, also bought Macquarie Group Ltd’s (MQG.AX) life insurance unit for an undisclosed sum in 2016 and the Cover-More Group for $554 million in April. Together with its purchase of ANZ’s OnePath, it will now command 19 percent of Australia’s retail life insurance market.

As part of the agreement, it will also gain access to ANZ’s six million customers through a 20 year distribution agreement to sell life insurance.

The deal “provides a highly cash-generative business that will add to our cash remittances....and support dividend growth beyond that implied by our existing plan”, Zurich Chief Executive Mario Greco said in a statement.

It will increase cash flows by around $225 million over the 2017-2019 planning period, Zurich said, adding that the deal would be paid for with existing cash and senior debt.

The acquisition is the largest since Greco took over at Zurich last year. Brought in from Italy’s Generali (GASI.MI) to engineer a turnaround for the troubled group, Greco has promised to make Zurich leaner and more efficient.

ANZ’s sale comes amid a rush of divestments by Australia’s biggest banks, under pressure from more stringent capital requirements to slim down.

Banks are also seeking to get back to basics after a series of governance scandals, including one where Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) was accused of using outdated medical definitions to refuse life insurance payouts that resulted in a backlash against the whole sector.

“These non-core assets are causing a lot of core headaches,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer of Atlas Funds Management, which holds ANZ shares.

“What they’re concerned about is a bleeding over into their loan book.”

In September, Australia’s biggest lender Commonwealth Bank sold its life insurance unit to Hong Kong-based AIA (1299.HK) for $3.1 billion, while No. 3 lender National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) sold 80 percent of its life insurance unit to Japan’s Nippon Life Insurance last year.

ANZ Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliot said in a statement the bank’s strategy was to “do a few things and do them incredibly well” and that “we are just exiting, shrinking or partnering on everything else”.

The bank sold its pension business in October to Australian pension manager IOOF Holdings (IFL.AX) for A$975 million.

ANZ said it would book an extraordinary loss of about A$520 million from the sale of the life insurance business.

Group-IB warned that the attacks, which began 18 months ago and allow money to be stolen from banks’ automated teller machines (ATMs), appear to be ongoing and that banks in Latin America could be targeted next.

The first attack occurred in the spring of 2016 against banks in First Data’s (FDC.N) “STAR” network, the largest U.S. bank messaging system connecting ATMs at more than 5,000 organizations, Group-IB researchers said in a 36-page report.

In a statement, First Data said that a number of small financial institutions operating on the STAR network had had their credentials breached for administering debit cards earlier in 2016, leading First Data to implement new mandatory security controls. It said the STAR network was never itself breached.

The firm said it was continuing to investigate a number of incidents where hackers studied how to make money transfers through the SWIFT banking system, while stopping short of saying whether any such attacks had been carried out successfully.

SWIFT said in October that hackers were still targeting its interbank messaging system, but security controls instituted after last year’s $81 million heist at Bangladesh’s central bank had thwarted many of those attempts. (reut.rs/2z1b7Bo)

Group-IB has dubbed the hacker group “MoneyTaker” after the name of software it used to hijack payment orders to then cash out funds through a network of low-level “money mules” who were hired to pick up money from automated teller machines.

The security researchers said they had identified 18 banks who were hit including 15 across 10 states in the United States, two in Russia and one in Britain. Beside banks, financial software firms and one law firm were targeted.

The average amount of money stolen in each of 14 U.S. ATM heists was $500,000 per incident. Losses in Russia averaged $1.2 million per incident, but one bank there managed to catch the attack and return some of the stolen funds, Group-IB said.

Hackers also stole documentation for OceanSystems’ Fed Link transfer system used by 200 banks in Latin America and the United States, it said. In addition, they successfully attacked the Russian interbank messaging system known as AW CRB.

Once hackers penetrated targeted banks and financial organizations, they stole internal bank documentation in order to mount future ATM attacks, Group-IB said. In Russia, the hackers continued to spy on bank networks after break-ins, while at least one U.S. bank had documents robbed twice, it said.

Group-IB said it had notified Interpol and Europol in order to assist in law enforcement investigations.

The unidentified hackers used a mix of constantly changing tools and tactics to bypass anti-virus and other traditional security software while being careful to eliminate traces of their operations, helping them to go largely unnoticed. To disguise their moves, hackers used security certificates from brands such as Bank of America, the Fed, Microsoft and Yahoo.","Hackers hit U.S., Russian banks in ATM robbery scam: report",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-banks-atm/hackers-hit-u-s-russian-banks-in-atm-robbery-scam-report-idUSKBN1E51SZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The company’s shares, the best-performing Dow component this year with an 84 percent surge, were up 1.2 percent at $286.51 in after-market trading.

The world’s biggest maker of jetliners said the raised dividend and the new buyback program were not in response to a Republican tax overhaul, which seeks to cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent.

Other U.S. corporations have said they would use the windfall from the tax overhaul to buy back shares, retire debt and other shareholder-friendly moves.

England need to at least draw the test in Perth to stay alive in the five-match series after they lost the first game in Brisbane by 10 wickets and the second in Adelaide by 120 runs.

Off-the field incidents over the last few months, however, have also dogged the team and blighted the team’s image.

Already missing all-rounder Ben Stokes pending the outcome of a police investigation into an incident in Bristol in September, Bairstow was accused of ‘headbutting’ Australia’s Cameron Bancroft in a Perth bar early in the tour.

Ben Duckett, who was part of the England Lions side also in Australia, was then stood down after he poured a drink over a team mate -- reported to be bowler James Anderson -- in the same Perth bar ahead of a warmup game before the third test.

“There are things that have been blown up,” the wicketkeeper told British media ahead of the third test.

”That is part and parcel of it and we need to rebuild the trust we have built over the last few years as a team.

The suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, was taken to a hospital after suffering burns from the explosive device, which was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties and did not fully ignite, officials said. Investigators told Reuters they believe the attack in midtown Manhattan was intended to be a suicide bombing.

The blast, which occurred around 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) in a busy underground passageway between the subway station underneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square subway station, sent commuters fleeing for the exits and police officers rushing to the scene, as officials scrambled to reroute trains and shut down streets.

Three people, including a police officer, suffered minor injuries.

The attack came just six weeks after police say an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians along a bike path in lower Manhattan, killing eight in an act for which Islamic State later claimed responsibility. In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood.

In recent years, numerous people claiming to be inspired by Islamic State have carried out attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States.

A law enforcement official familiar with the Ullah investigation said investigators have found evidence that he watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet.

‘AMATEUR-LEVEL’

The weapon used in Monday’s attack was “amateur-level,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference near the explosion site. He told CNN the homemade bomb may not have fully ignited, possibly limiting the damage.

Officials said the attempted bombing underscored New York City’s status as a target for such attacks, citing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people in all, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.

“Let’s be clear, as New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. “And let’s also be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack.”

In a statement, President Donald Trump said the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.

“America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,” he said.

The president also criticized the visa program that allowed Ullah to enter the United States in 2011 because he had family members already in the country, saying such family visas are “incompatible with national security.”

Ullah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, said Shameem Ahsan, consul general of Bangladesh in New York.

Authorities did not immediately comment on Ullah’s motives. When asked whether Ullah had claimed any connection to Islamic State, New York Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said, “He did make statements but we’re not going to talk about that right now.”

Several U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no immediate information indicating Ullah was previously known to any American spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militants or terrorism, though a connection could still be found.

Ullah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country’s police chief. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.

Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver’s license from 2012 to 2015, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.

Monday’s incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in a long tunnel that connects sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso.

‘EVERYBODY WAS SCARED’

The explosion turned a normal start to the work week into a chaotic scene.

“There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,” said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. “Everybody was scared and running and shouting.”

The bus terminal was temporarily closed, and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway travel was disrupted but later returned to normal.

In December, New York experiences a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store window displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows.

More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city’s busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Ten train lines stop at the station.

The bus terminal is the busiest in the United States, according to the Port Authority. On a typical weekday, about 220,000 passengers arrive or depart on more than 7,000 buses.

The bus terminal is adjacent to and above the subway station’s western section. A long, narrow underground tunnel connects that part of the station to its eastern section, and is used by thousands of commuters during rush hour.

The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening stock markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries.

Technology and energy stocks closed higher Monday, helping Wall Street shake off uncertainties following the explosion.","Subway bomber wounds self, three victims in New York",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-newyork-incident/subway-bomber-wounds-self-three-victims-in-new-york-idUKKBN1E51EI

Trade officials from the two countries and the EU will make a joint statement on the sidelines of the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, aligning to address the overcapacity issue, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks on the issue were continuing.

It was unclear whether China would be specifically named in the statement.

Washington, Brussels and Tokyo have raised complaints about China’s subsidies to state-owned enterprises, state financing and investment rules that often force foreign firms to transfer strategic technologies. They argue that such distortions have fueled rampant overcapacity in key industries such as steel and aluminum that are flooding global markets and forcing layoffs elsewhere.

The United States has sided with the EU in arguing that the WTO should not grant China market economy status, a move that would severely weaken Western trade defenses.

On Monday, Japanese Trade and Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko voiced support for efforts to strengthen WTO transparency and reporting standards - a U.S. initiative largely aimed at exposing illegal Chinese subsidies.

“Free trade only works when we secure fair conditions for competition,” Seko said in remarks to WTO colleagues. “Fair market conditions must not be negatively affected by measures such as market-distorting subsidies, forced technology transfer, infringement of intellectual property rights and unfair trade practices by state-owned enterprises.”

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in remarks to colleagues, said some members were “intentionally circumventing” their obligations and seeking unfair concessions through litigation, causing the WTO to lose its trade negotiation focus.

The Financial Times reported that the joint statement would also target China’s intellectual property practices, including requirements that require firms turn technology over to local joint-venture partners.

The concession, designed to head off a potential rebellion in parliament, will be incorporated into the EU withdrawal bill - the legislation that forms a central plank of May’s Brexit strategy.

Several lawmakers, including members of the governing Conservative Party, have challenged her administration over its plans to copy and paste EU rules into British legislation, saying they give ministers power to change laws without the agreement of parliament.

To address these concerns, a committee of lawmakers has proposed adding an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny of such changes.

“We have studied the Procedure Committee’s report in detail and listened to the representations, and we are announcing today that we will be accepting this amendment,” the spokesman told reporters.

The plan is to create a ‘sifting committee’ to look at each of the proposed changes as they are published by the government and recommend how they are then approved by parliament. Although all changes will receive parliamentary approval, some can be recommended for more detailed scrutiny.

The transfer of EU law into British law is designed to give businesses legal certainty after Britain’s departure in March 2019. Parliament has described is as one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content.

On Monday, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts under the new rules. The agencies said the proposal will “return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs.”

Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “will work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”

Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block, throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said the agreement “is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.”

The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. ”The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said “FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact -- many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed.”

Chris Lewis, vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC is “joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public. This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you.”

Democrats and net neutrality advocates plan a series of protests ahead of Thursday’s vote. Pai’s proposal has already won the backing of the three Republicans on the five-member commission. The reversal represents a victory for big internet providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that opposed the 2015 rules.

Pai’s proposal is opposed by large internet companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).

Por meio da conta do ministério no Twitter, o ministro disse ainda que a dívida pública pode chegar a 100 por cento do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) em 2021. Em outubro, a relação da dívida bruta com o PIB atingiu 74,4 por cento, de acordo com o Banco Central.

O governo do presidente Michel Temer tem enfrentado dificuldades para conquistar apoio político à reforma da Previdência, considerada essencial para colocar as contas públicas em ordem. Além de liberar recursos para emendas parlamentares, Temer também mexeu no primeiro escalão ao indicar o deputado Carlos Marun (PMDB-MS) como ministro da Secretaria de Governo e agradar sobretudo os parlamentares do centrão.

“No Norte e Nordeste, a proporção de trabalhadores que já se aposenta por idade é superior a 85 por cento.”

Oliveira disse ainda que as regras para os trabalhadores rurais não vão mudar, bem como o tempo mínimo de contribuição para os trabalhadores do setor privado se aposentarem, permanecendo em 15 anos.","Brasil não terá credibilidade para se financiar sem reforma da Previdência, diz ministro do Planejamento",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1E51MQ-OBRBS

“Two of America’s worst mass shootings (Las Vegas concert/ Texas church) have happened on your watch,” she might have tweeted back. “Shouldn’t POTUS focus on gun laws?” She didn’t do that, of course.

Probably. Education Secretary Justine Greening told the BBC that while she didn’t agree with Trump’s tweets she “did not believe it should detract from the close relationship the U.K. has had for many, many years and will go on to have with America and the American people.”

In the short term, however, the relationship will tremble. As will Theresa May, for she more than any other Western leader sought a demonstrative friendship with Trump, who held her hand in the White House rose garden. For May, a trade deal with the United States is a necessity after/if Brexit takes the U.K. out of the European Union’s single market.

There is a greater dependence than usual on the U.K. side of the relationship, one of which Trump – with his self-vaunted expertise in deal making – will be well aware. And the prime minister will have been aware that he is aware. Nonetheless, she still issued a public rebuke – a sign of her disgust, of her realization that the British establishment and most of its population would share her disgust and that she sees some things as too important to remain silent.

Yet if Britain is dependent – as all European states are on the U.S. military umbrella, among much else – so is America dependent on Britain. The “special relationship” is more treasured by British politicians than most American ones, but it still matters, especially when Washington seeks allies in controversial projects like the Iraq invasion. For Trump to prioritize the desire to hit back at a British prime minister over the threat of damage to that relationship is to reveal the terrible shallowness of the president’s grasp of international relationships, and to rouse yet again fears that his unpredictability and narcissism threatens us all.

If any good came of the latest fine mess the president has got the presidency into, it is that it has, for at least a day, brought the fractured and fractious British politics together behind Prime Minister May. Sadiq Khan, the Labour (and Muslim) mayor of London, himself a target of Trump’s earlier tweets, said that the president’s comments were “a betrayal of the special relationship.” The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, showed a tender care for Queen Elizabeth not usual for one on the left of the Labour Party, lamenting that Trump had put the monarch into a “difficult and invidious position” since the invitation for a state visit, which still stands, is officially issued under the Queen’s name.

Is it possible that Trump’s straight-from-the-shoulder style is simply unbearable to the British, perceived by many Americans (and others) as being snobbish and repressed? Certainly, some of Trump’s right-wing supporters appreciate his bluntness about Islamic extremists. “That’s not news,” Mark Krikorian, a supporter of the president and executive director of the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies told the New York Times of Trump’s Twitter sharing. Trump “just expresses that stuff in the most unfiltered, guy-ranting-in-the-bar” way.

It isn’t that. Trump’s “style,” in this context, is directly and repeatedly anti-Muslim. He has sought and still seeks to stop Muslims coming to the United States. He said, falsely, that thousands of people in New Jersey – “a heavy Arab population” – had been shown on TV cheering after the planes destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 9/11. The unverified videos he re-tweeted this week came from the Britain First group, not just far-right but dedicated to stirring up violent action against Muslims; its deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, herself faces several charges of harassment of Muslims.

Compare Trump’s response with his recent predecessors. George W. Bush had to bear the shock of the 2001 attacks as a newish president, but took some care in his reaction to the horror to tell Muslims that he respected the “good and peaceful” teachings of Islam and that America’s enemy was “a radical network of terrorists,” not “our many Muslim friends.” Barack Obama continued that tradition.

In the U.K., as in other Western democracies, that distinction – between the large majority of peaceful citizens of Muslim faith and the few deadly, militant Islamists among their number – is maintained. How else could a civil society be retained if thousands, in some countries millions, of citizens and would-be citizens were demonized and made the butt of violent prejudice?

Trump’s behavior this week shows how little he understands this. Washington and Westminster may continue their close alliance, but the president should not see his decision to give publicity to a semi-fascist group’s efforts to sow violent hatred – then capping that with the need to humiliate a close ally – as a good day’s work.",Commentary: Will Trump’s anti-Muslim retweets destroy U.S.-U.K. special relationship?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-retweets-commentary/commentary-will-trumps-anti-muslim-retweets-destroy-u-s-u-k-special-relationship-idUSKBN1DV5U5

Shares in Steinhoff fell by 80 percent last week after the international retail group, whose brands include Poundland and Mattress Firm, disclosed “accounting irregularities” and parted ways with veteran chief executive Markus Jooste.

The JSE said in a statement it was investigating whether there had been any breaches of its listing requirements, adding this included “any breaches in relation to previous financial disclosures made to the public by Steinhoff International”.

Steinhoff (SNHJ.J) has a secondary listing on the bourse, which is also reviewing trading in its shares ahead of last week’s announcements, which included the company delaying its earnings report.

Two days before Steinhoff’s initial announcement, trading volumes in its shares jumped to between 27 and 32 million. This was the highest since Sept. 22 when the company said it expected a Dutch court to throw out a petition by its former joint venture partner to order a probe into the company’s accounts.

SHARE BOUNCE

Steinhoff’s shares rose by as much as 40 percent on Monday, regaining some ground after it called on its lenders to help.

It has also hired U.S. investment bank Moelis & Co (MC.N) and asked management consultancy AlixPartners “to assist on liquidity management and operational measures”.

“The group is asking for and requires continued support in relation to existing facilities from all its lenders to achieve an immediate stabilisation of the group’s financing,” it said.

The company has delayed its regular annual lenders’ meeting in London by a week to Dec. 19.

By 1313 GMT, the stock (SNHJ.J) was up 38 percent at 8.30 in Johannesburg, recouping around $700 million of the $14 billion of shareholder value wiped off since last Wednesday.

Steinhoff has its main listing in Frankfurt where its shares rose by more than 13 percent.

There was some buying off a low base, but most investors were waiting for more information, Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods said.

“On the positive side, it does look like Christo Wiese is doing a salvage job,” Woods said of the retail group’s biggest shareholder and chairman, who is now at the helm.

Wiese and former chief executive Jooste were instrumental in turning Steinhoff from a modest distributor of furniture made in communist era eastern Europe to a global household goods juggernaut, vying for market share with the likes of IKEA.

Steinhoff has been on shopping spree since 2011 when it took over French furniture retailer Conforama. Last year’s string of acquisitions thrust it firmly on to investors’ radar screens.

Productivity – output per hour worked – is the mainspring of economic growth. In the decade before the financial crisis of 2007-08 productivity was increasing in Britain by just over 2 percent a year, outpacing the average for the other economies of the G7. But since the crisis British performance has been dismal. Although productivity jumped in the third quarter of 2017, prolonged weakness means that it is barely higher than its pre-crisis peak a decade ago. The recovery in GDP has been driven overwhelmingly by more labor input, a source of growth that is running dry – not least since the vote to leave the European Union delivered a message to curb immigration.

Other advanced economies have also experienced setbacks to productivity growth following the financial crisis. Where Britain stands out is in the severity of its reverse. The shortfall in productivity is the main reason real wages are now 4 percent lower than 10 years ago, a potent reason why the leave campaign prevailed in the Brexit referendum.

Peter Apps: Lessons from Zimbabwe's coup

Productivity is so central to prosperity and to macroeconomic management – by determining how fast the economy can sustainably grow – that a gaggle of economic researchers have been busy in their labs trying to diagnose the now decade-long disease. Early detective work highlighted the impact of the financial crisis itself, which was especially severe in Britain. This held back productivity by throttling bank credit to new potentially fast-growing ventures and by jamming up the usual way in which capital moves from declining to advancing sectors.

But as the crisis has receded and British banks have become better capitalized this explanation is less convincing. Longer-term forces appear to be in play in Britain and elsewhere. Firms at the technological frontier continue to forge ahead in raising productivity. However, the diffusion of their best practices within economies has slowed. An aging workforce is now acting as a drag. And the contribution to productivity from improved educational attainment is falling.

Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond will deliver his budget to the House of Commons on Nov. 22, 2017 REUTERS/Mary Turner

One reason the productivity setback has been particularly severe in Britain is that its apparently robust performance before the crisis was overstated and unsustainable. Banking activities ballooned on the basis of what turned out to be economically and socially harmful practices such as risky securitizations. Despite making up less than a tenth of the economy, the financial sector has been responsible for nearly a third of the productivity slowdown. Longstanding weaknesses in qualifications and skills have also become more damaging as business becomes more knowledge-based. Over a quarter of British working-age adults perform poorly in numeracy or literacy or both.

Investment is inadequate, too. Although firms have stepped up their capital spending after it collapsed during the recession, they have done much less so than in previous recoveries. Business investment is only 5 percent above its pre-crisis high a decade ago. At a similar stage in the recoveries following recessions at the start of 1980s and of the 1990s it was 63 percent and 30 percent higher than the respective previous peaks.

The reluctance to invest in turn is rooted in a financial and business culture that is especially and perniciously short-termist in Britain. Firms under pressure from the markets are reluctant to make the strategic investments needed to keep productivity moving ahead. And too many British managers are simply not good enough.

Although a definitive diagnosis of the British productivity disease remains elusive there is a surprising degree of consensus about the treatment needed to resuscitate the patient. The chancellor’s to-do list should include steps to tackle congested roads and overcrowded trains, to support the sciences, to foster R&D in the private sector, and to upgrade Britain’s poor skills. Since competition spurs higher productivity as new and smarter firms drive out older and less productive businesses, Hammond needs Britain to be as open an economy as possible.

The remedies make good sense but they will not rescue the chancellor, who has in any case already announced more spending on infrastructure. First, they will take time to be effective. Second, finding more money for austerity-hit public services such as policing and health will add to the pressures on the public finances. And third, Brexit is now contributing to the productivity malaise as businesses respond to corrosive uncertainties by curbing their investment plans and as Britain becomes less open to trade by leaving the EU. Raising taxes is always an option for a cash-strapped chancellor, but it would be highly unpopular − not least in the bitterly divided Conservative party.

When he presents his budget, Hammond can be expected to put a brave face on things. He will point to the fall in the budget deficit from a peak of almost 10 percent of GDP after the financial crisis to 2.3 percent of GDP in the financial year ending in March 2017. But what matters now is the future path of the public finances. Britain’s poor productivity prospects will box the chancellor in because GDP is the tax base and future revenues will be smaller to the extent that output per hour worked continues to stall.

The harsh reality is that Brexit will blight the public finances by hurting productivity. While Prime Minister May might see Britain’s overriding priority as ensuring that next month’s summit enables the Brexit talks to move on to trade, she’ll have to broaden her focus if she hopes to stay in office long enough to secure a deal that minimizes the damage Brexit is inflicting on the economy.",Commentary: Britain’s gravest economic challenge isn’t Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-productivity-commentary/commentary-britains-gravest-economic-challenge-isnt-brexit-idUSKBN1DK05N

The U.S. technology giant has been in talks with Indian officials for months, seeking “pre-requisites” - government tax breaks and incentives - for expanding its operations in one of the world’s fastest-growing smartphone markets.

During those talks, Apple has conveyed it wants India to defer an existing policy that plans to levy taxes on more imported mobile components in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” drive to boost domestic manufacturing.

While India’s government has been keen to get Apple to manufacture in India as a showpiece investment, it has told the U.S. firm there would be no policy exemptions, so there will be no tax breaks on parts imports, the people said.

“Apple wants duty-free imports of components. India wants indigenization,” said one person with direct knowledge of the talks.

Apple has expressed willingness to increase local value addition over time, but has stuck to its demand for immediate import tax relief to expand its iPhone manufacturing, the person added.

Apple declined to comment, and there was no response from either Modi’s office or the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which is trying to help build an electronics manufacturing base.

NO SPECIAL TREATMENT

The disagreement could be a stumbling block, and risks delaying Apple’s plans to penetrate the Indian market, where it currently just assembles its iPhone SE model.

FILE PHOTO: A man talks on his iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File photo

Despite a boom in smartphone sales in India, Apple’s market share is only around 2 percent.

Apple has demanded the tax relief as India still lacks an ideal ecosystem for parts makers to thrive. Counterpoint Research data shows that while more than three-quarters of smartphones sold in India are made locally, about 90 percent of the $14 billion worth of mobile components are imported.

To change that scenario, India imposes a 10 percent tax on imported components such as batteries, chargers and headsets.

Under a “phased manufacturing program” (PMP), the government plans to extend the taxes to more components as a way of nudging parts makers to switch to more local production.

“It’s been a chicken-and-egg problem for component suppliers whether to set up manufacturing operations in India,” said Neil Shah, a director at Counterpoint. “Apple and its partners will eventually have to comply, otherwise Apple will always price its products at a premium.”

A previously unreported note prepared by India’s IT ministry assessing Apple’s demands showed the company sought an exemption from PMP, which the ministry said “may not be feasible”.

Some of Apple’s other demands - including capital equipment incentives as well as allowing importing and then exporting phones after repairs - would require policy changes, according to the note.

While the government has publicly said it is still considering Apple’s demands, the people familiar with the talks said it has made clear it won’t make any special concessions.

“We have told them, please come and invest but we cannot do things that go beyond our policies. We cannot do things only for you,” said one senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter. “They are coming around (to our view).”

Apple has said it would be able to create 5,000-10,000 jobs in India as and when it expands there, the official said.","Apple, India wrangle over import tax on mobile parts: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/copy-apple-india/apple-india-wrangle-over-import-tax-on-mobile-parts-sources-idINKBN1E50WI

But the conversation also needs to address a dangerous – and largely ignored – interconnected public health crisis wreaking havoc among young Americans.

The problem is that more Americans than ever are injecting opioids and inadvertently infecting themselves with hepatitis C. Shared needles mean shared blood-borne infections – and that’s how the opioid crisis has created a new generation of hepatitis C patients. The number of reported hepatitis C infections nearly tripled from 2010 to 2015, with the virus is spreading at an unprecedented rate among young people under 30 – who are now, for the first time, the most at-risk population for contracting and transmitting hepatitis C.

In the United States, an estimated 3.5 million people, and likely more, are currently living with hepatitis C. The virus kills nearly 20,000 Americans each year – more than HIV and all other infectious diseases combined.

Hepatitis C attacks the liver, causing cirrhosis — or scarring of the liver — and leads to severe liver damage, liver cancer and liver failure. The virus is the leading cause of liver cancer — the fastest-growing cause of cancer mortality in the U.S., which kills twice as many Americans now than it did in the 1980s. Driven by young people who inject drugs, new cases of liver disease have nearly tripled nationwide in just a few years.

Fortunately, we now have an unprecedented chance to eliminate the virus. More and more treatments are available that provide cure rates of over 95 percent, without the debilitating side-effects of older and far less effective hepatitis C therapies. These newer treatments, known as direct-acting antivirals, eliminate the hepatitis C virus from the body, stopping the virus’ attack on the liver and preventing the patient from infecting others.

While some of these treatments made national headlines for their initial $1,000-a-pill sticker prices, that time has passed. Due to increased competition as new treatment options have entered the market over the last three years, the cost of a cure has dropped dramatically. The price will decrease even further as additional alternative cures are approved.

For too many Americans, however, barriers to getting cured remain. While access has increased significantly for the more than 216 million Americans with private insurance and the 53 million who have Medicare, state Medicaid programs are a different story. The more than 70 million low-income Americans covered by Medicaid, including low-income adults, children, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities, continue to face severely limited access to cures for hepatitis C.

Negotiated discounts to Medicaid are proprietary and confidential, but we know that the price to Medicaid for leading hepatitis C medications is now in the $20,000-$30,000 range — far less than the cost of treating the liver damage and cancer caused by hepatitis C. Each year, hepatitis C-positive patients average more than five times the hospitalizations and more than three times the number of emergency room visits as patients without the virus. Hepatitis C is also the underlying cause of approximately 30 percent of all liver transplants performed in the U.S. — an operation which costs an estimated $577,000 and thousands more to maintain ongoing health.

But it’s not just about the cost-effectiveness of the cure. Medicaid is America’s safety-net health care program for low-income individuals, and it is required by law to provide access to medically necessary treatments. As an entitlement program, there is no such thing as a waiting list or set budget in Medicaid. The program is specifically designed to shrink and expand to respond to public health needs, disease outbreaks and treatment advances.

It’s time that all state Medicaid programs start treating hepatitis C as the public health threat that it is, but that’s not what is happening in most states.

In our new report, Hepatitis C: State of Medicaid Access, we graded all 50 state Medicaid programs, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, according to access to hepatitis C cures. More than half of Medicaid programs received a “D” or an “F” for withholding a cure based on restrictions related to liver disease progression, sobriety requirements, and limitations on who can prescribe the treatments.

All of these restrictions contradict established treatment recommendations from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Infectious Disease Society of America. They also run afoul of guidance from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which states clearly that some states are limiting access to hepatitis C treatment in violation of federal Medicaid law. The guidance to states puts Medicaid programs on notice that they must comply with the requirement to provide medically necessary treatments, and this obligation has been confirmed by U.S. Federal District Court decisions.

Not only are these restrictions imprudent from a public health, cost-savings, and moral perspective, but they are medically unfounded. A growing body of research shows that drug-users can be cured just as easily as people who don’t use drugs – and that curing the virus in substance users can lead to low re-infection rates.

Current restrictions do nothing but needlessly jeopardize the health and wellbeing of hepatitis C patients and the general public. With opioid addiction at an all-time high, there is no justification for prohibiting drug users – the population most likely to spread this highly communicable disease — from accessing a cure.

States that are still rationing a cure based on outdated cost concerns and imaginary medical concerns are not only allowing the hepatitis C epidemic to spread, they’re exacerbating the lasting aftermath of the opioid crisis. It’s time for them to look at the bigger picture.",Commentary: The hidden health crisis of the opioid epidemic,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greenwald-hepatitis-commentary/commentary-the-hidden-health-crisis-of-the-opioid-epidemic-idUSKBN1E12XN

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.

The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP.

Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.

Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.

“The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”

Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.

Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.

VOLATILITY CONCERNS

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

The group’s shares have shed 38 percent so far this year compared with an increase of 24 percent for Atos.

The bid comes as Gemalto, the world’s largest maker of chips found in mobile phones and credit cards, is under pressure after posting four profit warnings in a year and having missed a chance to strengthen its security business through a large acquisition.

The combination would strengthen Atos in the burgeoning so-called Internet of Things (IoT) sector of internet-connected machinery and household devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors and European payment services on top of digital security, it said.

Atos said it delivered an offer to Gemalto’s board on Nov. 28.

Shortly after issuing the formal offer, Atos Chief Executive Thierry Breton said he had already received the backing of Gemalto’s biggest shareholder, France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.

“I’ve met the main shareholders and Bpi in particular,” Breton said in a call with reporters following the announcement of the unsolicited bid for Gemalto.

“Bpi is not only favorable to this operation of European consolidation, but it also authorized me to tell you about it,” he added.

Bpifrance holds 8.51 percent of Gemalto’s shares, according to the group’s last annual report. Gemalto and Bpifrance were not immediately reachable for comment.

STOCK PRESSURED

Gemalto had to postpone to March 2018 the presentation the presentation of its next multiyear strategic plan, after several profit warnings notably caused by slowing demand for credit card chips.

The group’s shares have shed 38 percent so far this year compared with an increase of 24 percent for Atos.

Since Breton took the helm of Atos in November 2008, the firm has multiplied its stock price by close to six times, outperforming French rival Capgemini (CAPP.PA) and U.S. companies Accenture (ACN.N) and IBM (IBM.N).

Atos’ revenue has more than doubled over the period to reach 11.7 billion euros in 2016, after having bought assets from Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), U.S. group Xerox (XRX.N) and France-based computer company Bull.

Gemalto had sales of 3.2 billion euros in 2016.

The all-cash bid reflects a price of 46 euros per Gemalto share, representing a 42 percent premium on the group’s last closing price, Atos said in a statement.

The bid would be financed by Atos’ existing cash resources and debt, the company said without elaborating.

Breton said that two banks had already given their approval for a potential loan.

Reuters photographers witnessed the biggest stories of 2017 - from Donald Trump's first year as U.S. president to the flight of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, from Venezuela's crisis to the fall of Islamic State and a tower block inferno in London.

This feature presents some of their strongest images.

It also gives the photographers a chance to tell the stories behind their pictures and explain in their own words how the images were taken.

Through it all, the photographers raise a question that shows how close they were to the action: in moments of crisis, should they take pictures or try to help?

Toby Melville: ""I was on the footpath below the southeast end of Westminster bridge, shooting pictures for the on-going Brexit story. I saw in my peripheral vision a large dark shape around 3-5 metres away come over the parapet and hit the ground approximately 10 metres below.

I thought it was a terrible but isolated accident. I immediately called for an ambulance and ran to the top of the steps to try to get help at St Thomas's, the nearby hospital. While on the phone, I saw a couple more people lying on the pavement amongst debris, covered in blood or unconscious.

There were other people scattered along the bridge and pavement in various states of injury and distress. I realised this was not an accident but something premeditated. As the emergency services were on the scene now, I started taking photos along the bridge.

I was unsure if danger was still present. I didn't know a car had been driven into these people. I hadn't heard any screams, loud engine noises or the gunshots of the armed police shooting and killing the perpetrator of the attack, Khalid Masood. I thought the injured or dead might also have been shot and a gunman might still be on the loose.

Armed police arrived and cleared the bridge. I called the office and started filing photographs from the back of the camera, transmitting most of the frames I had shot for the office to choose, edit and crop. A week later I walked back over the bridge, everything was 'back to normal', in a way.

But the sight of the first victim falling and the sickening thud as he hit the pavement still goes through my mind. I wonder whether I should have transmitted all the frames I shot. The sequence of pictures is hard to look at. I remind myself I was lucky. I had walked over the bridge about a minute before the attack. Others weren't so fortunate.""",2017: A picture and its story,https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/2017-a-picture-and-its-story

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

While the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp has said foreign investment accounts for only about 10 percent of sales activity, policymakers and voters alike have seized on the issue has a driving force behind precarious markets in both cities.

Statistics Canada’s C$39.9 million, five-year project to better measure the market - using land registries and tax records, among other data - will kick off on Dec. 19 with the foreign investment data for Toronto and Vancouver, which together account for about 50 percent of home sales by value.

“It’s a good thing that this is coming, but it would have been better to have it years ago. Government policy has been reactive, whether they had evidence or not to base a reaction on,” said David Madani, senior economist with Capital Economics.

The most obvious example of policy made without proof of a need for it is the 15 percent foreign buyers’ tax, levied in Toronto and Vancouver in 2017 and 2016, respectively, by provincial governments under pressure to do something about soaring housing prices.

While the tax initially dampened sales in both Toronto and Vancouver, demand has came trickling back, confirming the conviction of those who said foreign buyers were never behind the housing boom.

“We assume it is foreign ownership ... increasing the price of housing, but is it true? The big questions are still there, we don’t know and until we get proper data, we are not quite sure,” said Anik Lacroix, an assistant director at Statistics Canada who is leading the project.

While the unknowns of foreign buyers is the highest-profile gap in the data, Lacroix hopes to tackle many others, including where buyers get their downpayments, how many homes are vacant, how much demand comes from investors and speculators and how much prices have actually been rising.

With much of the current data coming from the real estate industry, official data will help government and regulators better manage the market.

While both Seoul and Beijing share the goal of getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two neighbors have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.

China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tensions with North Korea.

At his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this year on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea’s agreement with China in late October the two would normalize all exchanges and move past the year-long spat over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two.

The THAAD dispute had dented South Korea’s economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were canceled.

While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea’s decision to deploy it.

In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD’s presence is inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.

“South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China’s security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,” Moon said.

Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have “good results” if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, he added.

Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have “friendly cooperation” with China, and that China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula.

In its latest missile provocation, Pyongyang test-launched what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it continues its mission to create a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the United States.

During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses partaking in the four-day visit.

Before returning to Seoul, Moon will head to Chongqing to meet with its Communist Party boss Chen Miner, a close ally of Xi‘s.","South Korea's Moon, China's Xi to talk North Korea, trade in Beijing summit",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-southkorea-china/south-koreas-moon-chinas-xi-to-talk-north-korea-trade-in-beijing-summit-idUKKBN1E608J

The decision may yield some domestic political advantage among Jewish and evangelical Christian voters for the president, but at irrationally high expense globally.

Jerusalem is where Israel's president presides, and where the parliament, supreme court, and most government ministries are located. In practical terms, it is the capital. However, unlike in nearly every other nation, the United States maintains its formal embassy in another city, Tel Aviv. It keeps a consulate in West Jerusalem and a consular annex in East Jerusalem, the part of the city annexed by Israel in 1967 and expected by many Palestinians to be the capital of their future state. Washington also has an office directly on the Green Line, the division point between Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Diplomats, as well as Israeli officials, understand normally an embassy is the head office located in the capital, and a consulate is a less important branch located elsewhere. But they also know from experience in Israel which door to knock on when they need to get business done, regardless of what the nameplate reads out front.

MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY

Sarah Leah Whitson: Why Iraq should limit Islamic State Trials

Peter Apps: Blame Russia. But not too much.

This kind of thing is not unique to Israel. A similar system in Taiwan has kept the peace there.

In 1979 the United States recognized the reality of the People's Republic of China, with Beijing as its capital, and shifted formal relations from Taiwan. Instead of an embassy in Taipei, the United States established the American Institute in Taiwan. An actual registered non-governmental organization, the Institute benefits from the Department of State providing ""a large part of funding and guidance in its operations,"" never mind the entire staff. Yet there is no ambassador at the Institute; the chief representative is called the director. A whole sitcom worth of diplomatic parlor tricks keeps the enterprise in Taipei not an embassy of the United States.

That all allows Washington, Taipei and Beijing to focus on the practical work of relations without having to address the never-gonna-resolve-it-in-our-lifetimes geopolitical questions first. That’s why these things matter. That’s why Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocate the embassy pulls down the curtain, turns on the lights, and spray-paints day-glo yellow the 500-pound gorilla in the room.

In the case of the United States and Jerusalem, the kabuki which has maintained the status quo is the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. Under the act, the American headquarters stayed in Tel Aviv, business was done as needed, and everyone with a hand in the complex politics of the Middle East could look whichever way best fit their needs.

That law did require the United States to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem by 1999, but a politically expedient loophole allowed presidents to issue a waiver of the requirement every six months for national security reasons, thereby preventing Congress from exercising its power to withhold half the funds appropriated to the State Department for overseas building operations if the deadline wasn’t met.

Trump reluctantly issued the waiver a few months ago and then again just after announcing his recognition of Jerusalem, giving the State Department some bureaucratic breathing room on the funding issue while he plans to build a new structure somewhere in Jerusalem – a project that could take years.

The Jerusalem Embassy Act was a practical solution, not a failed plan that did not lead to formal peace between the Palestinians and Israel as Trump characterized it. The shadowplay status of Jerusalem worked.

No more. Trump’s action demands all players set aside whatever other issues they have in Israel, not the least of which is the Palestinian peace process, and instead take a stand on America’s changed position.

Trump’s decision has provoked a global uproar, with world leaders criticizing the move as irresponsible and dangerous. Of immediate concern is America's relationship with Jordan. Jordan has thrown in heavily with the United States, allowing its territory to be used as an entry point into Syria for American aid. The United States and Jordan broadly have a robust and multi-layered security arrangement, working well together in the war on Islamic State. It has been a steady relationship, albeit one often based on personal ties more than formal agreements, according to several American diplomats I spoke with.

Yet following Trump's announcement, Jordan’s King Abdullah II warned of ""dangerous repercussions on the stability and security of the region."" The issue of Jerusalem runs deep in Jordan: it was Abdullah's father, King Hussein, who lost East Jerusalem to Israel in the 1967 war, and Abdullah himself, under a 2013 agreement between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, is the custodian of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. American diplomats working in Amman will find every facet of the relationship colored and their skills tested – no Arab ruler can be seen being publicly pushed around, perhaps humiliated, by the United States.

A second blow could come in Washington's relationship with Egypt. More so than Jordan, Egypt's rulers must act in awareness of public opinion, with memories of the Arab Spring still fresh. In response to Trump's announcement, Egyptian parliamentarians called for a boycott of American products, including weapons purchases. Egypt is also no stranger to the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism, and one Egyptian minister warned Trump's decision would shift focus from fighting terrorists to inflaming them. The role Jerusalem plays in the radical Islamic canon cannot be over-estimated. And all of this comes at a sensitive time: Cairo just reached a preliminary agreement to allow Russian military jets to use Egyptian airspace and bases for the first time since 1973.

In the coming days there will be violence and protests. But long after the tear gas clears, American diplomats will find themselves hamstrung —entering negotiations on a full range of issues having to first somehow address the action taken by Trump. This is not an unnecessarily bombastic tweet that runs off the bottom of the page, or a crude remark which fades with the next news cycle: this time, the president overturned a working policy and the effects will resonate long after he leaves the White House.",Commentary: The terrible cost of Trump's Jerusalem decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-jerusalem-commentary/commentary-the-terrible-cost-of-trumps-jerusalem-decision-idUSKBN1E12DZ

Investors continued their policy vigil with the Federal Reserve set to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

Relations between Australia and China have become strained since Canberra announced last week it would ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics.

In announcing the ban, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull specifically singled out China, citing “disturbing reports about Chinese influence”.

China hit back, with the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily describing media reports about Chinese interference as “racist” and “paranoid”.

Dastyari, widely viewed as a rising star of the centre-left Labor opposition party, has been under fire since domestic media reported he had sought to encourage the party’s deputy leader not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing’s rule in Hong Kong in 2015.

“Today, after much reflection, I’ve decided that the best service I can render to the federal parliamentary Labor Party is to not return to the Senate in 2018,” Dastyari told reporters in Sydney.

The latest allegations came just days after Turnbull on Monday told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Dastyari had warned Chinese political donor Huang Xiangmo that his phone might be tapped.

Dastyari had already quit some senior Labor positions after a tape surfaced of him appearing to endorse China’s contentious expansion in disputed areas of the South China Sea, against his party’s platform. The tape showed him standing next to Huang.

Turnbull accused the opposition Labor Party of “failing to put Australia first”, rhetoric that analysts said could widen divisions between Canberra and Beijing.

“The row has erupted and it has claimed a political scalp,” said Euan Graham, director, international security programme at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.

“China could retaliate through non-official sanctions such as reduced tourist numbers or through buying of goods elsewhere.”

China bought A$93 billion ($69.95 billion) of Australian goods and services last year, making it easily the country’s biggest trade partner.

But growing trade ties are only one side of a delicate balancing act for Australia, whose unshakeable security relationship with the United States has limited how cosy it gets with China.

The recent political focus on Dastyari’s China links has been a welcome reprieve for Turnbull, who is suffering a slump in popularity in a country where three prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010.

Determined to cut African immigration across the Mediterranean, the governments, via the European Union, have provided support to Libya, trained its coastguard and spent millions of euros through U.N. agencies to improve conditions in detention camps where Libya puts the migrants.

The advocacy group said up to 20,000 people were now held in these centers and subject to “torture, forced labor, extortion, and unlawful killings”, adding to similar allegations made by other rights organizations over the past months.

“European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes,” John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s head for Europe, said.

The European Union’s executive arm, the European Commission, was not immediately available for comment.

Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under pressure from Italy, the main landing point. More than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years.

Amnesty said the Libyan coastguards - which the EU backs to intercept people heading for Europe - work hand-in-hand with people smugglers, including in torturing people to extort money.

“By supporting Libyan authorities in trapping people in Libya ... European governments have shown where their true priorities lie: namely the closure of the central Mediterranean route, with scant regard to the suffering caused,” said Dalhuisen.

With Libya being largely a lawless states since the fall of veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi, some EU officials and diplomats chafe at what they see as being forced to rely on sometimes shady characters in the matrix of alliances between militias.

However, EU leaders meeting for their final gathering this year in Brussels on Dec. 14-15 will recommit themselves to this strategy, which they see as bearing fruit in the form of fewer sea crossings.

Die EU-Außenbeauftragte Federica Mogherini sagte am Montag nach einem Treffen mit Israels Ministerpräsidenten Benjamin Netanjahu in Brüssel, die Union werde am internationalen Konsens zu Jerusalem festhalten. In Berlin verurteilte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel zugleich antisemitische Ausschreitungen vor der US-Botschaft und kündigte eine harte staatliche Antwort an. Seit US-Präsident Donald Trump vergangene Woche den Umzug der US-Botschaft von Tel Aviv nach Jerusalem angekündigt hat, gibt es weltweite Proteste. Netanjahu forderte die EU bei einem Besuch in Brüssel auf, dem amerikanischen Schritt zu folgen. “Die Anerkennung der Realität ist die Grundlage für Frieden”, sagte er.

Die EU-Regierungen wiesen die Forderung jedoch zurück. “Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass irgendein anderes Land oder ein EU-Staat dem Schritt folgen wird”, sagte Schwedens Außenministerin Margot Wallström nach einem Treffen mit ihren Amtskollegen und Netanjahu. Auch Ungarn und Tschechien, die vergangene Woche noch eine gemeinsame EU-Resolution verhindert hatten, deuteten ein Einlenken an. Der tschechische Außenminister Lubomir Zaoralk sagte zur Entscheidung Trumps: “Ich fürchte, das wird uns nicht helfen.” Auch seine Regierung halte an der Zweistaatenlösung fest, die neben einem israelischen Land auch einen palästinensischen Staat vorsieht. Ungarns Ministerpräsident Viktor Orban sagte, seine Regierung werde die Botschaft ebenfalls nicht nach Jerusalem verlegen.

Israel hatte Ost-Jerusalem 1967 erobert und später annektiert. Dies wird von der internationalen Gemeinschaft nicht anerkannt. Der Status der Stadt soll in einem Friedensvertrag zwischen Israel und den Palästinensern festgelegt werden. Die Palästinenser beanspruchen Jerusalem ebenfalls als ihre Hauptstadt. Die Botschaften ausländischer Staaten befinden sich derzeit in Tel Aviv.

Putin’s latest visit to Cairo reflects the deepening ties between Russia and Egypt, the second largest recipient of U.S. military aid after Israel and a strategic U.S. partner in the Middle East because of its control of the Suez Canal.

Putin, who flew on to Turkey, briefly visited a Russian base in Syria before arriving in Egypt and ordered Russian forces to start withdrawing from Syria after a two-year military campaign there.

In Cairo, Egyptian and Russian ministers signed a $21 billion deal to start work on Egypt’s Dabaa nuclear power plant and Putin said Moscow was ready to resume Russian civilian flights to Egypt.

Moscow halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight, downing the jet leaving from the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and killing 224 people on board.

The attack and Moscow’s decision damaged Egypt’s already struggling tourism industry. Egyptian airport inspections and talks to resume flights have been going on for months.

“The Russian security services have reported to me that, on the whole, we are ready for opening the direct air link between Moscow and Cairo,” Putin said. “This would require signing a corresponding intergovernmental protocol.”

Russia’s transport minister told reporters flights could resume in early February, and Russia was prepared to sign a protocol with Egypt this week.

Earlier, Russian state nuclear company Rosatom said the Dabaa nuclear station it will build in Egypt will have four reactors and cost up to $21 billion. Construction is expected to finish in 2028-2029.

Moscow and Cairo signed an initial agreement in 2015 for Russia to build the plant, with Russia extending a loan to Egypt to cover the cost of construction.

Sisi said the two leaders had also discussed industrial projects, trade and Russian investments in Egypt, including in the Suez Canal Economic Zone.

MILITARY COOPERATION

Sisi and Putin also discussed Syria and mutual rejection of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that has triggered protests across the region and from European capitals.

“We had a detailed exchange of views on key international issues. Our approaches either coincide completely or are really quite close,” Putin said.

The high-level Russian visit comes after the U.S. government in August decided to deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay another $195 million because of its failure to make progress on human rights and democratic norms.

Russia launched a military operation to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in September 2015, and there are signs Moscow is keen to expand its military presence in the region.

Neither leader on Monday mentioned an announcement from November when Russia’s government published a draft agreement between Russia and Egypt allowing both countries to use each other’s air space and air bases for their military planes.

But Putin has been steadily building relations with Egypt. On his first visit to Cairo in 2015, he was the first leader of a major power to meet with Sisi after the former Egyptian army commander ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013.

That prompted Washington to cool relations with Egypt, and the U.S. government suspended some military aid.

Since then the two leaders have increased cooperation, reviving the historical alliance between Egypt and Soviet Union of the 1970s.","Putin, Egypt's Sisi discuss restart of flights, sign nuclear deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1E51V8-OZATP

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, took his own case to Egypt on Monday and was expected to fly to Turkey for a meeting of Muslim countries this week, cementing support from leaders who say the U.S. move was a dire error.

President Donald Trump announced last Wednesday the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, breaking with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city’s status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a rocket into Israel and the Israeli military said it responded with air strikes and tank fire targeting a position of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the enclave.

On the ground in the Palestinian territories, violent clashes with Israeli security forces in which scores of Palestinians have been injured and several killed since the U.S. announcement last week appeared to have mostly subsided.

Netanyahu, on his first visit to EU headquarters in Brussels, said Trump’s move helped peace, “because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace”.

Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war, considers the entire city to be its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

The Trump administration says it remains committed to the peace process and its decision does not affect Jerusalem’s future borders or status. It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.

But even Israel’s closest European allies have rejected that logic and say recognizing Israel’s capital unilaterally risks inflaming violence and further wrecking the chance for peace.

After a breakfast meeting between Netanyahu and EU foreign ministers, Sweden’s top diplomat said no European at the closed-door meeting had voiced support for Trump’s decision, and no country was likely to follow the United States in announcing plans to move its embassy.

“I have a hard time seeing that any other country would do that and I don’t think any other EU country will do it,” Margot Wallstrom told reporters.

Israel’s position does appear to have more support from some EU states than others. Last week, the Czech foreign ministry said it would begin considering moving the Czech Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while Hungary blocked a planned EU statement condemning the U.S. move.

But Prague later said it accepted Israel’s sovereignty only over West Jerusalem, and Budapest said its long-term position seeking a two-state solution in the Middle East had not changed.

On Monday, Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said of Trump’s decision: “I‘m afraid it can’t help us.”

“I‘m convinced that it is impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution,” Zaoralek said. “We are talking about an Israeli state but at the same time we have to speak about a Palestinian state.”

The Palestinian president, Abbas, met Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Cairo, as well as the head of the Arab League. Egypt, a U.S. ally with a peace treaty with Israel, has brokered Israeli-Palestinian deals in the past.

“DUNGEON FOR MUSLIMS”

Moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem would have “dangerous effects on peace and security in the region”, Sisi said on Monday at an earlier meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Abbas was also due to fly to Turkey. Trump’s announcement has triggered a war of words between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Netanyahu, straining ties between the two U.S. allies which were restored only last year after a six-year breach that followed the Israeli storming of a Turkish aid ship.

On Sunday, Erdogan called Israel a “terror state”. Netanyahu responded by saying he would accept no moral lectures from Erdogan who he accused of bombing Kurdish villages, jailing opponents and supporting terrorists.

On Monday Erdogan took aim directly at Washington over Trump’s move: “The ones who made Jerusalem a dungeon for Muslims and members of other religions will never be able to clean the blood from their hands,” he said in a speech in Ankara. “With their decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United States has become a partner in this bloodshed.”

Trump’s announcement triggered days of protests across the Muslim world and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

In Beirut, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest at a march backed by Hezbollah, the heavily-armed Iran-backed Shi‘ite group whose leader called last week for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel. An announcer led the crowd in chants of “Death to America! Death to Israel!”

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah told the crowd by video link the group was turning its focus back toward the fight against Israel: “Today the axis of resistance, including Hezbollah, will return as its most important priority ... Jerusalem and Palestine and the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance in all its factions.”

“STOP PAMPERING”

Netanyahu, who has been angered by the EU’s search for closer business ties with Iran, said Europeans should emulate Trump’s move and press the Palestinians to do so, too.

“It’s time that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state and also recognize the fact that it has a capital. It’s called Jerusalem,” he said. In comments filmed later on his plane, he said he had told the Europeans to “stop pampering the Palestinians”, who “need a reality check”.

The decision to recognize Jerusalem could also strain Washington’s ties with another of its major Muslim allies, Saudi Arabia, which has sought closer relations with Washington under Trump than under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Saudi Arabia shares U.S. and Israeli concerns about the increasing regional influence of Iran, and was seen as a potential broker for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal. But Saudis have suggested that unilateral decisions over Jerusalem make any such rapprochement more difficult.

Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States and veteran ex-security chief, published a strongly-worded open letter to Trump on Monday.

“Bloodshed and mayhem will definitely follow your opportunistic attempt to make electoral gain,” the prince wrote in the letter, published in the Saudi newspaper al-Jazeera.

“Your action has emboldened the most extreme elements in the Israeli society ... because they take your action as a license to evict the Palestinians from their lands and subject them to an apartheid state,” he added. “Your action has equally emboldened Iran and its terrorist minions to claim that they are the legitimate defenders of Palestinian rights.”

They are members of EDG, one of China’s top electronic sports teams, who spend six days a week in a military-style training compound to become world beaters in video games.

EDG’s players - when not doing yoga to stay limber - spend most of their time at the camp wielding virtual weaponry playing multi-player battle games like “League of Legends” or Tencent Holdings Ltd’s popular “Honour of Kings”.

The team’s top players can rake in up to 30 million yuan ($4.54 million) a year each from tournament prize money, commercial endorsements and payments from avid fans who spend hours watching them play online.

China’s craze for e-sports is being propelled by the country’s booming video game market, the world’s largest and one that is expected to register $27.5 billion in sales this year, according to the gaming consultancy Newzoo.

Game developers like Tencent and NetEase Inc, and others like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, are competing to market video games, fill stadiums with fans and sell broadcast rights to the matches.

“We have found the fastest-growing and biggest demand is in e-sports, and we are following that trend,” said Wang Guan, general manager of e-sports at Alisports, an Alibaba subsidiary.

Cities around the country are looking to cash in on the market’s fast growth with video game theme-parks and e-sports venues. Some universities are even rolling out gaming degrees.

Alisports, which organizes the World Electronic Sports Games, successfully lobbied the Olympic Council of Asia to include e-sports at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou.

The extent of the e-gaming boom was on display in Beijing in November at the world final of League of Legends, with a prize of over $4 million at stake.

A crowd of more than 40,000 people packed into the city’s Olympic Bird’s Nest stadium to watch the South Korean gaming stars Faker and CuVee go head to head.

The raucous crowd, a bigger turnout than most local soccer games, underlined how popular gaming as a hobby and spectator sport has become in China.

Jiang Ping, 17, a university student in Beijing, paid 4,000 yuan to watch the final with his aunt. They were lucky: tickets sold on the gray market reportedly rose to more than 20 times the original price due to high demand.

“When I started playing this game five years ago, there weren’t that many people,” Jiang said. “Now the numbers are huge, and even the game itself is now owned by a Chinese firm, Tencent.”

Tencent owns the League of Legends developer Riot Games.

TENCENT OR DIE

The city of Wuhu, a backwater three hours away from Shanghai, is a symbol of China’s gaming potential - as well as its risks.

Many local governments have been seeking to develop more specialized industries, and Wuhu has targeted e-sports. In May, the city signed a deal with Tencent to build an e-sports university and a stadium for events. Other cities, like Zhongxian in the municipality of Chongqing, are also building facilities to profit from the e-sports boom.

Some industry participants, however, are already worried about a bubble forming, and rising debt levels as local governments jump into e-sports investment.

“Maybe some of the developers don’t have pure intentions, they are just using e-sports as an excuse to get land at a cheap price from local government,” said Tao Junyin, marketing director of VSPN, a leading e-sports content company.

Han Li, manager of Wuhu’s e-sports association, said the city had discussed ideas including an e-sports-themed hotpot restaurant, bar and cinema, in addition to the gaming school and arena.

Ultimately, though, China’s gaming giants are the ones calling the shots, he said.

“Tencent has a controlling power in the whole industry, so we have to find a way to work with Tencent. You either die or you go Tencent,” he said.

Tencent declined to comment.

SOCIALIST VALUES

Local gamers also face tougher regulation than peers in the United States, South Korea or Japan, with a recent government push to emphasize “core socialist values” in entertainment products including songs, online streaming and video games.

This year, Tencent limited the time children could play its popular Honour of Kings game after coming under fire over gaming addiction. In November it said it would bring the top-selling game “Playerunknown’s Battleground” to China, but would tweak the game to fit with “socialist core values”.

Tencent’s main local rival, NetEase, has already embedded banners with patriotic slogans into one of its popular battlefield games to head off official criticism.

“In China, you have to follow the government’s decree,” said Tao of VSPN. “But you can always make moderations to the games so that it will pass the censor.”

Nonetheless, China’s youth seem enthralled, prompting some universities to start offering e-sports degrees, from professional gaming to e-sports commentating and graphic design.

Liu Xuefeng, a freshman from Anhui province, applied for a gaming degree program in the western city of Chengdu - despite facing push-back from his concerned parents.

“I am very interested in this program, and they couldn’t stop me, so they had to cave in the end,” he said, adding that he wanted to be an e-sports commentator. “There is great potential in the development of the gaming business.”

The allure of becoming the next big gaming star is already sparking fierce competition to get into the market, said David Ng, head of Super Generation Investment, which owns the EDG e-sports team.

“Sometimes we will have a thousand application letters in our mail box to join our team on a single day.”

Co-founder Travis Kalanick once said his company was in a campaign where “the incumbent is an asshole called taxi.” New boss Dara Khosrowshahi just pulled a U-turn in Singapore by striking a deal with ComfortDelGro, the powerful local cab operator.

It has been a rough ride for Uber in Southeast Asia. As with the rest of the continent, cutthroat competition against deep-pocketed peers caused the company to burn through billions. China’s $500 billion Tencent, for example, backs Indonesia’s Go Jek. Softbank, which is in the process of trying to plow another $10 billion into Uber, also has helped finance rivals. There have been regulatory problems in Singapore, too, where Uber was accused of knowingly renting out faulty vehicles. It said it swiftly fixed the problem.

That backdrop makes it sensible for the company to embrace the competition. Similar deals signed in Malaysia and Myanmar should help Uber get bigger. In the Lion City, it is surrendering 51 percent of a 14,000-car rental subsidiary in exchange for more drivers on its system.

ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is buying some needed growth. It boasts the largest fleet in Singapore, with more than 15,500 cabs. Taxi revenue, however, fell over 11 percent in the third quarter of this year. Having its cars pop up on the Uber app should improve their efficiency and the top line.

Uber is a long way from securing its place in the region, though. After it first disclosed talks with ComfortDelGro, Grab secured $700 million in debt financing to expand its own rental fleet and a partnership with Singapore’s public transport titan, SMRT.

A China-like retreat eventually could be tempting. There, Uber sold its business to Didi Chuxing to cut whopping losses, but kept a stake to capture at least some of the potential upside.

For the time being, there is room to expand, especially considering the youthful market in cities like Manila or Jakarta, where traffic is bad and parking worse. Further consolidation also is bound to occur.

The 26-year-old underwent shoulder surgery earlier this year and faced nine months on the sidelines but returned for Western Australia in October and scored 680 runs in all forms of cricket at an average of 68.

He has scored two centuries, a 95 and 80 in his 14 innings and is expected to be in competition with Peter Handscomb for a position in the third test lineup.

If selected, elder brother Shaun is likely to move to number five with Mitchell slotting in at six, where his medium-pace bowling will complement the all-out pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.

“I am renowned as the ‘glue’ of the fast bowling cartel,” Marsh told reporters in Perth on Tuesday.

“I did a bit of sucking up and I‘m back in their WhatsApp group. The cartel are happy to have me back. I got invited to dinner last night. It was a huge honour,” he added with a laugh.

While Marsh’s improved batting had no doubt put him back in the frame, the all-rounder said his reconstructed shoulder was holding up well to the rigours of bowling.

“Shoulder’s feeling really good, body’s feeling really good, got through the last two Shield games bowling, ready to go if I get the chance,” he said.

Putin, who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March, made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia’s Hmeymim air base in Syria - his first since Russia intervened in the conflict. He held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces.

The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting his Egyptian and Turkish counterparts, Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given him to cast himself as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force.

The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad’s favor. Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal.

“In just over two years, Russia’s armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists,” Putin told Russian servicemen.

A “significant part” of the Russian force could now return home. “The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created,” said Putin. “The Motherland awaits you.”

Washington was skeptical about Putin’s statement.

“Russian comments about removal of their forces do not often correspond with actual troop reductions, and do not affect U.S. priorities in Syria,” said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon.

Putin made clear in any case that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback.

Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia’s help, saying the blood of Moscow’s “martyrs” had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army. It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past.

Russia’s main contribution has been air strikes, and with Iran-backed Shi’ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground, the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation.

Russia’s campaign, which has been extensively covered on state TV at home, has not caught the imagination of most Russians. But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention.

The use of private military contractors, something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defense ministry, has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low.

Officially, less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign, but the real number, including private contractors, is estimated to be much higher.

ELECTORAL BOOST?

Russia’s “mission accomplished” moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters.

Though polls show he will easily win, they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics, and Putin’s supporters are keen to get him re-elected on a big turnout, which in their eyes confers legitimacy.

Putin, who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia’s political landscape for the last 17 years, told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors.

Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags, Putin said his military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a “sovereign independent state.”

Slideshow (4 Images)

“I congratulate you!” Putin told the servicemen.

Putin is keen to organize a special event in Russia - the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution.

When asked about Putin’s announcement, Yahya Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Geneva, said it welcomed any step that brought Syria closer to real peace.

Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces, its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback.

Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria’s Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous “on a permanent basis,” said Putin.

Both bases are protected by sophisticated air defense missile systems.

Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining center.

However, Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities.

“We’ve seen such announcements before, which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared,” said one European diplomat who declined to be named.

“The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva (peace talks). Absent that, the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation.”","Putin, in Syria, says mission accomplished, orders partial Russian pull-out",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-russia-putin/putin-in-syria-says-mission-accomplished-orders-partial-russian-pull-out-idUKKBN1E50Z7

Chilton was a self-proclaimed hardliner on enforcement, and wrote in September that if he were still at the agency, he would have pushed for an investigation into this year’s huge price swings in bitcoin. Now he wants to bring respectability to the digital realm by making an initial coin offering of OilCoin, a virtual token backed by the physical commodity. The group says it will comply with U.S. regulatory requirements, and use the proceeds to buy oil futures and other oil-related products. The goal is to keep the price of each OilCoin trading close to the price of crude.

It’s not as if investors need new ways of playing the volatile oil market. Futures contracts and ETFs backed by oil are widely available and heavily traded, as are shares in companies like Exxon Mobil and BP. But the new coin does offer a tax advantage. Because it’s considered property, investors pay capital gains tax only when they sell, as opposed to annual taxes like other investment funds.

Backers say OilCoin will be more stable than other crypto-currencies because it is backed by hard assets rather than digital faith. But in a week when bitcoin surged nearly $6,000 then gave up a third of those gains, it’s not clear that investors are in this market for stability.

The idea that it will be a usable currency is even more of a stretch. The surging price of bitcoin has effectively made it a pure speculative vehicle. Even bitcoin cash, a breakaway intended to be used for transactions, has climbed sharply. The arrival next week of U.S. bitcoin futures, after a green light from the CFTC, could generate even more volatility. And there’s no end to crypto-currencies flooding the market.

News of the new coin comes just days after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the economically prostrate country would launch an oil-backed currency, the petro. Chilton and his partners have more respectable pedigrees. But what they’re peddling relies more on crypto-hype than genuine utility. It’s virtually snake oil.",Breakingviews - Crude-backed crypto-coin is mostly snake oil,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-currency-crypto-breakingviews/breakingviews-crude-backed-crypto-coin-is-mostly-snake-oil-idUSKBN1E22MV

Canada and the United States are due to co-host a meeting of foreign ministers in Vancouver in January to discuss North Korea.

North Korea has fired missiles over Japan as it pursues nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Last week it said U.S. and South Korean military drills meant the outbreak of war was “an established fact”.

During a day trip to Ottawa on Dec. 19 Tillerson will also meet Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, said the source, who requested anonymity because the meetings have not yet been formally announced.

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.29 a barrel at 0253 GMT, up 60 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last close.

That marks the first time Brent has risen above $65 since June, 2015.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $58.30 a barrel, up 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement.

“Brent crude raced higher ... as news broke that the North Sea’s Forties Pipeline system would have to be shut down for a ‘number of weeks’ after a hairline crack was found in it,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “The pipeline ... is a significant component underpinning the Brent benchmark.”

Britain’s Forties oil pipeline, the country’s largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were revealed.

“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.

GOING WIDE

The jump in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices to almost $7 a barrel, up from around $5 last week, making U.S. oil exports more attractive. CL-LCO1=R

The cheaper WTI is also a result of rising U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.71 million bpd, levels not seen since the early 1970s.

U.S. production is now also not far off that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The rising U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, to support prices by withholding supplies.

A tweet by Trump in May read simply: “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.”

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content.

On Monday, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts under the new rules. The agencies said the proposal will “return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs.”

Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “will work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”

Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block, throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said the agreement “is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.”

The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. ”The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said “FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact -- many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed.”

Chris Lewis, vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC is “joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public. This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you.”

Democrats and net neutrality advocates plan a series of protests ahead of Thursday’s vote. Pai’s proposal has already won the backing of the three Republicans on the five-member commission. The reversal represents a victory for big internet providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that opposed the 2015 rules.

Pai’s proposal is opposed by large internet companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).

“It came from a good place and I guess that’s why I‘m here.”","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand’s bowlers steadily chipped away at the West Indies lineup to record a ruthless 240-run victory shortly before tea on the fourth day of the second test at Seddon Park in Hamilton on Tuesday to wrap up a 2-0 series sweep.

Mitchell Santner took wickets on successive balls to end the tourists’ second innings on 203 for nine as they tried in vain to chase the 444 runs needed to secure an unlikely drawn series after New Zealand dominated the first test in Wellington.

The hosts did not need to take all 10 wickets after Sunil Ambris retired hurt when a short Neil Wagner delivery broke his arm, as the visitors resumed on 30-2 and were never really able to establish a solid partnership throughout the day.

“New Zealand did a great job but when we batted we didn’t produce, especially in the first innings of the first test,” stand-in West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said.

“Tough loss, but we saw on the bouncy pitches that we have to be better with our shot selection and we need to be more incisive.”

Trent Boult became the sixth New Zealander to claim 200 test wickets when he had Brathwaite caught in the gully by skipper Kane Williamson for 20 to leave the visitors floundering at 43-3 and they failed to recover from the early blow.

“It was great to put two strong performances on the board. Credit to the way we stuck to our plans and executed them well in both games,” Williamson told reporters.

“Both teams fought really hard but it was nice for us to stick to our plans for long periods and get the rewards.”

Boult was not the only New Zealander to achieve a significant personal milestone during the game with Ross Taylor joining former mentor Martin Crowe and Williamson on 17 test centuries, the most by a New Zealander, on Monday.

Taylor finished on 107 not out when Williamson declared on 291-8 with about an hour’s play remaining on the third day.

Crowe, who died in 2016, has had a major impact on Taylor’s career, helping him transform from a swashbuckling, and at times impetuous, batsman into a player able to dominate attacks.

“At the start of my career if you’d told me I’d get 17 test hundreds, I’ve had said ‘no chance’,” Taylor told reporters after the milestone.

”I always thought I’d be just a white-ball player.

While the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp has said foreign investment accounts for only about 10 percent of sales activity, policymakers and voters alike have seized on the issue has a driving force behind precarious markets in both cities.

Statistics Canada’s C$39.9 million, five-year project to better measure the market - using land registries and tax records, among other data - will kick off on Dec. 19 with the foreign investment data for Toronto and Vancouver, which together account for about 50 percent of home sales by value.

“It’s a good thing that this is coming, but it would have been better to have it years ago. Government policy has been reactive, whether they had evidence or not to base a reaction on,” said David Madani, senior economist with Capital Economics.

The most obvious example of policy made without proof of a need for it is the 15 percent foreign buyers’ tax, levied in Toronto and Vancouver in 2017 and 2016, respectively, by provincial governments under pressure to do something about soaring housing prices.

While the tax initially dampened sales in both Toronto and Vancouver, demand has came trickling back, confirming the conviction of those who said foreign buyers were never behind the housing boom.

“We assume it is foreign ownership ... increasing the price of housing, but is it true? The big questions are still there, we don’t know and until we get proper data, we are not quite sure,” said Anik Lacroix, an assistant director at Statistics Canada who is leading the project.

While the unknowns of foreign buyers is the highest-profile gap in the data, Lacroix hopes to tackle many others, including where buyers get their downpayments, how many homes are vacant, how much demand comes from investors and speculators and how much prices have actually been rising.

With much of the current data coming from the real estate industry, official data will help government and regulators better manage the market.

Ben Williams, director of housing indicators and analytics at the CMHC said there is no silver bullet that will answer all the questions on housing, but they are braced for high expectations as the new data starts rolling out.",Canada beefing up housing data as policy pushes ahead,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1E52DL-OCATP

FILE PHOTO - Atos Chairman and CEO Thierry Breton poses in front of the company's logo during a presentation of the new Bull sequana supercomputer in Paris, France, April 12, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer

The bid comes as Gemalto, the world’s largest maker of chips found in mobile phones and credit cards, is under pressure after posting four profit warnings in a year and having missed a chance to strengthen its security business through a large acquisition.

The combination would strengthen Atos in the burgeoning so-called Internet of Things (IoT) sector of internet-connected machinery and household devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors and European payment services on top of digital security, it said.

Atos said it delivered an offer to Gemalto’s board on Nov. 28.

Shortly after issuing the formal offer, Atos Chief Executive Thierry Breton said he had already received the backing of Gemalto’s biggest shareholder, France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.

“I’ve met the main shareholders and Bpi in particular,” Breton said in a call with reporters following the announcement of the unsolicited bid for Gemalto.

“Bpi is not only favorable to this operation of European consolidation, but it also authorized me to tell you about it,” he added.

Bpifrance holds 8.51 percent of Gemalto’s shares, according to the group’s last annual report. Gemalto and Bpifrance were not immediately reachable for comment.

STOCK PRESSURED

Gemalto had to postpone to March 2018 the presentation the presentation of its next multiyear strategic plan, after several profit warnings notably caused by slowing demand for credit card chips.

The group’s shares have shed 38 percent so far this year compared with an increase of 24 percent for Atos.

Since Breton took the helm of Atos in November 2008, the firm has multiplied its stock price by close to six times, outperforming French rival Capgemini (CAPP.PA) and U.S. companies Accenture (ACN.N) and IBM (IBM.N).

Atos’ revenue has more than doubled over the period to reach 11.7 billion euros in 2016, after having bought assets from Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), U.S. group Xerox (XRX.N) and France-based computer company Bull.

Gemalto had sales of 3.2 billion euros in 2016.

The all-cash bid reflects a price of 46 euros per Gemalto share, representing a 42 percent premium on the group’s last closing price, Atos said in a statement.

The bid would be financed by Atos’ existing cash resources and debt, the company said without elaborating.

Breton said that two banks had already given their approval for a potential loan.

The latest promising news came from China where banks doled out a surprisingly generous dose of credit in November, which could bode well for a pick up in retail sales and industrial output due later in the week.

There was no lasting market impact from an explosion in New York’s busy Port Authority commuter hub which New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described as an “attempted terrorist attack.”

Investors continued their policy vigil with the Federal Reserve set to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

The last time the spread was that plump was in 1999.

Yet the euro is currently up 12 percent on the dollar this year, while the dollar is down 8 percent on a basket of currencies .DXY - an indication interest rate differentials aren’t everything in forex.

On Tuesday, the euro was steady at $1.1768 EUR= having failed to clear resistance around $1.1812 overnight. The dollar was idling at 113.48 yen JPY=, just off a one-month top of 113.69.

Dealers at Citi noted interbank volumes in the forex market had been 35 percent below average overnight and another thin session was likely on Tuesday.

There was a little more action in bitcoin, which was last at $16,350 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP while its newly minted futures contract <0#XBT:> fell back to $17,800.

In commodity markets, gold remained out of favor at $1,243.90 an ounce XAU= having suffered its biggest weekly drop since May last week.

Oil prices pushed ahead in the wake of news of a temporary shutdown of a pipeline that carries the biggest volume of the five North Sea crude oil streams. [O/R]

The deal gives the Swiss insurer the top spot in a market attractive to global players due to its robust economy and low penetration, while helping Australia’s No. 4 lender move ahead with a long-planned exit from non-core operations.

Zurich, Europe’s fifth-biggest insurer, also bought Macquarie Group Ltd’s (MQG.AX) life insurance unit for an undisclosed sum in 2016 and the Cover-More Group for $554 million in April. Together with its purchase of ANZ’s OnePath, it will now command 19 percent of Australia’s retail life insurance market.

As part of the agreement, it will also gain access to ANZ’s six million customers through a 20 year distribution agreement to sell life insurance.

The deal “provides a highly cash-generative business that will add to our cash remittances....and support dividend growth beyond that implied by our existing plan”, Zurich Chief Executive Mario Greco said in a statement.

It will increase cash flows by around $225 million over the 2017-2019 planning period, Zurich said, adding that the deal would be paid for with existing cash and senior debt.

The acquisition is the largest since Greco took over at Zurich last year. Brought in from Italy’s Generali (GASI.MI) to engineer a turnaround for the troubled group, Greco has promised to make Zurich leaner and more efficient.

ANZ’s sale comes amid a rush of divestments by Australia’s biggest banks, under pressure from more stringent capital requirements to slim down.

Banks are also seeking to get back to basics after a series of governance scandals, including one where Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) was accused of using outdated medical definitions to refuse life insurance payouts that resulted in a backlash against the whole sector.

“These non-core assets are causing a lot of core headaches,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer of Atlas Funds Management, which holds ANZ shares.

“What they’re concerned about is a bleeding over into their loan book.”

In September, Australia’s biggest lender Commonwealth Bank sold its life insurance unit to Hong Kong-based AIA (1299.HK) for $3.1 billion, while No. 3 lender National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) sold 80 percent of its life insurance unit to Japan’s Nippon Life Insurance last year.

ANZ Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliot said in a statement the bank’s strategy was to “do a few things and do them incredibly well” and that “we are just exiting, shrinking or partnering on everything else”.

The bank sold its pension business in October to Australian pension manager IOOF Holdings (IFL.AX) for A$975 million.

ANZ said it would book an extraordinary loss of about A$520 million from the sale of the life insurance business.

A medida, que gerou protestos da indústria de petróleo, foi tomada como contrapartida para que deputados desistissem de defender uma barreira para a adoção do Repetro, um regime aduaneiro diferenciado para o setor de petróleo e gás, durante a aprovação de uma Medida Provisória sobre o tema no Congresso em novembro.

Fruto da negociação, o governo prometeu apoiar um Projeto de Lei que contemplará uma demanda do setor de fornecimento de bens e serviços, que seria a adoção de percentuais mais específicos de conteúdo local, que desse menos margem para a fuga do compromisso, além da elevação de percentuais, explicou o vice-presidente da Abimaq, Cesar Prata.

“Já está colocada a proposta, já tem um projeto de lei, deve ser votado nesta semana e ele será uma compensação para a ausência de barreiras tarifárias dentro do Repetro”, disse Prata à Reuters, explicando que abrir mão das barreiras para o Repetro não foi uma decisão fácil.

De autoria dos deputados Jerônimo Goergen (PP-RS), Leonardo Quintão (PMDB-MG) e outros, o projeto ainda não foi apresentado. Mas uma versão final do documento, obtida pela Reuters com uma fonte próxima ao tema, mostra alterações de percentuais e definições de setores.

Em um dos principais pontos, o PL determina que para a fase de desenvolvimento da produção os índices de apuração de conteúdo local sejam estabelecidos separadamente para bens e para serviços.

Dessa forma, para blocos em terra, o texto propõe para a etapa de desenvolvimento da produção conteúdo local mínimo de 50 por cento para bens e de 50 por cento para serviços, ante a regra anterior que determinava percentual de 50 por cento sem especificar setores.

No caso de contratos para a fase de exploração de blocos em mar, seja regime de concessão, seja de partilha, o PL propõe diferentes percentuais de conteúdo local para construção de poço (25 por cento para serviços e 40 por cento para bens); sistema de coleta e escoamento (40 por cento para serviços e para bens); e plataformas (25 por cento para serviços e de 40 por cento).

No caso da fase de exploração, os percentuais de conteúdo local na proposta permanecem os mesmos: 18 por cento para blocos em mar e 50 por cento para blocos em terra.

O presidente do Instituto Brasileiro de Petróleo (IBP), Jorge Camargo, que representa petroleiras no Brasil como Petrobras e Shell, afirmou há Reuters que “é uma ideia absolutamente imprópria colocar em lei política de conteúdo local”.

“Política, como o próprio nome diz, é política. O governo legitimamente eleito tem todo o direito de fazer política”, disse Camargo, destacando que os percentuais antes eram aprovados pelo governo e aplicados em contratos pela Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP).

“Não é o instrumento adequado fazer uma lei de conteúdo local, e muito menos uma lei que ainda vai criar uma insegurança jurídica, porque conteúdo local é definido em contrato entre a ANP e o concessionário”, completou.

CONTRATOS FUTUROS

O movimento obrigou a Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) a adiar a publicação de uma resolução que iria permitir a adoção de regras mais flexíveis de conteúdo local para contratos antigos, prevista atualmente para até 13 de dezembro. [nL1N1K91N8] [nL1N1G723B]

A resolução também vai disciplinar pedidos de isenção de conteúdo local (“waiver”, no jargão do setor) e as transferências de excedente de conteúdo local, todos os mecanismos aplicáveis aos contratos da 7ª à 13ª Rodadas de Concessão, da 1ª Rodada de Partilha da Produção e da Cessão Onerosa.

“A ANP se sentiu preocupada de (publicar da resolução) e ir contra ao projeto de lei que será votado agora”, disse Cesar Prata, da Abimaq.

O diretor-geral da ANP, Décio Oddone, afirmou nesta segunda-feira de manhã a jornalistas que pediu ao Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU) uma extensão do prazo, para que possa obter do governo uma aprovação para elevar e detalhar os percentuais de conteúdo local para plataformas de produção de petróleo.

Os demais percentuais já anunciados anteriormente, segundo o diretor-geral, não sofreram alterações.

Em sua nova proposta, a ANP busca que as plataformas de produção tenham 40 por cento de conteúdo local para engenharia, 40 por cento para máquinas e equipamentos e 40 por cento em construção, integração e montagem.

Nos valores já aprovados pelo governo anteriormente, as plataformas teriam apenas um total de 25 por cento de conteúdo local global, sem um detalhamento de onde seriam aplicados. Essa regra recebeu fortes críticas da indústria, uma vez que não detalhava para onde iria o conteúdo local, dando margem para que as petroleiras o cumprissem apenas com serviços.

“A gente quer criar uma condição para que a indústria destrave, para que (isso aconteça) precisa ter uma resolução que tenha maior probabilidade de ser cumprida efetivamente”, disse Oddone, que afirmou ter a expectativa de que o TCU conceda uma extensão de quatro meses para a publicação.

Oddone explicou que a nova resolução permitirá que as empresas optem por aderir aos novos percentuais de conteúdo local ou manter as condições originais dos seus contratos. Caso optem por aderir, as companhias não poderão pedir “waiver” sobre o mesmo contrato.

Oddone, no entanto, evitou comentar durante a coletiva de imprensa a decisão tomada em Brasília sobre o projeto de lei ou sobre a validade da medida para futuros leilões.",Brasil deve exigir mais de petroleiras em troca de concessões no Repetro,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1E523B-OBRTP

Of the two options, the first would be far and away the best outcome for the British economy.
Yet the scope for increasing trade will run counter to the force of economic gravity.","Britain looks set to get what it craves in its negotiations with the European Union. The British government has contrived a way around the impasse over avoiding controls at the Irish land border and bowed to paying more or less what the EU was demanding as a divorce settlement. Now European leaders meeting at the summit of Dec. 14-15 are expected to authorize talks over the UK’s main priority: future trade arrangements.

Anti-Brexit protesters wave EU and UK flags outside the Houses of Parliament in London, November 14, 2017. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls

But just as the first phase of the negotiations has revealed Britain’s weak hand over the terms of its departure from the EU, so the next phase will reveal its weak hand in forging a favorable new economic relationship with the union.

Blame economic gravity for that. The larger and closer that economies are the more they trade with each other. The smaller and farther away that they are the less they trade with one another. This well-attested phenomenon explains the intensity of trade in services as well as in goods. That is a crucial reason why in 2016 Britain exported more in goods and services to small yet prosperous – and above all close – Ireland than to distant China, India and Brazil combined.

Economic gravity explains why leaving the EU is potentially so harmful for the British economy. Britain is set on a course that will hurt its trade with the world’s biggest trading bloc, which conveniently happens to be on its doorstep. Economic gravity also explains why it is unrealistic to expect new trade deals after Brexit with more distant and often poorer countries to compensate for the losses in trade with Europe.

British Prime Minister Theresa May insists that she is striving for a “deep and special partnership” with the EU. Unwrap the rhetoric and this is a more diplomatically packaged version of the Brexiter “having our cake and eating it” view of foreign secretary Boris Johnson, whose folly on this occasion was candor. Britain will leave the customs union, which it joined in 1973, creating new opportunities to strike supposedly lucrative trade deals with faster-growing parts of the world. The hope is that trade in goods with the EU will be as free and as frictionless as possible, while Britain’s key services sector will retain reasonable access to the single market that has removed regulatory barriers.

Unfortunately this Panglossian future will not be available. Michel Barnier, the EU’s formidable chief negotiator, has already given warning that Britain will face a choice between remaining in the single market on the same terms as Norway or a free-trade deal similar to that recently struck with Canada. Given that Barnier has just prevailed in the first stage of the talks the British government should heed what he says about the second.

Of the two options, the first would be far and away the best outcome for the British economy. Norway, Iceland and tiny Liechtenstein are outside the EU but belong together with the EU to the European Economic Area (EEA). That means the three countries are in the single market (excluding fisheries and agriculture) even though they are not part of the customs union, allowing them to strike their own trade deals (in general jointly with Switzerland) with other economies. Such an arrangement would minimize the damage to the British economy, though it would not go unscathed.

But May has already made clear that she is not prepared to go down this path because it would change Britain from being a rule maker through its influence and voting power within the EU decision-making institutions to becoming a rule taker. Moreover, a condition of remaining in the single market is accepting freedom of movement of people within the EEA, which would mean Brexit Britain could not “take back control” over migration.

That points to a free trade deal similar to the one between Canada and the EU though more ambitious: “Canada-plus.” The trouble is that any “plus” is unlikely to make up for the basic limitations of this model. Although the agreement does liberalize trade in goods it is inferior to Britain’s status within the customs union. More important, it offers much less for services, such as finance and air transport, which are Britain’s forte. A plausible Canada-plus deal where the plus is minimized at European insistence would be much more damaging for the economy than the EEA option.

Brexiters hope that any such harm will be offset through trade-creating deals with other countries once Britain is free again to negotiate them having left the customs union. Yet the scope for increasing trade will run counter to the force of economic gravity. Hopes for a resurgence in trade with members of the Commonwealth, for example – dubbed insensitively the “empire 2.0” strategy – will founder either because they are far away or their economies are small, or both.

Britain’s new freedom to negotiate trade deals with other countries will, in any case, come at a cost. Outside the EU it will have less clout, since the British economy is so much smaller than the bloc it is leaving. For example, Britain has gained new opportunities for its law firms from the EU’s trade agreement in 2011 with South Korea. But that concession formed part of an overall bargain in which the prize for South Korea was enhanced access to the EU-wide car market through the elimination of tariffs. And though British ministers talk up the prospects for a trade deal with the United States they and their negotiators would lack muscle in what would be a hard-nosed “America first” wrestling match.

Far from prospering through leaving the EU, Britain will be a lonelier and weaker economy. A transition period essentially sustaining the current economic relationship for around two years after the exit in March 2019 will give companies more time to adjust, but little else besides. After that, expect gravity to prevail.","Commentary: In Brexit Britain, economic gravity will take its toll",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-gravity-commentary/commentary-in-brexit-britain-economic-gravity-will-take-its-toll-idUSKBN1E52DB

The company’s shares, the best-performing Dow component this year with an 84 percent surge, were up 1.2 percent at $286.51 in after-market trading.

The world’s biggest maker of jetliners said the raised dividend and the new buyback program were not in response to a Republican tax overhaul, which seeks to cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent.

The latest reason for pessimism is Germany, which from being the undisputed leader of Europe has suddenly descended to being the basket case. The latest blow: Angela Merkel’s struggle to keep control of the government after her struggle to cobble together a new ruling coalition collapsed last weekend.

Merkel, a leader of apparent modesty and inexhaustible good sense, now must choose between another exhausting round of coalition negotiations, a minority government or fresh elections.

Meanwhile, Britain is leaving the European Union, and the vast task of disentangling nearly 45 years of unity at times seems beyond the UK’s weak Conservative government. But the people spoke in a referendum on Brexit, and no one can grab the wheel and turn the country around. Italy’s right, revived by gains in regional and local elections and leaning heavily towards the right, even far right and euro skepticism, is now the favorite to win a general election early next year.

Spain dismissed the government of Catalonia and rules it directly because the region – Spain’s richest – voted for independence in an unconstitutional referendum. Ironically, Madrid’s action will likely increase that very support for independence. In Poland, an increasingly authoritarian government headed by the Law and Justice Party now trades barbs daily with the EU – the latest salvo coming from European Council President Donald Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland.

And that’s just the larger countries. In the ranks of the middle and small members of the EU, matters are as bad — worse, in some cases. Belgium, according to some of its ministers, will cease to exist in less than a decade, split between the now largely autonomous Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Walloon (French-speaking) regions. Hungary, with the ruling Fidesz party buoyed by its adamant opposition to taking immigrants, now defies a European Court ruling that it must do so.

In Austria, coalition talks between the Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz and the far-right Freedom Party in Austria got off to a “very good start” last month. If they succeed, Kurz’s People’s Party and the Freedom Party will form a bloc hostile to immigration and skeptical of Brussels, certain to press for powers to return to the members’ capitals.

Parties in the Netherlands took seven months to cobble together a coalition which gives it a one-vote majority in parliament, and which is widely expected to fall apart in the next few months. In the Czech Republic – another member state which has refused to take in migrants – coalition talks got nowhere after the election last month, and the leader of the winning ANO party, Andrej Babis, has said he will form a minority government. Babis himself faces fraud charges over a 2 million euro ($2.36 million) EU subsidy, and any minority government is expected to bring political turmoil and no agreement on a budget.

To count a couple more ways, President Donald Trump, regarded everywhere in Europe as an unstoppably loose cannon, likes the EU no better than he ever did, and thus will not help countries accustomed to being called the United States’ closest allies; they must learn to fend for themselves. The EU’s hostility to Russia – amply reciprocated, boosted by the seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea and continued sponsorship of the anti-government rebels in the eastern Donbas area – remains an untreated, and apparently untreatable, sore.

And thus to Germany, the moderate port in the storm of turbulence, led by a woman lauded at home and respected abroad. But this week in Germany, the popular tabloid Bild is screaming from the newsstands – “How long can Merkel Stay in Power?” The centrist paper of record, the Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung, ran an incendiary interview with the leader of the socially liberal Free Democratic Party Christian Lindner – which walked out of the coalition talks on Monday.

Merkel’s conservative CDU-CSU coalition won the most parliamentary seats in the September elections, but its heavy loss of support from its previous numbers forces it to seek unlikely coalition partners. The social democratic SPD, itself greatly reduced, saw continuing a coalition with Merkel as a recipe for more decline – although it now says it will return if its members give their consent. Merkel has tried, in past weeks, to cobble together a government with the pro-business FDP and the leftish Greens, both of which increased their vote substantially in the national vote. The weekend breakdown threw the country’s politics into crisis; everywhere in Europe, the leading state’s floundering was seen as more poisonous to the union than any of the other ills now besetting it.

European nerves may be over-strained. A case can be made that German politics need a shake-up, and that a second election – Merkel’s preferred alternative if SPD members reject another coalition – will produce a renewed polity.

It may. It may also produce – and this is the fear of liberal Germans, left and right – a stronger Alternativ fur Deutschland, the far-right party which surged from no representation in the Bundestag to the country’s third-largest party. It is violently against immigration, and in the election campaign marked that most powerfully with a poster showing a white, heavily pregnant German woman with the slogan – “New Germans? We make them ourselves!”

With such divisions, Germany does not just face a season of choppy politics; it threatens to head out of the zone which its politics have occupied for most of the post-war period. That is, an agreement that the center will hold, and that anti-fascism is an attitude shared by all, part of the fabric of German society, its re-entry into the democratic world.

It points to something else too. The European Union, in its negotiations with the UK on Brexit, presents itself as a united bloc of 27 dealing, reluctantly and severely, with an errant 28th. In fact, it is a Union in urgent need of frank talking, of confrontation with its own inner and outer weaknesses and challenges, and evident incapacity to move to a more closely integrated bloc, let alone a federation.

The present decline of Germany may be brief, since the country remains the most successful economy in Europe, and one of the best governed. Merkel remains the most popular politician, and her reputation for rational, careful government is well deserved. She has promised the EU that Germany continues to have a government committed to the union.

But the latest developments should prompt reflection and action. If the ever-closer union is a chimera, what form of union is sensible for the 21st century? And when one can be imagined, and agreed, a new framework for a diverse Europe, no longer straining after a presently impossible dream, should be brought into being.",Commentary: What Merkel’s political woes mean for the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-germany-commentary/commentary-what-merkels-political-woes-mean-for-the-eu-idUSKBN1DO24W

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.

The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP.

Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.

Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.

“The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”

Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.

Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.

The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.

VOLATILITY CONCERNS

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

Bidding for a hat-trick of titles in Europe’s elite club competition, Real paid a heavy price for not winning their group as they were drawn with the big-spending Parisians who were tipped as many people’s favourites ahead of the draw in Nyon.

Five-times champions Barcelona will face English champions Chelsea, one of five Premier league clubs in the draw.

Tottenham Hotspur, who topped their group ahead of Real Madrid thanks to a 3-1 victory at Wembley, will face Serie A champions and last seasons’ runners-up Juventus.

Manchester City, who clocked up a record 14th successive Premier League victory on Sunday, are now listed as favourites after being handed a last-16 clash with Swiss club Basel.

Five-times winners Bayern Munich, who finished below PSG in the group, will be happy with a two-legged clash with Turkish outsiders Besiktas.

Europa League champions Manchester United take on Sevilla while, Liverpool will meet Porto while AS Roma’s reward for winning their group ahead of Chelsea is a tricky tie against Ukraine’s Shakhtar Donetsk.

The Champions League has proved beyond even the vast riches available to PSG and last season they were stunned in the last 16 by Barcelona, losing the second leg 6-1 after beating the Spanish side 4-0 in the French capital.

A clash with Real is hardly what they would have desired at such an early stage but with Neymar and Edinson Cavani having scored six goals apiece in the group, they will be hopeful -- if they can keep Real’s nine-goal Cristiano Ronaldo quiet.

“This could have been the final, given the power of the two clubs. The last 16 is a bit early, we could say. Logically we are both challengers for the trophy,” Emilio Butragueno, Real’s director of institutional relations, said following the draw.

“PSG get stronger and stronger, they had an impeccable group phase and have a lot of power. I don’t think it’s a good draw for them either. It will be a thrilling tie.”

PSG and real have played six times in Europe, most recently in the 2015-16 group stage when the sides drew 0-0 in Paris with Real edging the return match 1-0.

Chelsea and Barcelona will renew a regular Champions league rivalry that last surfaced in the 2012 semi-final when Chelsea won 3-2 on aggregate before going on to claim the trophy for the only time in their history.

Barcelona won the 2009 semi-final on away goals.

“We’ve had some great times at Stamford Bridge, haven’t we?” Barca’s Andres Iniesta said on Twitter.

While Antonio Conte’s Chelsea were handed a tough draw, the other English qualifiers would have been reasonably content with their opponents, especially Manchester City.

While Basel are a formidable side at home and have some big English scalps at home in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola’s side will be big favourites to progress.

“We cannot ignore the multitude of women who have come forward with accusations against Mr. Trump,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter, though a formal inquiry was unlikely to result because Republicans control the agenda in Congress.

The letter, spearheaded by the Democratic women’s working group, which is composed of all the party’s female members in the House, was signed by 56 lawmakers. It followed a call earlier on Monday by three women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct for a congressional investigation into his behavior.

The lawmakers’ request for a probe was sent to leaders of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the main investigative committee in the House.

Over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them in the years before he entered politics. Monday’s letter from the Democrats said there were at least 17 accusers and listed names.

“The president’s own remarks appear to back up the allegations,” the letter said, saying Trump had boasted “that he feels at liberty to perpetrate such conduct against women.”

“The president should be allowed to present evidence in his own defense,” said the lawmakers.

The letter was addressed to oversight panel Chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican, and top Democrat Elijah Cummings.

Trump last year apologized for talking about groping women in a 2005 tape recording that surfaced weeks before the presidential election, and said he had not done the things he talked about.

More recently, Trump has told allies that the voice on the recording was not his, The New York Times reported recently.

Trump and White House officials have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against him, some of which date back to the 1980s.

Trade officials from the two countries and the EU will make a joint statement on the sidelines of the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, aligning to address the overcapacity issue, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks on the issue were continuing.

It was unclear whether China would be specifically named in the statement.

Washington, Brussels and Tokyo have raised complaints about China’s subsidies to state-owned enterprises, state financing and investment rules that often force foreign firms to transfer strategic technologies. They argue that such distortions have fueled rampant overcapacity in key industries such as steel and aluminum that are flooding global markets and forcing layoffs elsewhere.

The United States has sided with the EU in arguing that the WTO should not grant China market economy status, a move that would severely weaken Western trade defenses.

On Monday, Japanese Trade and Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko voiced support for efforts to strengthen WTO transparency and reporting standards - a U.S. initiative largely aimed at exposing illegal Chinese subsidies.

“Free trade only works when we secure fair conditions for competition,” Seko said in remarks to WTO colleagues. “Fair market conditions must not be negatively affected by measures such as market-distorting subsidies, forced technology transfer, infringement of intellectual property rights and unfair trade practices by state-owned enterprises.”

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in remarks to colleagues, said some members were “intentionally circumventing” their obligations and seeking unfair concessions through litigation, causing the WTO to lose its trade negotiation focus.

The Financial Times reported that the joint statement would also target China’s intellectual property practices, including requirements that require firms turn technology over to local joint-venture partners.

With Trump’s “America First” trade agenda casting a cloud over the WTO’s 11th ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, representatives of other major members criticized protectionism and advocated a stronger multilateral trading system, while acknowledging the WTO’s shortcomings.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has said he does not want major agreements out of the meeting, voiced concern that the WTO was becoming a litigation-centered organization.

“Too often members seem to believe they can gain concessions through lawsuits that they could never get at the negotiating table,” he said. “We have to ask ourselves whether this is good for the institution and whether the current litigation structure makes sense.”

Too many countries were not following WTO rules, he complained, and too many wealthier members had been given unfair exemptions as developing countries.

“We need to clarify our understanding of development within the WTO. We cannot sustain a situation in which new rules can only apply to a few and that others will be given a pass in the name of self-proclaimed development status,” Lighthizer told the conference’s opening session.

He said five of the six richest countries claim developing country status at the WTO, without providing evidence to back up the assertion. A Lighthizer spokeswoman later said he was referring to the six countries with the highest gross domestic product per capita, according to International Monetary Fund measurements.

Ahead of the meeting, the United States blocked efforts to draft a joint statement emphasizing the “centrality” of the global trade system and the need to aid development. Its opposition has raised concerns that the WTO will not be able to accomplish even modest goals, such as addressing fishing and agricultural subsidies, at the conference.

“We need to have a clear objective in mind,” European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said. “For the European Union, this is clear: to preserve and to strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system.”

SWIPES AT CHINA

Trump has indicated his preference for bilateral deals over the multilateral system embodied by the WTO. The United States has vetoed new judges for trade disputes, pushing the organization into a crisis.

Several countries’ delegates criticized that delay on Monday, without mentioning the United States. South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong, whose resignation as a WTO appellate judge this year created one of the openings, said members should “promptly fill all the vacancies.”

“We need to collectively and expeditiously resolve this impasse,” Indian Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu told the conference.

Lighthizer said it was impossible to negotiate new rules when many of the current ones were not being followed, and added that too many members viewed exemptions from WTO rules as a path to faster growth.

In a thinly veiled swipe at China’s trade practices, Lighthizer said the United States was leading negotiations to “correct the sad performance of many members in notification and transparency.”

Japan’s Trade and Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko said Japan would support efforts to boost reporting standards.

The United States is backing the EU in its resistance to recognizing China as a market economy, arguing the government unfairly intervenes in the economy. The case is before the WTO and a victory for Beijing could dramatically lower tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Zimbabwe military’s slow-motion, week-long, eviction of the man who has ruled that landlocked southern African state for its entire 37 years of existence as an independent nation, came to an abrupt and almost banal end on Tuesday night. After a week of determined resistance, President Robert Mugabe suddenly folded his hand and resigned with immediate effect, by means of a letter read out in the nation’s Parliament, just as impeachment proceedings were starting.

On a continent that often has been wracked by violent coups d’état, this had been a most unusual military intervention. For different reasons, everyone, on all sides, took pains to avoid any suggestion that this was a coup.

When the tanks last week swept into the capital city of Harare and soldiers took control of key installations, the nature of what had happened seemed simple: a forced change of power, accomplished in this case at the cost of the death of a single ministerial bodyguard, and with the 93-year-old Mugabe and his 52-year-old wife, Grace, placed under house arrest. That’s a textbook coup.

The military’s actions followed within days of Mugabe firing Deputy President Emmerson Mnangagwa, seemingly to clear the way for the widely despised Grace – known disparagingly as Gucci Grace for reports of her profligacy – to succeed him when he eventually relinquished control. Mnangagwa, who bears the nickname of Crocodile for his canny ruthlessness, and who was Mugabe’s lifelong friend and ally, fled to neighboring South Africa.

“We wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover,” were among the first words of Major General SB Moyo in the post-takeover statement read on television to a riveted nation. Rather, the military was targeting “criminals” around President Mugabe “who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country.”

The sensitivity to semantics on the part of the Zimbabwean generals stems from the 55-nation African Union, the continent’s over-arching intergovernmental body, taking an increasingly hard line against illegal changes of government. Alpha Conde, chair of the AU and president of Guinea, was initially forthright on what had happened: the action was “clearly soldiers trying to take power by force” and he warned that the AU would “never accept a coup d’état in Zimbabwe.”

The AU is, however, alert also to the diplomatic fallout that would result from thwarting the popular ousting of a man seen by many Zimbabweans as a despot who has long since lost the luster he acquired while leading a liberation army in the long civil war to end white minority rule. Almost a quarter of Zimbabwe’s 16-million population has in the past decade fled the country as economic and political refugees, the majority of them to South Africa.

The reaction from the populace was at first muted. Perhaps they were scenting the political winds, trying to establish whether the same military that had so often in the past intervened to beat them to pulp when they dared vote for the opposition and which in the 1980s had killed 20,000 civilians in protracted massacre of its political opponents, was indeed proffering it the keys to its prison.

By the weekend, suspicion had turned to unbridled optimism. More than 100,000 Zimbabweans of all races assembled for peaceful demonstrations throughout the country to celebrate the ousting of Mugabe. Opposition groupings expressed guarded approval of the military’s actions, with the caveat that there should be a cross-party process of democratization, free elections and an end to the flouting of human rights.

Faced with what now seemed might be a popular uprising, in the style of the Arab Spring that in 2010 transformed the political landscape of North Africa and the Middle East, the AU changed tack and expressed confidence that that a solution would be found within “constitutional legality.” It quickly passed the political hot potato to the 15-nation Southern African Development Community, the regional intergovernmental cooperative body currently chaired by South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma.

On Sunday, Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party fired Mugabe as its leader and recalled him from the presidency. They also issued an ultimatum that were he not to resign by noon on Monday, impeachment procedures would be started immediately.

The strangest defender of the legality of these actions by the military turned out to be Mugabe himself. When on Sunday he appeared on state television, ostensibly to resign, he said that the “military operation” was motivated by “a deep patriotic concern for the stability of the nation” and did “not amount to a threat to our well-cherished constitutional order.”

Whatever delight those words by Mugabe would have afforded the military, in that they effectively immunized the presidential overthrow against any AU intervention, the pleasure was short-lived. Departing from the script apparently agreed to by Mugabe and the stony-faced generals seated on the podium with him, Mugabe did not resign, but instead insisted in a long and rambling address that the necessary corrective actions would be undertaken under his oversight.

It is not clear why Mugabe reneged on an agreement which supposedly included assurances that he and his family would not face any legal actions relating to his presidency, nor would he have to return any of the billions of dollars that they have accumulated during his office. Whether or not it was incipient senility, as many assume, it ironically benefited the opposition – for Zanu-PF would need opposition parliamentary support to impeach the president.

It’s now a moot point. Mugabe has resigned “voluntarily … to ensure the smooth transfer of power” and opposition co-operation – which would have come at the cost of Zanu-PF agreeing to a democratization timetable – is no longer needed. Mnangagwa, the Crocodile, who has a violent and controversial political past, will succeed him “within 48 hours,” says Zanu-PF.

The coup that was not a coup took a week. It will take longer for Zimbabweans to find out whether their jubilation at the unexpected transformation of their onetime oppressors to uniformed liberators will be vindicated or dashed. But as one said to me, “When you have been waiting so long, the replacement of Mugabe with Devil himself is an improvement. It opens the door to change. And change has its own momentum.”

The U.S. president is no friend to the global trade body, which is hunkering down for its biennial confab. Reforms are needed but America has won most of its complaints, including against China.

Trump’s trade chief Robert Lighthizer will emphasize national sovereignty over multilateralism at meetings in Buenos Aires this week. His push for WTO reforms and fair trade policies has tamped down expectations for this year’s gathering, when reducing agricultural subsidies is on the agenda. During his presidential campaign, Trump threatened to pull out of the WTO and has repeatedly said the United States has been treated unfairly.

Yet America, the most frequent WTO complainant, has won more than 90 percent of the cases it has brought over the last 20 years. China has been a frequent target. In 2015, China eliminated quotas for rare earths used in mobile phones after the WTO declared the system violated trade policies. The United States followed up with a complaint against Chinese quotas on raw materials used in the steel and auto industries.

The Trump administration is also undermining the WTO’s dispute-settlement system by blocking the appointment of new judges for its seven-member appellate body. With another judge’s term ending this month, the panel will go down to four members, with three of them needed to decide cases. That could slow down U.S. cases, such as a complaint on Chinese quotas on wheat, rice and corn advocated by American farmers.

Lighthizer has a point in calling for the WTO to change. The unwieldy body has not been able to update global trade rules since the mid-1990s. America has also lost 90 percent of cases when it’s a complaint defendant, but that’s because it often doesn’t adhere to rulings, spurring multiple decisions on the same issue. In one case, the United States declined to address cotton subsidies for 10 years after a 2004 WTO ruling.

China’s WTO membership also hasn’t stopped it from dumping steel and other products. But Beijing tends to adhere to WTO rulings, making it at least somewhat effective in curbing unfair trade practices. Trump’s weakening of the body has consequences for U.S. business, too.",Breakingviews - Trump’s anti-WTO rhetoric hurts America first,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-breakingviews/breakingviews-trumps-anti-wto-rhetoric-hurts-america-first-idUSKBN1E52FE

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, took his own case to Egypt on Monday and was expected to fly to Turkey for a meeting of Muslim countries this week, cementing support from leaders who say the U.S. move was a dire error.

President Donald Trump announced last Wednesday the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, breaking with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city’s status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a rocket into Israel and the Israeli military said it responded with air strikes and tank fire targeting a position of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the enclave.

On the ground in the Palestinian territories, violent clashes with Israeli security forces in which scores of Palestinians have been injured and several killed since the U.S. announcement last week appeared to have mostly subsided.

Netanyahu, on his first visit to EU headquarters in Brussels, said Trump’s move helped peace, “because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace”.

Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war, considers the entire city to be its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

The Trump administration says it remains committed to the peace process and its decision does not affect Jerusalem’s future borders or status. It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.

But even Israel’s closest European allies have rejected that logic and say recognizing Israel’s capital unilaterally risks inflaming violence and further wrecking the chance for peace.

After a breakfast meeting between Netanyahu and EU foreign ministers, Sweden’s top diplomat said no European at the closed-door meeting had voiced support for Trump’s decision, and no country was likely to follow the United States in announcing plans to move its embassy.

“I have a hard time seeing that any other country would do that and I don’t think any other EU country will do it,” Margot Wallstrom told reporters.

Israel’s position does appear to have more support from some EU states than others. Last week, the Czech foreign ministry said it would begin considering moving the Czech Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while Hungary blocked a planned EU statement condemning the U.S. move.

But Prague later said it accepted Israel’s sovereignty only over West Jerusalem, and Budapest said its long-term position seeking a two-state solution in the Middle East had not changed.

On Monday, Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said of Trump’s decision: “I‘m afraid it can’t help us.”

“I‘m convinced that it is impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution,” Zaoralek said. “We are talking about an Israeli state but at the same time we have to speak about a Palestinian state.”

The Palestinian president, Abbas, met Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Cairo, as well as the head of the Arab League. Egypt, a U.S. ally with a peace treaty with Israel, has brokered Israeli-Palestinian deals in the past.

“DUNGEON FOR MUSLIMS”

Moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem would have “dangerous effects on peace and security in the region”, Sisi said on Monday at an earlier meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Abbas was also due to fly to Turkey. Trump’s announcement has triggered a war of words between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Netanyahu, straining ties between the two U.S. allies which were restored only last year after a six-year breach that followed the Israeli storming of a Turkish aid ship.

On Sunday, Erdogan called Israel a “terror state”. Netanyahu responded by saying he would accept no moral lectures from Erdogan who he accused of bombing Kurdish villages, jailing opponents and supporting terrorists.

On Monday Erdogan took aim directly at Washington over Trump’s move: “The ones who made Jerusalem a dungeon for Muslims and members of other religions will never be able to clean the blood from their hands,” he said in a speech in Ankara. “With their decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United States has become a partner in this bloodshed.”

Trump’s announcement triggered days of protests across the Muslim world and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

In Beirut, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest at a march backed by Hezbollah, the heavily-armed Iran-backed Shi‘ite group whose leader called last week for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel. An announcer led the crowd in chants of “Death to America! Death to Israel!”

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah told the crowd by video link the group was turning its focus back toward the fight against Israel: “Today the axis of resistance, including Hezbollah, will return as its most important priority ... Jerusalem and Palestine and the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance in all its factions.”

“STOP PAMPERING”

Netanyahu, who has been angered by the EU’s search for closer business ties with Iran, said Europeans should emulate Trump’s move and press the Palestinians to do so, too.

“It’s time that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state and also recognize the fact that it has a capital. It’s called Jerusalem,” he said. In comments filmed later on his plane, he said he had told the Europeans to “stop pampering the Palestinians”, who “need a reality check”.

The decision to recognize Jerusalem could also strain Washington’s ties with another of its major Muslim allies, Saudi Arabia, which has sought closer relations with Washington under Trump than under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Saudi Arabia shares U.S. and Israeli concerns about the increasing regional influence of Iran, and was seen as a potential broker for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal. But Saudis have suggested that unilateral decisions over Jerusalem make any such rapprochement more difficult.

Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States and veteran ex-security chief, published a strongly-worded open letter to Trump on Monday.

“Bloodshed and mayhem will definitely follow your opportunistic attempt to make electoral gain,” the prince wrote in the letter, published in the Saudi newspaper al-Jazeera.

“Your action has emboldened the most extreme elements in the Israeli society ... because they take your action as a license to evict the Palestinians from their lands and subject them to an apartheid state,” he added. “Your action has equally emboldened Iran and its terrorist minions to claim that they are the legitimate defenders of Palestinian rights.”

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.

The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP.

Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.

Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.

“The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”

Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.

Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.

The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.

VOLATILITY CONCERNS

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

While both Seoul and Beijing share the goal of getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two neighbors have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.

China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tensions with North Korea.

At his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this year on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea’s agreement with China in late October the two would normalize all exchanges and move past the year-long spat over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two.

The THAAD dispute had dented South Korea’s economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were canceled.

While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea’s decision to deploy it.

In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD’s presence is inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.

“South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China’s security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,” Moon said.

Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have “good results” if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, he added.

Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have “friendly cooperation” with China, and that China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula.

In its latest missile provocation, Pyongyang test-launched what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it continues its mission to create a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the United States.

During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses partaking in the four-day visit.

Neither of the partners gave details of the business ventures which might arise from their non-binding memorandum of understanding.

The Saudi government announced on Monday that the first theaters could start showing films as early as March, part of a liberalizing reform drive that has opened the door to concerts, comedy shows and women drivers in the past year.

The consensus from Washington to Tokyo is that lower levies stimulate innovation and job growth. Yet President Moon Jae-in’s move to crank up taxes on the highest-earning companies makes eminent sense. Asia’s fourth-largest economy is so unbalanced, it needs socialist redistribution to transform its capitalism.

The logo of the Bank of Korea is seen in Seoul, South Korea, November 30, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

South Korea has the second-highest level of overall inequality among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This is mostly a result of a dominant handful of family-owned industrial groups, or chaebol; Samsung, for example, generates around a fifth of the country’s GDP. This group hogs capital and starves innovative startups. It also collectively holds down wage growth, suppressing consumption, which keeps the economy over-dependent on exports to undependable trading partners like China and the United States.

The $390 billion budget makes a down-payment on disrupting this. It includes a 16.4 percent hike to the minimum wage, the biggest adjustment since 2001. It adds about 9,500 public sector jobs and extends aid to small companies that need help covering the new wage mandate. It will be funded in part by hiking corporate taxes to 25 percent from 22 percent on companies with income exceeding $273 million per year. That will impact roughly 77 companies, including Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor. There is pushback, as expected: the Federation of Korean Industries is lobbying lawmakers to head off further changes.

But more needs to be done. Parts of this budget pander to the left-wing base, and will have little reform impact. Creating government jobs for underemployed youth, for example, makes for easy politics but won’t upgrade competitiveness. It’s going to be much harder to get the private sector to add staff. Moon still has a long reform checklist in hand: discouraging incestuous cross-shareholding structures; taxing excess corporate cash reserves better spent fattening paychecks; stepping up antitrust enforcement and lowering takeover defences to make industrial rationalisation easier. And so on.

It’s grand that Moon’s “trickle-up economics” plan, standing in such stark contrast to U.S. President Donald Trump’s approach, has gotten underway. But leveling the playing field for 51 million Koreans and creating more grassroots growth will take a lot more work.",Breakingviews - Seoul's contrarian tax hike makes for good start,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-economy-budget-breakingvie/breakingviews-seouls-contrarian-tax-hike-makes-for-good-start-idUSKBN1E20DC

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson discussed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case with Iranian officials after flying to Tehran over the weekend to try to seek her release.

“One of the issues that Johnson brought up in Tehran was the issue of Ms. Zaghari,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi was quoted by state media as saying.

“With regard to her dual nationality, from our point of view of course she is Iranian and she has been sentenced by the judiciary and she will serve the period of her sentence.”

Britain says Zaghari-Ratcliffe was visiting family on holiday in April 2016 when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government.

Johnson said he urged the release of dual nationals.

“I urged their release, on humanitarian grounds, where there is cause to do so,” Johnson told the British parliament.

“These are complex cases involving individuals considered by Iran to be their own citizens, and I do not wish to raise false hopes. But my meetings in Tehran were worthwhile,” he said. “It is too early to be confident about the outcome.”

Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but her case has taken on political significance in Britain after Johnson said last month that she had been teaching journalists in Iran, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized.

Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison.

Qassemi said the Iranian foreign ministry would follow up on Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case but said that it was ultimately a matter for the judiciary.

A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges.

The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.

Johnson also said he raised with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif what he called “the official harassment of journalists working for BBC Persian and their families inside Iran.”

The BBC has called on Iran to reverse a court order which it said effectively froze the non-liquid assets of 152 staff, former staff and contributors in Iran.",Iran will treat jailed aid worker as Iranian citizen: foreign ministry,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-iran/iran-will-treat-jailed-aid-worker-as-iranian-citizen-foreign-ministry-idUKKBN1E51XZ

Secondo quanto riferiscono fonti governative e vicine al dossier, che confermano indiscrezioni del fine settimana, Eurostat avrebbe messo in questione lo status di Cdp, il cui bilancio non incide sul debito pubblico perché è fuori dal perimetro della pubblica amministrazione.

In genere, su richiesta di un governo, Eurostat è chiamata a verificare se una privatizzazione di questo genere avviene in condizioni di mercato, se in sostanza il prezzo che pagherebbe Cdp sia in linea con quanto pagherebbe un acquirente privato.

Il programma di privatizzazioni, secondo fonti, prevede che entro fine anno il Tesoro venda a Cdp il 50,37% di Enav e gran parte del 4,34% posseduto in Eni, con incassi stimabili in 2,5/3 miliardi di euro. Il target governativo per il 2017 prevede incassi pari allo 0,2% del Pil cioè, poco meno di 3,5 miliardi.

Le fonti parlano ora di contatti informali con Eurostat e di un parere della Banca d‘Italia sull‘ipotizzata cessione, che mette in guardia dal rischio di vedere incluse le passività di Cdp nel debito pubblico, visto nel 2017 al 131,6% del Pil.

Una delle fonti parla di situazione in divenire e si mostra fiduciosa su una soluzione positiva in tempi brevi.

Alla richiesta di un commento, un funzionario di Eurostat dice di non aver fornito alcuna opinione al governo italiano e che le indiscrezioni giornalistiche sono speculazioni su ciò che potrebbe dire.

Non è stato possibile per il momento avere un commento da Banca d‘Italia.

Il Tesoro usa da anni Cdp come braccio finanziario per mettere a segno dismissioni del patrimonio pubblico.

Dal 2012 sono state trasferiti a Cassa, oltre a immobili pubblici per centinaia di milioni, le società Sace, Fintecna e Simest e, da ultimo , il 35% di Poste italiane.

What’s gone wrong?

Of the few in power, only the Portuguese socialists presently enjoy strong ratings. The Swedish social democrats regularly poll fewer than 30 percent and lead a minority government in coalition with the Greens. The Luxembourg Socialist Workers Party is a junior partner in a center-right-led coalition. In Malta, the EU’s smallest state, Labour is in power, but not held in high esteem after Daphne Caruana Galizia, the investigative journalist killed in October, reported extensively on charges of corruption involving Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and his allies. (Muscat has denied all allegations and said he “will not rest before justice is done” for the “barbaric act” of Galizia’s murder.)

In Italy, the only large European state with a center-left government, the Partito Democratico, suffered a bad defeat in the Sicilian regional elections earlier this month. The right-wing coalition, led by the never-say-dead Silvio Berlusconi, won convincingly. National elections are expected in the spring of next year.

In former communist states, the center-leftists frequently shift leaders and make alliances with centrists or even far rightists. The Estonian Social Democrats are junior partners in the ruling center-right coalition. The Romanian Social Democrats fired their own prime minister, Sorin Grindeanu, earlier this year after he tried to decriminalize some forms of corruption, and several other cabinet ministers resigned last month – though the party remains in power. In Slovakia, the social democrats lead a shifting and crisis-prone coalition after losing their parliamentary majority in 2016 elections.

Elsewhere, the leftist parties – the Austrian, Croatian, Cypriot, Czech, Danish, Finnish, German, Latvian and Lithuanian social democrats, the British, Dutch, Irish and Norwegian labor parties, the Bulgarian, French and Hungarian socialists, the Spanish Socialist Workers Party – find winning ever harder. In the cases of the French socialists, Greek PASOK and Dutch Labour Party, single-figure rankings in the polls make even survival a stretch.

Meanwhile, far-right parties are seeing an upsurge in support. The German federal elections drew most comment for the sudden success of the far-right Alternativ fur Deutschland (AfD) and the surprising weakness of the governing CDU/CSU centre right coalition. But the much greater fragility of Germany’s social democrats, with an historic low of just over 20 percent of the vote, is at least as momentous. This, apparently the most stable, most powerful, best socially-integrated center-left party in the world, hemorrhaged voters to the populist Linke (Left) Party and even more to the AfD.

Since the war, social democratic parties offered capitalism a deal. The state would be largely responsible for public welfare and education, and organized labor would – in varying degrees – be granted strong bargaining rights, even co-determination in enterprises. The internal, mostly unstated, agreement within the social democratic movements was that the unions would deliver the bulk of their members’ votes to the party. Capitalism would be regulated, but could be successful – as it usually was.

As the post war decades rolled on, the social democratic end of the deal softened, if at different times in different ways. Social democracy, once ambiguous about capitalism, came to work with and depend on it. In Britain, France, Germany and Italy, parties which had once embraced socialism (in Italy’s case, communism) clawed away from commitment to nationalization, ever-higher public expenditure and any form of class struggle. Both the United States under the Democrat president Bill Clinton and Germany under the SPD’s Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in the 1990s and after, adopted elements of British New Labour’s “Third Way,” essentially a new form of adaptation to capital in its more globalized form, but with relatively high public spending and liberal social policies as part of the bargain.

As globalization accelerated, social democrats came to believe that they must rival governments of the right in attracting investment and encouraging entrepreneurship. But the decline of national protections helped eviscerate much of organized labor (except in the public services) and rendered the institutions of the welfare state more fragile because more open to domestic and international competition.

Social democracy’s success in representing the organized working class and attracting a substantial slice of middle class votes depended on the influence it could bring to bear on national corporations, and national governments. Union power was reduced when faced with global corporations; the left lost one of its most powerful cards. Social democrats and liberals also lose out in their response to escalating fear of terrorism, especially in France, and the gathering rejection of immigrants in all European states.

The center-left – especially the UK’s New Labour in the mid 2000s and the Swedish social democrats in 2015-16 – had tended to be more liberal in allowing mass immigration to their countries. All now are rowing back to harsher positions, but the damage with electorates is done, at least for some time. The political philosopher Ivan Krastev writes that “the refugee crisis has dramatically changed the nature of democratic politics on the national level (prompting)… a voters’ rebellion against the meritocratic elites.” Working and lower middle class are strongly represented among these “rebellious” voters.

As global capitalism comes to be blamed increasingly for austerity, inequality, stagnant incomes and unemployment, and parties of the right fear something like a revolution, parts of electorates, especially the young, turn away from parties which are seen as little different from the center right, powerless in the face of global pressures and less militant and aggressive in pursuing alternatives. They turn to the Jeremy Corbyn-led UK Labour Party and Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France Insoumise. At the same time, those who focus on migrants and terrorism often find a new home in far right groups such as the Swedish Democrats, the AfD and France’s National Front, a powerful if internally divided force that won a record 34 percent of the vote in the final runoff of the French presidential election earlier this year.

That full-blooded socialism has failed wherever it has been tried and that the parties of the far right lean far towards authoritarian rule and a deliberate cultivation of fear and hatred has not yet severely dented the attraction of the parties of the two extremes. Thus the weakening of social democracy continues. It has lost its foundations and has not yet found its relevance to 21st century politics.",Commentary: Why social democrats have become irrelevant,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-politics-commentary/commentary-why-social-democrats-have-become-irrelevant-idUSKBN1DH27O

The suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, was taken to a hospital after suffering burns from the explosive device, which was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties and did not fully ignite, officials said. Investigators told Reuters they believe the attack in midtown Manhattan was intended to be a suicide bombing.

The blast, which occurred around 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) in a busy underground passageway between the subway station underneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square subway station, sent commuters fleeing for the exits and police officers rushing to the scene, as officials scrambled to reroute trains and shut down streets.

Three people, including a police officer, suffered minor injuries.

The attack came just six weeks after police say an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians along a bike path in lower Manhattan, killing eight in an act for which Islamic State later claimed responsibility. In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood.

In recent years, numerous people claiming to be inspired by Islamic State have carried out attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States.

A law enforcement official familiar with the Ullah investigation said investigators have found evidence that he watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet.

‘AMATEUR-LEVEL’

The weapon used in Monday’s attack was “amateur-level,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference near the explosion site. He told CNN the homemade bomb may not have fully ignited, possibly limiting the damage.

Officials said the attempted bombing underscored New York City’s status as a target for such attacks, citing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people in all, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.

“Let’s be clear, as New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. “And let’s also be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack.”

In a statement, President Donald Trump said the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.

“America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,” he said.

The president also criticized the visa program that allowed Ullah to enter the United States in 2011 because he had family members already in the country, saying such family visas are “incompatible with national security.”

Ullah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, said Shameem Ahsan, consul general of Bangladesh in New York.

Authorities did not immediately comment on Ullah’s motives. When asked whether Ullah had claimed any connection to Islamic State, New York Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said, “He did make statements but we’re not going to talk about that right now.”

Several U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no immediate information indicating Ullah was previously known to any American spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militants or terrorism, though a connection could still be found.

Ullah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country’s police chief. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.

Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver’s license from 2012 to 2015, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.

Monday’s incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in a long tunnel that connects sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso.

‘EVERYBODY WAS SCARED’

The explosion turned a normal start to the work week into a chaotic scene.

“There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,” said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. “Everybody was scared and running and shouting.”

The bus terminal was temporarily closed, and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway travel was disrupted but later returned to normal.

In December, New York experiences a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store window displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows.

More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city’s busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Ten train lines stop at the station.

The bus terminal is the busiest in the United States, according to the Port Authority. On a typical weekday, about 220,000 passengers arrive or depart on more than 7,000 buses.

The bus terminal is adjacent to and above the subway station’s western section. A long, narrow underground tunnel connects that part of the station to its eastern section, and is used by thousands of commuters during rush hour.

The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening stock markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries.

Technology and energy stocks closed higher Monday, helping Wall Street shake off uncertainties following the explosion.","Subway bomber wounds self, three victims in New York",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1E51EI

Embora os contratos futuros de bitcoin já fossem oferecidos em alguns bolsas não regulamentas fora dos Estados Unidos, o lançamento na bolsa Cboe Global Markets em Chicago marca a primeira vez em que os investidores podem obter exposição ao mercado por meio de uma das principais bolsas regulamentadas.

A estreia na noite de domingo pode ter causado uma interrupção no site Cboe, que informou que devido ao tráfego intenso o site “pode estar temporariamente indisponível”.

O contrato futuro de bitcoin de um mês começou a ser negociado às 21:00 (horário de Brasília) a 15.460 dólares e atingiu a máxima de 18.700 dólares antes de recuar.

Por volta das 9:12, os contratos de futuros de um mês operavam em alta de 13 por cento a 17.450 dólares, cerca de 1 mil dólares a mais que o preço do bitcoin no mercado “spot” - o preço pelo qual o bitcoin está sendo comprado e vendido atualmente.

O contrato de dois meses era negociado a 18.880 dólares e o contrato de três meses a 19.040 dólares.

“Os prêmios foram até agora muito altos, demonstrando que poucos querem ficar na ponta vendida”, disse Alistair Milne, gerente do Fundo de Moeda Digital Altana Digital, que tem 35 milhões de dólares em ativos sob gestão.

Em pouco mais de 12 horas após o lançamento, 2.780 contratos foram negociados, o que significa que cerca de 48,5 milhões de dólares foram teoricamente investidos. Isso se compara com os volumes diários de negociação de mais de 20 bilhões de dólares em todas as criptomoedas, de acordo com o site comercial Coinmarketcap.

“Levará tempo para que os volumes de derivativos subam, mas, eventualmente, se eles chegarem a uma porcentagem significativa do comércio global, eles deveriam em teoria ajudar a estabilizar as coisas”, disse Milne.

A maioria dos gestores de fundos das principais empresas de gestão de ativos e outros investidores institucionais dizem que não serão atraídos para o mercado pelo lançamento dos futuros.

Scientists said on Tuesday that genetic analysis of nine bone, tooth, skin, hair and fecal samples from museum and private collections attributed to the yeti, also called the Abominable Snowman, found that eight came from Asian black bears, Himalayan brown bears or Tibetan brown bears and one came from a dog.

“This strongly suggests that the yeti legend has a root in biological facts and that is has to do with bears that are living in the region today,” said biologist Charlotte Lindqvist of the University at Buffalo in New York and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, who led the study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Lindqvist called the study the most rigorous analysis to date of purported yeti specimens. The researchers sequenced mitochondrial DNA, genetic material in structures within cells that was passed down from mothers, of purported yeti samples from Tibet, India and Nepal as well as from black, brown and polar bear populations.

The yeti is a creature of folklore in the Himalayan region that has become a part of Western popular culture. It is separate from North America’s Sasquatch and Big Foot folklore.

“I initially became involved in this study when I was contacted about a previous study that found two purported yeti samples to match genetically with an ancient, 120,000-year-old polar bear that I was doing research on,” Lindqvist said.

“But the data was very limited, and it made me suspicious about the speculation that the yeti legend represented some strange, hybrid bear roaming the Himalaya mountains. So, I agreed to follow up on this study with a more rigorous approach based on more genetic data from more purported yeti samples,” Lindqvist added.

Lindqvist said purported yeti samples came from places including the Messner Mountain Museum in Italy and were gathered by British independent television production company Icon Films.

While no actual yeti was identified, the DNA research shed light on bear populations in the region.

The brown bears roaming the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and those in the western Himalayan mountains appear to belong to two separate bear populations separated from each other for thousands of years, despite their relative geographic proximity, Lindqvist said.","Abominable news: Purported yeti evidence came from bears, dog",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DT01X

A medida, que gerou protestos da indústria de petróleo, foi tomada como contrapartida para que deputados desistissem de defender uma barreira para a adoção do Repetro, um regime aduaneiro diferenciado para o setor de petróleo e gás, durante a aprovação de uma Medida Provisória sobre o tema no Congresso em novembro.

Fruto da negociação, o governo prometeu apoiar um Projeto de Lei que contemplará uma demanda do setor de fornecimento de bens e serviços, que seria a adoção de percentuais mais específicos de conteúdo local, que desse menos margem para a fuga do compromisso, além da elevação de percentuais, explicou o vice-presidente da Abimaq, Cesar Prata.

“Já está colocada a proposta, já tem um projeto de lei, deve ser votado nesta semana e ele será uma compensação para a ausência de barreiras tarifárias dentro do Repetro”, disse Prata à Reuters, explicando que abrir mão das barreiras para o Repetro não foi uma decisão fácil.

De autoria dos deputados Jerônimo Goergen (PP-RS), Leonardo Quintão (PMDB-MG) e outros, o projeto ainda não foi apresentado. Mas uma versão final do documento, obtida pela Reuters com uma fonte próxima ao tema, mostra alterações de percentuais e definições de setores.

Em um dos principais pontos, o PL determina que para a fase de desenvolvimento da produção os índices de apuração de conteúdo local sejam estabelecidos separadamente para bens e para serviços.

Dessa forma, para blocos em terra, o texto propõe para a etapa de desenvolvimento da produção conteúdo local mínimo de 50 por cento para bens e de 50 por cento para serviços, ante a regra anterior que determinava percentual de 50 por cento sem especificar setores.

No caso de contratos para a fase de exploração de blocos em mar, seja regime de concessão, seja de partilha, o PL propõe diferentes percentuais de conteúdo local para construção de poço (25 por cento para serviços e 40 por cento para bens); sistema de coleta e escoamento (40 por cento para serviços e para bens); e plataformas (25 por cento para serviços e de 40 por cento).

No caso da fase de exploração, os percentuais de conteúdo local na proposta permanecem os mesmos: 18 por cento para blocos em mar e 50 por cento para blocos em terra.

O presidente do Instituto Brasileiro de Petróleo (IBP), Jorge Camargo, que representa petroleiras no Brasil como Petrobras e Shell, afirmou há Reuters que “é uma ideia absolutamente imprópria colocar em lei política de conteúdo local”.

“Política, como o próprio nome diz, é política. O governo legitimamente eleito tem todo o direito de fazer política”, disse Camargo, destacando que os percentuais antes eram aprovados pelo governo e aplicados em contratos pela Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP).

“Não é o instrumento adequado fazer uma lei de conteúdo local, e muito menos uma lei que ainda vai criar uma insegurança jurídica, porque conteúdo local é definido em contrato entre a ANP e o concessionário”, completou.

CONTRATOS FUTUROS

O movimento obrigou a Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) a adiar a publicação de uma resolução que iria permitir a adoção de regras mais flexíveis de conteúdo local para contratos antigos, prevista atualmente para até 13 de dezembro. [nL1N1K91N8] [nL1N1G723B]

A resolução também vai disciplinar pedidos de isenção de conteúdo local (“waiver”, no jargão do setor) e as transferências de excedente de conteúdo local, todos os mecanismos aplicáveis aos contratos da 7ª à 13ª Rodadas de Concessão, da 1ª Rodada de Partilha da Produção e da Cessão Onerosa.

“A ANP se sentiu preocupada de (publicar da resolução) e ir contra ao projeto de lei que será votado agora”, disse Cesar Prata, da Abimaq.

O diretor-geral da ANP, Décio Oddone, afirmou nesta segunda-feira de manhã a jornalistas que pediu ao Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU) uma extensão do prazo, para que possa obter do governo uma aprovação para elevar e detalhar os percentuais de conteúdo local para plataformas de produção de petróleo.

Os demais percentuais já anunciados anteriormente, segundo o diretor-geral, não sofreram alterações.

Em sua nova proposta, a ANP busca que as plataformas de produção tenham 40 por cento de conteúdo local para engenharia, 40 por cento para máquinas e equipamentos e 40 por cento em construção, integração e montagem.

Nos valores já aprovados pelo governo anteriormente, as plataformas teriam apenas um total de 25 por cento de conteúdo local global, sem um detalhamento de onde seriam aplicados. Essa regra recebeu fortes críticas da indústria, uma vez que não detalhava para onde iria o conteúdo local, dando margem para que as petroleiras o cumprissem apenas com serviços.

“A gente quer criar uma condição para que a indústria destrave, para que (isso aconteça) precisa ter uma resolução que tenha maior probabilidade de ser cumprida efetivamente”, disse Oddone, que afirmou ter a expectativa de que o TCU conceda uma extensão de quatro meses para a publicação.

Oddone explicou que a nova resolução permitirá que as empresas optem por aderir aos novos percentuais de conteúdo local ou manter as condições originais dos seus contratos. Caso optem por aderir, as companhias não poderão pedir “waiver” sobre o mesmo contrato.

Oddone, no entanto, evitou comentar durante a coletiva de imprensa a decisão tomada em Brasília sobre o projeto de lei ou sobre a validade da medida para futuros leilões.",Brasil deve exigir mais de petroleiras em troca de concessões no Repetro,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1E523B-OBRBS

Apple did not give a price for the acquisition. Technology news website TechCrunch reported the deal on Friday with a price of as much as $400 million, far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately held Shazam.

In a statement, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Shazam “is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, across multiple platforms. ... We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today’s agreement.”

Apple did not elaborate on its plans, but the company will not be able to make any major changes to Shazam until it secures regulatory approval.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) was responding to comments on Saturday by Bangladesh Finance Minister Abul Maal A. Muhith who said he wanted to “wipe-out” the Manila-based bank.

The comments follow a Reuters story that Bangladesh Bank (BB) had asked the New York Federal Reserve of New York to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against RCBC seeking damages, according to several sources.

“RCBC has revealed everything it legally could to the (Philippine) Senate and its regulator, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. BB however, has concealed everything it could. The contrast is telling,” George dela Cuesta, head of legal affairs at RCBC, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Unidentified hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the New York Fed in February last year, using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.

Nearly two years later, there is no word on who was responsible and Bangladesh Bank has been able to retrieve only about $15 million, mostly from a Manila junket operator.

“BB is definitely partly to blame for the heist. Its refusal to be transparent is a continuing cover-up and a disservice to global efforts to combat cybercrime,” dela Cuesta said. “RCBC is clearly a victim of BB’s negligence.”

RCBC has blamed rogue employees and Philippine prosecutors have filed money laundering charges against a former RCBC bank manager and four people who owned the bank accounts where the funds were sent, but are not identifiable since the accounts were in fake names. They are the only people to be formally cited anywhere in the world in association with the crime.

RCBC was fined a record one billion pesos ($20 million) by the country’s central bank last year for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through it.

“BB must be sanctioned until it owns up and shares what it knows to prevent a repeat. Up to now, not one Bangladeshi has been identified in the inside job, much more hauled to the court,” dela Cuesta said.",Philippine bank accuses Bangladesh of heist 'cover-up',https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cyber-heist-bangladesh/philippine-bank-accuses-bangladesh-of-heist-cover-up-idUKKBN1E60A7?il=0

Eater New York reported that four women, who were not identified, accused Batali of touching them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that spanned at least two decades. Three worked for the chef during their careers, according to Eater New York.

Batali said in a statement emailed by his representative Risa Heller, “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted.”

“That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses,” he said. “I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused.”

Reuters could not independently confirm the accusations.

Batali said in the statement that he was stepping away from day-to-day operations of his businesses as he works to regain people’s trust and respect.

Batali’s reputation as a master of seasonal Italian food turned him into a restaurant executive, television star, cookbook author and one of the world’s most recognizable chefs. He premiered on Food Network in 1997 on the show “Molto Mario” and in 2011 helped launch “The Chew” on ABC.

B&B Hospitality Group, which services about 24 restaurants owned by Batali and other chefs, said in an emailed statement that it takes such accusations seriously.

“We have had systematic policies and training about sexual harassment for over 10 years, including a detailed procedure for employees to report complaints to senior management,” B&B Hospitality Group said. “All members of management have participated in these trainings, including Mr. Batali.”

“Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and he has already done so,” the company said in the statement.

The ABC Television Network, a unit of Walt Disney Co, said in a statement, “We have asked Mario Batali to step away from The Chew while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention.”

”ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”

Now, the conversation should turn against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s gutting of campus sexual assault procedures.

DeVos has rejected Obama-era guidelines on how colleges investigate sexual assault, saying that the rights of the accused were being violated and that schools will be permitted to use whatever standard of proof they deem fair while the Department of Education (DOE) sorts out new guidelines.

To make matters more confusing, a footnote in DOE’s recommendations added that the standard of evidence for sexual allegations should be consistent with whatever standard the school uses in other student misconduct cases. Left unexplained, because it makes no sense, is why sexual assault should be treated the same as, say, plagiarism − which comes with written evidence and no traumatized young victim. (The DOE did not respond to a request for comment on the guidelines.)

John Lloyd: Britain's mess extends beyond Brexit

Sexual assault on college campuses is a long-standing scourge: nearly one in five women will be sexually assaulted while in college. It’s also a complex crime to combat, happening, as it does, under special circumstances: In an environment where both alleged victim and alleged perpetrator may both be living and studying on a self-contained campus where conflicts and even criminal behavior is often mediated by the school rather than law enforcement.

The way colleges and universities handle sexual assault complaints has long been inadequate, with female victims of assault often disadvantaged by an institution that has an incentive to sweep assault under the rug. (The parents of a prospective applicant surely don’t want to hear that a school has a rape problem.) As a result, many assault victims, forced to go through meaningless mediation processes or stay in classes and dorms with their assailants, dropped out (or failed out because of post-traumatic stress disorder), curtailing their college careers and hampering their own futures, while their assailants were able to graduate and continue on as if nothing happened.

In 2011 the Obama administration’s DOE issued guidelines to put the accused and the accuser on more equal footing. The guidelines, outlined in a “Dear Colleague” letter, encouraged schools adjudicating sexual assault to use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard in determining fault – that is, is it more likely than not that the accused committed the act in question?

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos gives a policy address on rape and sexual assault on college and university campuses, at George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., September 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Theiler

This is a lower burden of proof than in criminal cases, where the stakes – jail time and the attendant curtailing of one’s liberties – are much higher. It’s also a lower burden of proof than the “clear and convincing evidence” standard, which is used in some civil cases.

But “preponderance of the evidence” is the standard used in civil cases involving sex and race discrimination. The reason colleges are adjudicating sexual assault cases in the first place is because of Title IX, a federal anti-discrimination statute dictating that women should have equal access to education. Sexual assault impedes equal access, making it a Title IX discrimination issue, so the standard of evidence often used in civil discrimination cases is appropriate.

This has not gone over well with men’s rights activists, many conservatives, and some advocates for the rights of the accused. For some, the evidentiary standard itself is too low; opinions of what should be used instead vary from none at all (the argument being that colleges should avoid this entirely and require any reports of assault to go to the police) to a “clear and convincing” standard, which is a higher bar than preponderance of the evidence. Others, including me, believe the evidentiary standard is not the problem but are troubled that the adjudication processes vary wildly from school to school, and are often opaque, incomprehensible, and done without clear rules of evidence and the right of each party to have an advocate. In any case, for many conservatives, the whole system is unfairly skewed. For many feminists, the Obama rules were a step in the right direction, but are being implemented poorly.

Enter DeVos, who early in her tenure invited men’s rights groups to meet with her to discuss the issue. These are such vicious misogynists that one of their leaders said about NFL player Ray Rice’s then-fiancé, whom he attacked on camera in an elevator and knocked unconscious, “if she hadn’t aggravated him, she wouldn’t have been hit.” Candice E. Jackson, one of DeVos’s top deputies, told The New York Times that sexual assault “accusations — 90 percent of them — fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because [the victim] just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.’” Let’s also not forget that DeVos serves in an administration headed by Donald Trump, who has boasted of grabbing women’s genitals.

So it was no surprise that DeVos is overturning the Obama-era directives. This is the worst possible approach. Even though there was roiling debate over which standard to use, everyone agreed that lack of clarity on rules was an ongoing issue. The DeVos directive muddied the waters even further.

But in the wake of Weinstein, we see why this matters – and why simply turning this matter over to law enforcement is not a viable option. Many of the women who say Weinstein harassed or assaulted them would not be able to prove it in a court of law, given that physical evidence was limited or non-existent, and the case would come down to her version of events versus his. Even when police did have evidence in the form of audio recordings wherein Weinstein admitted to criminal misdeeds, the district attorney chose not to prosecute. For women in Hollywood, making a powerful enemy while being powerless to fight back meant stalled careers and emotional distress. For women on college campuses, having an assault go ignored can mean everything they have worked for up until that point in their lives is lost: Their degree, their social and prospective professional network and their sense of safety in their own homes and communities.

Research on sexual assailants is disturbingly limited, but we do know that many campus attackers are, like Weinstein, serial offenders. And we know that, like Weinstein, they target the most vulnerable – women who are new on campus and don’t have a strong social network, and women of lower socioeconomic classes who are considered more disposable than the women who are considered a frat boy’s social and economic peers.

On campuses across the United States, women make the same calculation as Weinstein’s accusers did when they kept silent for years. What will I have to go through to prove what happened to me? What do I stand to lose – my reputation, my friends, my dignity, my future?

When women don’t see a fair path to justice, they don’t report assaults. Most rapes still go unreported, on campus and off of it, often because women are ashamed and afraid of being disbelieved. DeVos is making this already-tough road even steeper. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the Weinstein case, it’s that the last thing victims need are more barriers blocking their way.",Commentary: The next front in the fight against sexual assault,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-filipovic-rape-commentary/commentary-the-next-front-in-the-fight-against-sexual-assault-idUSKBN1DE2WD

To advocates who believe that sending weapons to the Ukrainian government will bloody Russia’s nose and send President Vladimir Putin a message, this pending decision couldn’t have come soon enough. Arming Kiev is a popular prescription supported by top military officers and many lawmakers in both parties.

Popular, however, doesn’t mean smart. Opening up America’s stockpile to Ukraine is not in Washington’s national security interest. In fact, it is bound to make a conflict that is mostly frozen into a more deadly one and it complicates any reasonable chance of a diplomatic resolution.

While it may be uncomfortable to admit, the political orientation of Ukraine and how Ukrainians choose to manage (or mismanage) their economy and political system doesn’t directly affect the United States. As Rajan Menon and William Ruger wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine last month, “Ukraine matters more to Russia than it does to the United States.”

To Washington, Ukraine is a post-Soviet state whose oligarchic politics and systemic corruption have severely handicapped the country’s economic outlook. U.S. security interests in Europe are not wedded to whether Kiev succeeds in establishing a more democratic and accountable form of government. At best, Ukraine is a peripheral country that the United States doesn’t have a treaty obligation to defend if its territory is invaded.

To Putin, however, Ukraine is an integral puzzle in his grand strategy of making Russia as relevant a global player as it was during the Cold War. A wholesale Westernization of Ukrainian politics, from associations with the European Union (EU) to a possible membership in NATO, would destroy that ambition and ruin a significant portion of Putin’s political legacy. Indeed, the possibility of Ukraine increasing its trade relationship and political direction with the United States and Europe was enough of a national security threat to Putin that he was willing to deploy Russian soldiers, paratroopers, and special forces on Ukrainian territory to carve out a zone of influence there. Putin’s belief that a Russian-friendly Ukraine is a national security imperative for Moscow won’t be changed by a couple dozen anti-tank missiles from the United States.

The second concern for the Trump administration is how Putin might respond to any escalation. As former National Security Council official Charles Kupchan argued in the Washington Post: “The notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin would give up his hold on Donbass [Eastern Ukraine] if a few more Russians come home in body bags is to dramatically misread the Kremlin.” Yet this false assumption is what undergirds the arguments from proponents of lethal assistance to the Ukrainians.

It’s impossible to understand why some U.S. legislators are so confident that Moscow will react in the way they expect. The three-and-a-half year long war has shown that Russia is ruthless in escalating its involvement and investment in the conflict to prevent a military victory for Kiev. In fact, to expect that Moscow would respond to more Russian casualties by suing for a peace settlement is to ignore completely how Putin has behaved since Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.

When separatist units in Donetsk and Luhansk were losing ground to pro-Kiev forces early in the war, Russia came to their rescue. In the summer of 2014, when pro-Ukrainian troops were retaking towns that Kiev previously lost, columns of Russian tanks, artillery, heavy weapons, and soldiers crossed the border into Ukraine to ensure that there were no more Ukrainian territorial advances in strategic areas. When the stalemated battle in the city of Ilovaisk was slowly moving Kiev’s way, conventional Russian soldiers and weapons were fast-tracked to the frontline in what would turn out to be one of the deadliest days for Ukrainian troops in the war.

Months later, when the separatists were in jeopardy of retreating from the strategic town of Delbatseve, Russian tanks were deployed and quickly forced an undermanned, disorganized, demoralized, and tired contingent of Kiev forces to withdraw. There’s no reason to think that Putin would respond less violently now if Washington sent defense shipments to Ukraine.

The most negative impact of additional U.S. involvement is that it will likely spoil Moscow’s willingness to cooperate on a Ukrainian peacekeeping proposal. While Moscow has insisted that the 2014 and 2015 Minsk protocols are the only way the war in Ukraine can end peacefully, Putin has openly acknowledged that there may need to be greater international involvement if that peace is to be sustainable. He broached the subject of deploying U.N. troops along the contact line this September and even agreed to explore greater access to peacekeepers in separatist-controlled territory after a call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The concept is now being discussed within the Trump administration and between the U.S. and Russian special envoys to the conflict, suggesting sincerity on the Russian side.

A White House authorization to send equipment to Kiev could stop that dialogue. It’s difficult to understand why the United States would escalate the war when there may finally be an opening to explore a U.N.-enforced cessation of hostilities that could lead to a political settlement to the conflict.

The Russians could respond to increased U.S. involvement in Ukraine in other ways too. Moscow could, for example, use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block U.S.-led efforts to stop North Korea’s nuclear program. Putin could expand military and intelligence cooperation with Iran to undermine the Trump administration’s policy of containing Iranian expansionism.

The costs to the U.S. of turning Ukraine into a proxy war against Russia overshadow the benefit of increasing Moscow’s casualty count. Sending arms to Kiev will do very little to help resolve the conflict. Sometimes the best course of action for the White House is not to get more involved on issues peripheral to American grand strategy.",Commentary: Why the U.S. shouldn’t send arms to Ukraine,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-depetris-ukraine-commentary/commentary-why-the-u-s-shouldnt-send-arms-to-ukraine-idUSKBN1DS1XZ

O caso refere-se à primeira denúncia que o então procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, ofereceu no final de junho contra Temer e Rocha Loures ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) em que o ex-assessor recebeu uma mala com 500 mil reais de Ricardo Saud, da J&F, ofertado por Joesley Batista.

Essa verba, segundo a denúncia, seria parte dos 38 milhões de reais que o grupo empresarial iria pagar a Temer e representantes para assegurar apoio do governo a iniciativas da J&F. A Câmara dos Deputados, entretanto, suspendeu em agosto a parte contra o presidente, mas o STF decidiu fatiar o caso e mandar a parte de Rocha Loures para a primeira instância.

Na decisão, o juiz federal Jaime Travassos Sarinho, da 10ª Vara do Distrito Federal, disse que a “possibilidade jurídica do pedido é indiscutível, tendo em vista que os fatos narrados na denúncia, em tese, constituem crime”.

“Igualmente, verifico que há substrato probatório mínimo que sustenta a inicial acusatória, existindo, portanto, justa causa para a deflagração da ação penal. A inicial acusatória traz narrativa coerente de eventos sequenciais que teriam resultado no recebimento pelo acusado, pessoalmente, de vantagem indevida no valor de 500.000 reais, ofertada por Joesley Mendonça Batista, proprietário do Grupo J&F, cuja entrega foi realizada por Ricardo Saud, executivo do mesmo grupo empresarial”, citou o magistrado.

O juiz afirmou ainda que o pedido de suspensão do caso feito por Rocha Loures não paralisa o curso do caso porque ele advém de uma decisão do STF. Ele disse que o recurso pendente do Supremo --que pediu para um colegiado da corte avaliar se a denúncia contra o ex-assessor também tem de ficar paralisada por ter conexão com Temer-- não tem efeito suspensivo. Nesta quarta-feira, o Supremo deve analisar esse e outros recursos que querem suspender o andamento de investigações na primeira instância contra denunciados juntamente com o presidente.

Rocha Loures terá 10 dias para apresentar resposta escrita à acusação, por meio de advogado. Ele poderá, entre outras providências, pedir a apresentação de provas e convocação de testemunhas em sua defesa.

Em nota, a defesa do ex-assessor disse não ter tido acesso à decisão, mas enfatiza que, se for mantido o processo contra Rocha Loures na Justiça de primeira instância, ”estará sendo descumprida a decisão da Câmara e também desrespeitada a Constituição, porque indiretamente estará sendo julgado o presidente, uma vez que os fatos e as provas são as mesmas.

Over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics.

Three of his accusers, Jessica Leeds, Rachel Crooks, and Samantha Holvey said at a news conference on Monday that the accusations warranted new consideration given the broader discussion of sexual harassment in U.S. society.

Brave New Films, a nonprofit filmmaker, produced a video featuring 16 of Trump’s accusers and organized the news conference in New York on Monday. In the film, women accused Trump of kissing them without permission, grabbing their private parts, putting his hand up their skirts, or making other unwanted advances.

Congress should “put aside their party affiliations and investigate Mr. Trump’s history of sexual misconduct,” said Crooks, a former receptionist for a real estate firm, who was flanked by Leeds and Holvey.

The women said they do not think Trump will resign over the allegations but that he should be held accountable.

Trump and White House officials have denied the allegations, some of which date back to the 1980s.

“These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement on Monday, questioning the women’s timing and political motives.

Trump, a Republican, faces legal action in one related case.

Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN that Trump should resign over the accusations.

“These allegations are credible,“ Gillibrand said in an interview on Monday with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. ”They are numerous. I’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.”

Gillibrand recently said former President Bill Clinton, a fellow Democrat, should have stepped down during the 1990s scandal that led the House of Representatives to vote to impeach him. On Monday, she said that if Trump does not immediately resign, Congress “should have appropriate investigations of his behavior and hold him accountable.”

A number of powerful and high-profile men have been accused in recent months of sexual misconduct, including three members of Congress, Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein and former NBC news anchor Matt Lauer.

Reuters has not independently verified the accusations against Trump, Weinstein, Lauer or the three congressmen.

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and one of the most high-profile women in Trump’s administration, said on Sunday that any woman who has felt mistreated by a man has the right to speak up, even if she is accusing the president.

Democrat Chris Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary panel, said it was unlikely that the Republican-controlled Congress would act on the accusations, which were known before the November 2016 presidential election.

“My hunch is it gets reviewed at the next election,” Coons told CNN.

Sexual harassment accusations have also been made against Republican candidate Roy Moore who is running in a U.S. Senate race this week in Alabama. Trump has backed Moore, a former judge, even as congressional Republicans denounced the candidate and called on him to pull out of the race.

The accusations against Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign when a videotape surfaced of a 2005 conversation caught on an open microphone in which Trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women.

A combination of high inflation, caused in large part by the 2016 Brexit vote, and weak wage growth means British workers are expected to see their salaries fall in real terms by 0.5 percent next year, according to a survey published by the firm.

The most recent official data has shown British average weekly earnings fell by an annual 0.4 percent in the three months to September when adjusted for inflation.

Globally, inflation-adjusted wages are expected to rise by 1.5 percent next year, Korn Ferry said, the weakest predicted increase in five years, underscoring the challenge for policymakers in many countries where unemployment is low but wage growth is weak.

Benjamin Frost, Korn Ferry’s global general manager, said the situation in Britain was aggravated by the jump in inflation which hit 3 percent in October and is expected to stay at that level when data for November is released on Tuesday.

“What stands out is that employers are not increasing their pay rises to account for that,” he said. “They have limited ability to charge their customers more and improvements in productivity are easier said than done in the short term.”

In the United States, workers were expected to see a real-terms salary increase of 1 percent in 2018, based on forecasts of wage increases of 3 percent and inflation of 2 percent.

Netanyahu, durante visita a Bruxelas para uma reunião de ministros de Relações Exteriores da UE, disse que a decisão de Trump tornou a paz no Oriente Médio possível “porque o reconhecimento da realidade é a substância da paz, a fundação da paz”.

It’s an awesome display of U.S. military power and reach, a reminder of Washington’s unparalleled ability to project global force. At the same time, however, it’s also a sign of how stretched those forces have become.

Getting three carriers to the Pacific has been an intrinsic part of Washington’s strategy to intimidate North Korea. But to do so required pulling forces from a host of other potential conflict areas, including the Gulf.

The ever-increasing demand for military resources in a growing number of places is causing increased concern in the U.S. military. In June, a report by the U.S. Army War College described America’s military clout as “fraying” and bluntly concluded that the era of U.S. global military primacy that followed the fall of the Berlin wall was over. America’s armed forces have a variety of strategies to tackle that decline but the truth is that coming wars will look very different from the sort of military deployments taken for granted in the recent past.

The change from a decade or so ago could scarcely be starker. In the aftermath of 9/11, America’s conventional military capability was narrowly focused on a handful of locations, primarily Iraq and Afghanistan. The resources plowed into them were stupendous – $5.6 trillion so far, academics at Brown University estimated this month. That would imply a cost per individual U.S. taxpayer of more than $23,000, including future care for veterans.

At their height, those wars dominated U.S. military thinking, planning and workload in a way that is hard to overstate. Working from Pentagon figures, the Brown researchers estimate that some 2.7 million American service personnel passed through those two countries in that time, more than half of them deploying more than once. Officially, however, these conflicts were never seen as endless wars – the hope was always that one last surge of troops would win the day and allow a larger withdrawal.

That didn’t happen, and U.S. military planners now assume there will be a substantial presence in Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries for years, if not decades, to come. Since the middle of the Obama administration, however, the Pentagon has quietly and comprehensively changed its approach to those wars, aiming for a much more sustainable “advise and assist” model working through local forces.

Speaking at the Association of the U.S. Army meeting in Washington in October, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley made it clear he expected such missions to grow substantially in the years to come. The success of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria demonstrates such tactics can work. But there have also been substantial failures and wastage, not least in Afghanistan where local security forces continue to struggle despite absorbing $70 billion of U.S. funding since 2001.

Much of the burden of U.S. operations in the last 15 years has fallen on a handful of special operations units, whose budgets, personnel numbers and deployments have all risen dramatically. They are now dangerously overstretched, and the U.S. Army is now looking to create more mainstream units to take on unconventional deployments.

With much of the fighting left to local forces, U.S. casualties are substantially lower. But as the death of four U.S. Green Berets in Niger last month demonstrated, putting troops far forward with less backup than they could call on in Iraq and Afghanistan means that when things go wrong, they go bad fast.

Another awkward truth: In the last year U.S. personnel have been more likely to die in accidents than action, the result of a series of incidents including the high profile collisions of destroyers USS Fitzgerald and McCain. That toll suggests that even the parts of the U.S. military that have not been fighting wars are perhaps dangerously overstretched.

That’s been particularly true in Asia, where both the Fitzgerald and McCain were based. Tensions with China and North Korea have kept those units on high alert. In Europe too, heightened tensions with Russia have resulted in a scale of U.S. military activity unseen since the Cold War. U.S. troops, planes, ships and submarines are now on almost continuous exercises to reassure allies and track Russia’s increasingly active forces as Moscow probes NATO air and sea borders.

The Pentagon budget – $825 billion this fiscal year – is rising, and continues to dwarf that of any other nation. But it is also spread much more widely. China and Russia – spending $146 billion and 70 billion respectively – lack America’s global reach, but are more aggressively focused on their own immediate neighborhoods. Both have aggressively plowed resources into techniques and tactics such as cyber warfare and missiles that U.S. tacticians worry might give them the edge in any local war.

Some of that was expected – the Obama administration began its “pivot” to Asia in 2012 because of the perceived growing China threat. Much, however, was not – not least the speed with which North Korea has raced towards being able to strike the U.S. with nuclear-tipped missiles.

Washington’s military capabilities still dwarf anyone else’s. But it now faces a very real danger that its foes may be able to bleed it to death without ever confronting it in battle.",Commentary: The truth behind the U.S. show of force in Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-military-commentary/commentary-the-truth-behind-the-u-s-show-of-force-in-asia-idUSKBN1DD20A

China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.

Numerous Chinese fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft conducted “routine” and “planned” distant sea patrols on Monday to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke said on the military branch’s microblog.

H-6K bombers, Su-30 and J-11 fighter jets, and surveillance, alert and refueling aircraft flew over the Miyako Strait in Japan’s south and the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines to “test real combat capabilities”, Shen said.

Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan said in a statement they had dispatched aircraft and ships to monitor the activity of the Chinese military and that the drills were not unusual and people should not be alarmed.

China has conducted numerous similar patrols near Taiwan this year, saying such practices have been normalized as it presses ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores.

Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. Taiwan is well armed, mostly with U.S. weaponry, but has been pressing Washington to sell it more high-tech equipment to better deter China.

In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.

That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would invade Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited Taiwan.

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.29 a barrel at 0253 GMT, up 60 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last close.

That marks the first time Brent has risen above $65 since June, 2015.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $58.30 a barrel, up 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement.

“Brent crude raced higher ... as news broke that the North Sea’s Forties Pipeline system would have to be shut down for a ‘number of weeks’ after a hairline crack was found in it,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “The pipeline ... is a significant component underpinning the Brent benchmark.”

Britain’s Forties oil pipeline, the country’s largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were revealed.

“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.

GOING WIDE

The jump in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices to almost $7 a barrel, up from around $5 last week, making U.S. oil exports more attractive. CL-LCO1=R

The cheaper WTI is also a result of rising U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.71 million bpd, levels not seen since the early 1970s.

U.S. production is now also not far off that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The rising U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, to support prices by withholding supplies.

The massive response exposed the limits of the antiterrorism force the city has built since the deadly attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It has learned to respond quickly and effectively to attacks but faces an almost impossible task in trying to thwart every threat, particularly the acts of “lone wolves” targeting public places and New York’s vast transit system.

Nearly 6 million people ride New York’s subway each day, entering at any one of the system’s 472 stations - more stops than any other in the world.

That open access is partly what allows U.S. train systems to carry five times as many passengers as airlines but also leaves unique security vulnerabilities, according to a Congressional Research Service report earlier this year.

“You can’t search everyone entering a subway system, particularly a system the size of the one in New York,” said Tom Nolan, a former U.S. Department of Homeland Security analyst who is now a professor of criminology at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.

No one was killed in Monday’s attack, and the person most severely injured was the accused bomber, whom police identified as Akayed Ullah, 27.

New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo sounded relieved when he told reporters that just three other people had been slightly hurt in the attack.

“When you hear about a bomb in the subway station, which is in many ways one of our worst nightmares, the reality turns out better than the initial expectation and fear,” Cuomo said.

He had reason to expect worse: Suicide bombers killed 52 people in on London subways and a bus system in 2005, 40 people were killed in the 2010 bombing of the Moscow subway and last year 32 died in coordinated attacks on Brussels’ subway and airport.

“This is a fact of life, whether you’re in New York or London or Paris,” New York Police Department counterterrorism chief John Miller told reporters. “It can happen anywhere.”

DOGS, CAMERAS AND WEAPONS

A network of cameras blankets almost all of New York’s subway system, which sprawls over 665 miles (1,070 km) of tracks. The New York City Police Department uses radiation detectors to search for “dirty” bombs, which combine a traditional explosive with radioactive material, said Anthony Roman, a private security consultant who is familiar with NYPD antiterrorism efforts.

Undercover and uniformed police patrol the system, along with bomb-sniffing dogs, random screening posts and heavily armed tactical officers.

The city’s Joint Terrorism Task Force collects intelligence from overseas, and cameras equipped with facial and license plate recognition can help investigators track suspects in real time, Roman said.

But attempting to screen every passenger, as airports do using metal detectors and body scanners, is an impossible task and would only create more opportunities for attacks by causing crowding.

“They will never be 100 percent,” Roman said. “The goal is to prevent and deter the vast majority of events, and for those few that occur, minimize their effect by quick, coordinated, interdepartmental response.”

The NYPD’s Miller said intelligence had stopped at least 26 plots since 2001. But the proliferation of so-called “lone wolf” attackers, who are self-radicalized and not working with an overseas militant group, has made it harder to do so, experts said.

Both Ullah and Sayfullo Saipov, accused of killing eight people on a Manhattan bike lane with a rented truck in the name of Islamic State, appear to have acted alone, according to authorities.

“When you have lone attackers, it’s much more difficult,” said Max Leitschuh, the senior transportation analyst at the risk management and security consulting company iJET International.

Following Monday’s attack, cities including Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles increased security for their mass transit systems.

Ultimately, those efforts are mostly about reassuring the public, said Maria Haberfeld, an expert in police counterterrorism and a professor at New York’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

“You have to accept it,” said Haberfeld, who served in a counterterrorist unit in the Israel Defense Forces. “You can only put so many barriers out there before you abandon the idea of an open society.”",New York subway attack shows limits of counterterror strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-incident-security/new-york-subway-attack-shows-limits-of-counterterror-strategy-idUSKBN1E52T9

Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under Italian pressure. More than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years.

The agreement to set up the operations room was announced after a meeting in Tripoli between the head of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Seraj, Libyan Interior Minister Aref Khodja, and his Italian counterpart Marco Minniti.

A statement from Seraj’s office said the center would consist of “representatives from the coastguard, the illegal migration department, the Libyan attorney general and the intelligence services, along with their Italian counterparts.”

No details were given on the location of the center and how it would operate. In the past, migrant smugglers have worked with impunity in western Libya, where the GNA has little authority over armed groups that have real power on the ground.

The Italian navy already has a presence in Tripoli port, providing “technical” assistance to Libya’s coastguard, according to Italian and Libyan officials.

The coastguard, which is receiving funding and training from the European Union, has become more assertive in recent months in intercepting migrants and bringing them back to Libya.

Activists have criticized the policy, since migrants often face extreme hardship and abuse in Libya, including forced labor. Migrants who are caught trying to cross to Italy are put in severely overcrowded detention centers authorized by the interior ministry.

The GNA has said it is investigating reports of migrants being auctioned as slaves in Libya, after CNN broadcast footage appearing to show such auctions.

According to Saturday’s statement, Seraj told Minniti that “despite the successes achieved in the migration file, the number of illegal immigrants outside shelters remains large and we need more cooperation, especially in securing the borders of southern Libya through which these migrants flow”.",Libya and Italy to set up operations room to tackle migrant smuggling,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1E405S-OZATP

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) was responding to comments on Saturday by Bangladesh Finance Minister Abul Maal A. Muhith who said he wanted to “wipe-out” the Manila-based bank.

The comments follow a Reuters story that Bangladesh Bank (BB) had asked the New York Federal Reserve of New York to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against RCBC seeking damages, according to several sources.

“RCBC has revealed everything it legally could to the (Philippine) Senate and its regulator, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. BB however, has concealed everything it could. The contrast is telling,” George dela Cuesta, head of legal affairs at RCBC, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Unidentified hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the New York Fed in February last year, using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.

Nearly two years later, there is no word on who was responsible and Bangladesh Bank has been able to retrieve only about $15 million, mostly from a Manila junket operator.

“BB is definitely partly to blame for the heist. Its refusal to be transparent is a continuing cover-up and a disservice to global efforts to combat cybercrime,” dela Cuesta said. “RCBC is clearly a victim of BB’s negligence.”

RCBC has blamed rogue employees and Philippine prosecutors have filed money laundering charges against a former RCBC bank manager and four people who owned the bank accounts where the funds were sent, but are not identifiable since the accounts were in fake names. They are the only people to be formally cited anywhere in the world in association with the crime.

RCBC was fined a record one billion pesos ($20 million) by the country’s central bank last year for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through it.

“BB must be sanctioned until it owns up and shares what it knows to prevent a repeat. Up to now, not one Bangladeshi has been identified in the inside job, much more hauled to the court,” dela Cuesta said.",Philippine bank accuses Bangladesh of heist 'cover-up',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-bangladesh/philippine-bank-accuses-bangladesh-of-heist-cover-up-idUKKBN1E60A5?il=0

The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on “energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.”

Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F) this century, surpassing a “tipping point” that a global climate deal aims to avert.

Exxon’s statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company’s board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon’s long-term outlook.

Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state’s comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday’s decision “a win for shareholders and for the company’s ability to manage risk.”

However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company’s statement. “This is giving no detail,” said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring’s resolution. He said Exxon’s statement “needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they’re responsive to last year’s request.”

An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing.

Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon’s May annual meeting.

Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks.

Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts.

BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon.

The report will carry weight beyond the company’s next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.

The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees’ Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday.

Malinowski’s agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with “climate-competent” perspectives.",Exxon to provide details on climate-change impact to its business,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-climate/exxon-to-provide-details-on-climate-change-impact-to-its-business-idUSKBN1E602L?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Greta Gerwig, who made her solo directorial debut with the warmly reviewed coming-of-age tale “Lady Bird,” was snubbed in a category in which Scott, Guillermo del Toro, Martin McDonagh, Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg were nominated.

Patty Jenkins, who delivered box office superhero smash “Wonder Woman,” was also left out, along with directors Dee Rees, of Netflix Inc’s racial period drama “Mudbound,” and Kathryn Bigelow, of the racially charged drama “Detroit.”

“It’s a terrible shame, to be honest,” said McDonagh, who wrote and directed small-town drama “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” “I know there have been great screenplays by women recognized this year but not directing, and maybe that will change in the Oscars.”

Gerwig, 34, was nominated for best screenplay for writing “Lady Bird,” which also landed two acting nods for its star, Saoirse Ronan, and supporting actress, Laurie Metcalf.

Metcalf told Reuters that Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” set was collaborative and stress-free.

“I‘m spoiled rotten,” Metcalf said. “She just made it a beautiful and personal experience for the entire cast and crew.”

Other surprises included Vietnamese-American actress Hong Chau for her breakout role in the best supporting actress race for futuristic comedy “Downsizing.”

Other key snubs included Amazon’s interracial romantic comedy “The Big Sick,” which failed to land any nominations, especially for its star Kumail Nanjiani, who wrote the film with his real-life wife on the circumstances that brought them together.","Female directors snubbed, Plummer surprises at Golden Globe nominations",https://in.reuters.com/article/awards-goldenglobes-surprises/female-directors-snubbed-plummer-surprises-at-golden-globe-nominations-idINKBN1E528B

FILE PHOTO: A magnifying glass is held in front of a computer screen in this picture illustration taken in Berlin May 21, 2013. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski

Group-IB warned that the attacks, which began 18 months ago and allow money to be stolen from banks’ automated teller machines (ATMs), appear to be ongoing and that banks in Latin America could be targeted next.

The first attack occurred in the spring of 2016 against banks in First Data’s (FDC.N) “STAR” network, the largest U.S. bank messaging system connecting ATMs at more than 5,000 organizations, Group-IB researchers said in a 36-page report.

In a statement, First Data said that a number of small financial institutions operating on the STAR network had had their credentials breached for administering debit cards earlier in 2016, leading First Data to implement new mandatory security controls. It said the STAR network was never itself breached.

The firm said it was continuing to investigate a number of incidents where hackers studied how to make money transfers through the SWIFT banking system, while stopping short of saying whether any such attacks had been carried out successfully.

SWIFT said in October that hackers were still targeting its interbank messaging system, but security controls instituted after last year’s $81 million heist at Bangladesh’s central bank had thwarted many of those attempts. (reut.rs/2z1b7Bo)

Group-IB has dubbed the hacker group “MoneyTaker” after the name of software it used to hijack payment orders to then cash out funds through a network of low-level “money mules” who were hired to pick up money from automated teller machines.

The security researchers said they had identified 18 banks who were hit including 15 across 10 states in the United States, two in Russia and one in Britain. Beside banks, financial software firms and one law firm were targeted.

The average amount of money stolen in each of 14 U.S. ATM heists was $500,000 per incident. Losses in Russia averaged $1.2 million per incident, but one bank there managed to catch the attack and return some of the stolen funds, Group-IB said.

Hackers also stole documentation for OceanSystems’ Fed Link transfer system used by 200 banks in Latin America and the United States, it said. In addition, they successfully attacked the Russian interbank messaging system known as AW CRB.

Once hackers penetrated targeted banks and financial organizations, they stole internal bank documentation in order to mount future ATM attacks, Group-IB said. In Russia, the hackers continued to spy on bank networks after break-ins, while at least one U.S. bank had documents robbed twice, it said.

Group-IB said it had notified Interpol and Europol in order to assist in law enforcement investigations.

The unidentified hackers used a mix of constantly changing tools and tactics to bypass anti-virus and other traditional security software while being careful to eliminate traces of their operations, helping them to go largely unnoticed. To disguise their moves, hackers used security certificates from brands such as Bank of America, the Fed, Microsoft and Yahoo.","Hackers hit U.S., Russian banks in ATM robbery scam: report",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-banks-atm/hackers-hit-u-s-russian-banks-in-atm-robbery-scam-report-idUSKBN1E51SZ

Indicado para a Secretaria de Governo, Marun disse ainda contar com um quórum “robusto” de aproximadamente 480 parlamentares para um início seguro da votação da proposta, que já deve começar a ser discutida na quinta-feira desta semana.

“Eu calculo aí em torno de 40 a 50 votos que nós devemos ainda buscar para chegar ao plenário com segurança”, disse Marun a jornalistas nesta manhã. “Temos um crescimento constante (de votos), mas ainda não se criou aquela onda.”

Por se tratar de uma Proposta de Emenda à Constituição (PEC), a reforma precisa do voto favorável de ao menos 308 dos 513 deputados, em dois turnos de votação. Daí a necessidade do governo de garantir não só um quórum elevado em plenário, mas uma margem de segurança de votos favoráveis acima do mínimo exigido.

Marun descartou a possibilidade de a votação da reforma ser acelerada para que ocorra ainda nesta semana. A reforma deve ter sua discussão iniciada na quinta-feira, para ser votada na próxima semana.

“Eu não vejo essa possibilidade (de votar nesta semana), até porque nós entendemos que não é producente”, afirmou. “O cronograma estabelecido pelo presidente (Rodrigo Maia), eu penso que ele é positivo.”

Marun admitiu que no caso de não conseguir angariar parlamentares suficientes na próxima semana o governo sofrerá uma derrota, mas em uma “batalha”, não na “guerra”.

O deputado defendeu que o fracasso em votar a proposta pode levar a economia a uma situação pior do que estava antes da retomada do crescimento. “A recaída é pior do que a doença”, disse.

“Vamos tentar votar agora, vamos conseguir.... mas, digamos que venha essa derrota. Se vier, (a reforma) fica na pauta. Vamos chegar aqui em fevereiro e esse vai ser o assunto. Vamos disputar a eleição e esse vai ser o assunto.”

Em uma demonstração de quem tem o discurso afinado com o do governo, Marun disse que a proposta não sairá da pauta enquanto não for votada.

“Isso não sai mais da pauta. Nós na quinta-feira colocamos em discussão a reforma da Previdência e ela não sai mais da pauta”, afirmou.

A reforma da Previdência tem sido o grande foco do governo neste fim de ano, após o esforço para derrubar no plenário da Câmara dos Deputados duas denúncias contra o presidente Michel Temer, uma delas envolvendo dois de seus ministros.

Governistas vêm trabalhando para obter os votos necessários, mas ainda enfrentam resistência, mesmo entre aliados. Alguns deles relatam que a questão já não se refere mais ao texto da reforma --em versão bastante flexibilizada e bem mais enxuta para facilitar sua aprovação--, mas ao momento.

Parlamentares temem que um posicionamento favorável à PEC possa repercutir nas eleições de outubro de 2018. Também apontavam insatisfação com a articulação do governo, agora prestes a ser assumida por Marun, com apoio da base.","Governo se concentra agora para convencer de 40 a 50 deputados para votar Previdência, diz Marun",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1E51Z9-OBRTP

“Die Welt wartet darauf, dass wir agieren können”, sagte Kanzlerin und CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel am Montag in Berlin. “Deshalb bin ich für zügige Gespräche.” CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt forderte, bei den geplanten Sondierungsgesprächen bis Ende Januar müsse Klarheit herrschen, ob man eine große Koalition bilden könne. SPD-Fraktionschefin Andrea Nahles bremste jedoch die Erwartung an schnelle Gespräche. In einer Forsa-Umfrage sprachen sich 71 Prozent der Deutschen für zügige Beratungen über die Bildung einer großen Koalition aus.

Nachdem der SPD-Parteitag vergangene Woche den Weg für den Start der Gespräche am Mittwoch freigemacht hatte, legte der CDU-Bundesvorstand am Montag seine Positionen fest. Ihre Partei wolle etwa eine Entlastung der Familien, die Gleichwertigkeit der Lebensbedingungen zwischen Stadt und Land, eine Weiterentwicklung der sozialen Sicherungssysteme und eine Fortentwicklung Europas, sagte Merkel. Bei allen Differenzen gebe es mit der SPD eine Reihe von Schnittmengen. Weil man sich gut kenne, sei auch eine so detaillierte Sondierungsarbeit wie mit Grünen und FDP nicht nötig. Es reiche, “Leitplanken” für die Koalitionsgespräche zu beschließen. Man dürfe sich nicht in “Detailfragen der Politik verhaken”, sagte auch Dobrindt.

Unions-Fraktionschef Volker Kauder sagte: “Ich wünsche mir, dass wir zügig arbeiten, dass wir gut vorankommen und sich nicht die Gespräche bis weit in das nächste Jahr hinein ziehen.” Sowohl Merkel wie auch Dobrindt lehnten die von der SPD gewünschte Bürgerversicherung ab. Dobrindt warnte die SPD zugleich vor der Illusion, sich einen Regierungseintritt teuer bezahlen lassen zu können. Dies werde scheitern.

Nahles antwortete auf die Frage, ob sie der CDU-Vorsitzenden Hoffnungen auf zügige Gespräche machen könne: “Nein.” Nach dem für Mittwoch geplanten ersten Treffen werde noch “auf keinen Fall” feststehen, in welche Richtung es gehen werde. “Wir werden am Freitag darüber beraten, ob dieses erste Gespräch uns Anlass zur Hoffnung gibt, dass Sondierungen überhaupt lohnen und ob wir da weitermachen wollen”, sagte Nahles. “Darüber hinausgehende Richtungsentscheidungen erwarte ich nicht.” SPD-Generalsekretär Lars Klingbeil hatte gar von Gesprächen bis womöglich Mai gesprochen.

Nahles betonte, es sei klar, dass die SPD “nichts zu verschenken” habe. Die beim Parteitag bekräftigten Forderungen des Wahlprogramms seien letztlich “keine Steckenpferdchen der SPD”, sondern es handele sich um notwendige Verbesserungen. Als Beispiele nannte Nahles mehr Pflegepersonal, den Abbau der Zwei-Klassen-Medizin und ein sicheres Rentenniveau.

KLARE ABSAGE AN MINDERHEITSREGIERUNG

Merkel pochte ebenso wie Dobrindt auf die Bildung einer stabilen Koalitionsregierung und wies Überlegungen für eine Minderheitsregierung zurück. “Richtig ist, dass eine Minderheitsregierung auf jeden Fall keine stabile Regierung wäre”, sagte Merkel. Dies habe der CDU-Bundesvorstand einhellig so gesehen, sagte sie mit Blick auf das CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Jens Spahn. Dieser hält eine Minderheitsregierung für möglich.

Dobrindt sagte, eine Minderheitsregierung könne allenfalls “ein kurzer Übergang zu Neuwahlen” sein. Der Nachteil wäre, dass die Opposition dann immer die Mehrheit habe. “Die Lage ist eigentlich zu ernst für solche Experimente”, sagte auch Nordrhein-Westfalens Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet (CDU). Er hoffe, dass die SPD ihre “Verweigerungshaltung” aufgebe.

Sollte man Ende Januar feststellen, dass keine große Koalition mit der SPD möglich sei, dürfte es noch vor der Sommerpause Neuwahlen geben, sagte Dobrindt. Merkel betonte, dass sie sich dann erneut zur Wahl stellen würde.

MERKEL SIEHT “HISTORISCHE NOTWENDIGKEIT” FÜR EU-REFORMEN

Sowohl die Kanzlerin als auch die saarländische Regierungschefin Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer begründeten ihre Forderung nach zügigen Verhandlungen auch mit Blick auf die anstehenden EU-Reformen. Sie hoffe, dass Deutschland zudem schnell eine Antwort auf die Europa-Vorschläge von Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron finde, sagte CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Kramp-Karrenbauer in der ARD.

Merkel sprach von einer “historischen Notwendigkeit” für EU-Reformen. In der Europäischen Union gebe es 2018 und vor der Europawahl 2019 ein Fenster, um notwendige Entscheidungen zu treffen. Danach werde dies wieder schwieriger. Mit der SPD gebe es trotz aller Differenzen große Gemeinsamkeiten in der Europapolitik. Sie wolle eine “stabile Regierung, auf deren Basis man am besten mit Frankreich und der EU arbeiten kann”. Deutschland werde rechtzeitig konkrete Antworten auf die Vorschläge Macrons haben.

The House version of a bill that would cut corporate tax rates calls for eliminating a tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasers of electric vehicles. Auto industry and environmental groups are lobbying to save the credit as the House and Senate move to merge their versions of the tax overhaul legislation.

Barra said eliminating the tax credit would affect the way potential electric vehicle buyers calculate the cost of owning one. “It changes the equation,” she told reporters at an event sponsored by the Automotive Press Association of Detroit.

“I‘m a proponent of that staying in” the tax code, Barra said. “That’s what we convey to the administration.”

Nos últimos dois anos, mais de uma dezena de mulheres acusou Trump de realizar avanços sexuais não desejados antes de ele entrar na política.

Três de suas acusadoras, Jessica Leeds, Rachel Crooks e Samantha Holvey, afirmaram em entrevista coletiva nesta segunda-feira que as acusações justificavam nova consideração dada a discussão mais ampla sobre assédio sexual na sociedade norte-americana.

A Brave New Films, produtora de filmes sem fins lucrativos, produziu um vídeo com 16 das acusadoras de Trump e organizou a coletiva de imprensa em Nova York na segunda-feira. No filme, as mulheres acusam Trump de beijá-las sem sua permissão, agarrá-las por suas partes íntimas, colocar as mãos dentro de suas saias ou de fazer outros avanços não desejados.

O Congresso deve “colocar de lado suas afiliações partidárias e investigar o histórico de má conduta sexual do sr. Trump”, disse Crooks, ex-recepcionista de empresa imobiliária, que foi apoiada por Leeds e Holvey.

As mulheres disseram não acreditar que Trump deixará seu cargo por conta das alegações, mas que ele deve ser responsabilizado.

Trump e autoridades da Casa Branca negaram as alegações, algumas das quais datam de 1980.

“Essas falsas afirmações, totalmente contestadas na maioria dos casos por relatos de testemunhas oculares, foram amplamente abordadas na campanha do ano passado e o povo americano expressou seu julgamento ao entregar uma vitória decisiva”, disse um porta-voz da Casa Branca em comunicado divulgado nesta segunda-feira, questionando o momento da solicitação e as motivações políticas das mulheres.

Italian planes targeted a bridge, while the German Kondor legion hit the town with conventional and incendiary bombs, and machine-gunned men, women and children as they ran from the burning town.

The Nazis and fascists were fighting for the forces of General Francisco Franco, in revolt against the elected republican government of Spain, flouting a non-intervention agreement with impunity and helping to bring Spain’s future dictator to victory.

When on trial in Nuremberg after the war, Hermann Goering, chief of the German Air Force, testified that “the Spanish Civil War gave me an opportunity to put my young air force to the test, and a means for my men to gain experience.”

It’s not clear, even now, what Goering (and Benito Mussolini’s) young men were getting experience in; it certainly wasn’t precision bombing. The strategic targets were the bridge and an arms factory. Neither were damaged – nor was the Tree of Guernica, an oak, the original of which was planted in the 14th century, under which the lords of the Basque country swore to uphold freedom for the people. But the 1937 attack killed at least 200 inhabitants (the exact figure is still disputed) and wounded hundreds more. The town, a center of Basque cultural life, was largely destroyed.

There’s a majority view that the attack was a practice exercise for blitzkrieg, the “lightning war” of terror from the air much used by the Luftwaffe to demoralize civilian populations in World War Two. Wolfgang Schmidt, an expert on the air force at the Military History Research Institute in Potsdam, says that ""for the German air force, Guernica was a trial run on how one can spread horror and distress through attacks on cities and towns.”

Guernica stands out from other victims of fascism because Pablo Picasso, born in Spain but living much of his life in France, commemorated it in painting. He set to work immediately after the attack, completing the huge, almost 26-foot wide canvas by June, using only black, white and gray, as if to give it the image of objectivity. His choice of palette was inspired not just to record the horror of the event, but by a piece of reporting, done from the town on the night of the attack, when the flames were still leaping in the streets.

George Steer, a young South African-born journalist, had come to the Basque country to report on the Spanish civil war for The Times of London – this after reporting in 1935 on the brutal Italian invasion of Ethiopia, in which poison gas was extensively used and clearly-marked ambulances bombed from the air. Among the first to arrive in Guernica after the raid, his dispatch from the devastated town relied on the testimony of the survivors.

“The whole town of 7,000 inhabitants, plus 3,000 refugees, was slowly and systematically pounded to pieces,” wrote Steer. “Over a radius of five miles round, a detail of the raiders’ technique was to bomb separate caserios, or farmhouses. In the night these burned like little candles in the hills. All the villages around were bombed with the same intensity as the town itself, and at Mugica, a little group of houses at the head of the Guernica inlet, the population was machine-gunned for 15 minutes.”

The report, at the same time elegant and urgent, with horror conveyed not by hyperbole but through detail, was reproduced round the world – including in Parisian newspapers, where Picasso read it. He then produced, in the monochrome of a newspaper article, a painting which from then until now has lasted as a statement of the brute amorality of fascism.

A few days after Steer, when the fires had become embers, Franco’s nationalists entered the town. With them came the spin-doctors of the day. They ensured that telltale German and Italian shell fragments and bullet cases were removed, and empty oil drums placed about the town. When journalists friendly to Franco were brought in, they were told that the Basques had destroyed their own town by setting it alight – hence the empty oil drums. As Paul Preston writes in his book, “We Saw Spain Die”, most of the reporters followed the lead, and the lie was sent around the world – but in this case, after the truth had already been reported.

The nationalists’ efforts to blame the victims, flimsy (and disgusting) as it was, was believed because those who swallowed it wished to believe it. It exonerated those who perpetrated the attack and confirmed the view of Franco’s supporters that his and their enemies were evil. It’s worth exhuming the brave reporting of those like Steer, for it shows that fake news often originates from those who accuse their enemies of producing it.

This is something Donald Trump now does routinely. The president’s obsession has become so habitual that we are in danger of becoming accustomed to it, and thus ignoring its danger. Those who support him go to extraordinary lengths to show that his enemies, not he or they, are liars. Two weeks ago, a woman, employed by Project Veritas – a conservative group that names itself after the Latin word for “truth” and uses undercover methods to expose what it says is liberal bias in the media – tried to pass herself off to the Washington Post as a victim of Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican running for Senate in a special election on Dec. 12. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls – a charge he denies. The aim was to have the Post report her story, then smear the Post by revealing it as fake.

There’s no suggestion that Trump knew anything of this (or that he’s in General Franco’s league). But Trump doesn’t have to be. He has created a framework in which the quotidian nature of press life is inverted. By calling accurate reporting fake, he elevates fake reporting to the level of truth – however it’s arrived at. Fake news is that which he wants to be believed – and which his supporters wish to believe.

The George Steer school of reporting – seeing with one’s own eyes, asking with one’s own voice, assembling the story with one’s own judgment, governed by a desire for accuracy – is, fortunately, both alive and careful, as the Post’s rejection of the fake harassment story shows. It is that reporting which should be sought out – there’s plenty of it – and relied on. But the commander-in-chief of fakery remains in place, still occupying the bully pulpit, still with millions of followers who wish to believe him.

“It’s a significant amount of crude oil in a market that has been the tightest for crude oil,” Kilduff said.","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, overcoming declines early in the session, after a North Sea pipeline shut for repairs and investors focused on commodities following an explosion in New York.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.29, or about 2 percent, at $64.69 a barrel.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled at $57.99 a barrel, 63 cents or 1 percent above their last settlement.

The difference between the two benchmarks WTCLc1-LCOc1 was the greatest since late October, as Brent rallied after the shutdown of the pipeline that carries the biggest of the five North Sea crude oil streams that underpin the benchmark.

The pipeline, which can carry 450,000 barrels per day of Forties crude from the North Sea to the Kinneil processing terminal in Scotland, has been operating at reduced capacity for about four days before the shutdown.

“It is a supply concern not only because the pipeline transports a significant portion of North Sea crude oil output, but also because it may take weeks before the issue is resolved,” said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

The market had expected the pipeline to return to service quickly and was surprised by the extended shutdown, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

“It’s a significant amount of crude oil in a market that has been the tightest for crude oil,” Kilduff said.

Earlier in the session, both benchmarks popped higher after an explosion rocked New York’s Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the city’s busiest commuter hubs.

Investors tend to head for hard-asset commodity markets like gold and silver during high-risk events, and oil can also attract investment, Kilduff said.

Brent and WTI have gained well over a third from 2017 lows, drawing support from a cut in production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers, including Russia, which has been in place since the start of the year.

During the weekend, Kuwait’s oil minister suggested that an exit from the supply-cut agreement would be studied before June.

The United Arab Emirates energy minister said on Monday that OPEC plans to announce in June an exit strategy from the cuts, though he added it did not mean the pact would end by then.

Gains from the cuts could also be undermined by rising output from the United States, which is not participating in the deal to withhold production.

The number of rigs drilling for new oil in the United States last week rose by two to 751, the highest since September, energy services company Baker Hughes said on Friday.

“The largest concern for investors currently remains the rise in the U.S. rig count,” said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers.

A higher rig count points to a further rise in U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which is already up more than 15 percent since mid-2016 at 9.71 million barrels per day. That is the highest since the early 1970s, and close to the output levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.","Oil gains on Forties Pipeline shutdown, New York blast",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-gains-on-forties-pipeline-shutdown-new-york-blast-idINKBN1E509X

Abul Maal A. Muhith was responding to questions from reporters about a Reuters story on Friday that said Bangladesh Bank had asked the New York Fed to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) RCBS.PS seeking damages.

“The Bangladesh Bank has taken a decision (on filing a suit). They will let me know. We haven’t so far taken any steps as the Philippines government was taking care of it (investigating the heist),” Muhith said.

“But it seems Rizal bank has been playing delinquent. We want to wipe out Rizal bank from the world.”

Unidentified hackers stole the money using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at RCBC and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.

The Philippine central bank fined RCBC a record one billion pesos ($20 million) last year for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through it.

RCBC has said rogue employees were responsible and Philippine prosecutors have filed money laundering charges against a former RCBC bank manager and four people who owned the bank accounts where the funds were sent, but who are not identifiable since the accounts were in fake names. They are the only people to be formally cited anywhere in the world in association with the crime.

May, weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority at a June election, rescued an agreement last week to move the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union on to a second phase after easing the concerns of her Northern Irish allies over the future role of the border with EU member Ireland.

But the discussion of Britain’s trade relationship with the EU after Brexit contains many pitfalls and could widen differences among her top team of ministers, or cabinet, over how Britain should look after it leaves the bloc.

In a statement to parliament, May took to task those who doubted that she could move the talks beyond the initial stage of agreeing terms on how much Britain should pay, citizens’ rights and the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

“This is good news for people who voted leave who were worried we were so bogged down in the tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen,” she told parliament.

“It is good news for people who voted remain who were worried were going to crash out without a deal.”

May will head to Brussels on Thursday for a summit meeting at which she expects the leaders of the other 27 EU states to approve an assessment by negotiators that the sides have made “sufficient progress” to move on to phase two.

TROUBLES AHEAD

The deal to launch further talks looked in jeopardy a week ago when May was forced to abandon a choreographed meeting in Brussels intended to seal the deal after her allies in Northern Ireland expressed fears she was proposing a special status for the region - out of sync with the rest of the United Kingdom.

After days of diplomacy, there was a compromise - if no overall Brexit deal is secured, Britain will keep “full alignment” with those rules of the EU’s single market that help cooperation between Ireland’s north and south.

But those words have reverberated in both London and Belfast, with Brexit minister David Davis saying they were more “a statement of intent” than a legally binding move.

Slideshow (2 Images)

On Monday, Davis told LBC radio his words had been taken out of context and denied he was backing away from the commitment, which the EU described as “a deal between gentlemen”.

“And it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government,” the European Commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels.

Davis’ comments may have been aimed at members of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s Conservative minority government in parliament after the party expressed concerns about how alignment could work without Britain staying in the EU’s single market and customs union.

Or he may have wanted to ease the fears of some campaigners for Britain to leave the EU, who say the possibility of having to follow the bloc’s rules would mean that they would have Brexit in name only.

But May said the commitments made in the first round of talks -- which includes a payment of 35-39 billion pounds over many years to meet EU obligations -- were necessary to sever ties with the bloc.

“In doing so we can move on to building the bold new economic and security relationships that can underpin the new deep and special partnership we all want to see,” she said.

“A partnership between the European Union and a sovereign United Kingdom that has taken control of its borders, money and laws once again.”",PM May hails new optimism in Brexit talks after deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-may/may-hails-new-optimism-in-brexit-talks-after-deal-idUKKBN1E500V

Some observers call the Russian president the Middle East’s New Sheriff and for good reason. Last week, during a series of meetings with the leaders of Syria, Turkey and Iran in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin took the central role in a major diplomatic push to end Syria’s civil war by winning support from Turkey and Iran to host a Syrian peace congress.

The Sochi summit conspicuously did not include delegates from the United States or the European Union. And while its focus was on the Middle East, it’s clear that Putin has expanded his influence beyond the region. In Europe, he destabilized Ukraine by annexing its Crimean peninsula and supporting separatists in the Donbass region after Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Moscow president in 2014. In Asia, he has developed an increasingly close relationship with China. In the United States, charges of Russian interference in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump have dominated Washington’s political landscape and overshadowed the administration’s legislative agenda.

This is an impressive turn of events for the leader of the economically-anemic remnant of a former superpower. Given that Russia’s economy has a GDP of $1.283 trillion – or barely 7 percent the size of America’s – Putin arguably has played a weak hand brilliantly.

But Putin’s apparent successes may turn out to be failures. The view of the Russian leader as a master tactician overlooks how his achievements risk blowing up in his face.

Daniel DePetris: Why the U.S. shouldn't send arms to Ukraine

John Lloyd: What Merkel's political woes mean for the EU

Consider Ukraine: Russia has historically sought to dominate its southern neighbor and Putin remains loath to allow the country to leave Moscow's orbit and join the West. After Russia annexed Crimea, the Kremlin hoped to use a combination of Kremlin agents, local collaborators and irregular Russian soldiers to conquer the entire southern and eastern half of Ukraine. Since Ukraine's military had only 6,000 combat-ready troops Putin's dream of creating this ""Novorossiya"" — or New Russia — seemed within reach.

Unfortunately for Putin, things did not work out as he had planned. While Ukraine is culturally and linguistically split between a Ukrainian-speaking, Europe-oriented western half and a pro-Russian, Russian-speaking eastern area, Putin's war on their country crystallized a sense of national identity. Privately-funded military battalions and civilian volunteers helped the regular army beat back Russian-supported separatists and collaborators, and recent nationwide polls reveal a greater sense of Ukrainian identity than prior to 2014. Support for joining Western institutions like the EU and NATO has also jumped while anti-Russian sentiments have hardened.

Although the Kremlin may hope these trends eventually reverse and pro-Russian leaders like former President Viktor Yanukovych come to power again, that's probably wishful thinking. Moscow's annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine actually removed millions of Russia-friendly voters opposed to NATO and the EU from Ukraine's electorate, making it much more likely Kiev's leaders will eventually make good on their promise to bring Ukraine into the West. Putin may have gained Crimea, but he lost the rest of Ukraine.

Putin's interference in America's elections also hasn't worked out as planned. The Kremlin hoped Trump's election would result in more Russia-friendly policies, but the opposite has occurred. Putin's secret April proposal to completely reset the Russian-American relationship, and to cooperate on a whole series of global issues from Afghanistan to North Korea to cyber security, largely went nowhere. In August, Congress almost-unanimously passed new economic sanctions against Russia – including provisions directly targeting Putin’s oligarch allies – while also barring Trump from lifting previous sanctions without congressional review. Putin hoped Trump's election would weaken NATO, but the president has reaffirmed Washington's commitment to defend NATO allies. Trump has backed this up by continuing to deploy American forces to the Baltics while also sending additional troops to the Polish-Russian border. And, in part due to Trump’s consistent demands, Washington’s European allies are finally increasing their defense budgets.

While the Kremlin may still hold out hope Trump will eventually act on his continued desire to improve ties with Moscow, American domestic politics likely preclude this from happening. Some members of Trump’s own cabinet such as Defense Secretary James Mattis, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and national security adviser H.R. McMaster hold hawkish views on Russia and will probably push back against any attempt by Trump to improve the Russian-American relationship. More importantly, even if Trump wanted to normalize the relationship, the optics of doing so while Trump – and several of his closest relatives and advisors – remains under suspicion for colluding with Moscow’s attempts at electoral interference makes this politically implausible. Indeed, the investigation into Russian meddling provides incentive for Trump to appear tough on Russia to insulate him from accusations that he's a secret Russian puppet – something officials advocating supplying arms to Ukraine are taking advantage of.

Putin establishing closer ties with China also doesn’t represent the threat some Americans fear. The Chinese economy dwarfs Russia's and this economic imbalance likely relegates Russia to the role of junior partner in any possible alliance.

Moscow's military cooperation with China also represents less than meet the eye. Though joint military exercises have increased, these are unlikely to produce any kind of formal anti-Western alliance. Even worse for Putin, Moscow's new willingness to sell Beijing its most advanced arms may actually undermine Russia's long-term geopolitical position. Underlying mistrust between the two Eurasian powers dating back decades still exists, and if one day a revanchist China seeks to reclaim its historic Siberian territory Russia will regret Putin's decision to pursue short-term economic benefit at the expense of its national security.

To be clear, Putin can point to some genuine political accomplishments. Beyond his successful Syrian diplomacy, other key Middle Eastern countries have also been rushing to curry favor with him. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited Putin multiple times, asking him to respect Israel's interests in Syria. And in what many observers considered a historic development, King Salman bin Abdulaziz – accompanied by a 1,500 person delegation – became the first Saudi leader to visit Moscow. The two countries signed multiple agreements, including a remarkable deal for Riyadh to buy Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system.

Investors continued their policy vigil with the Federal Reserve set to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

Toronto-listed cobalt companies, Ecobalt Solutions and Fortune Minerals, are in talks, ranging from preliminary to more advanced, with more than a dozen groups, including car and battery makers, on financing their projects, their chief executives told Reuters.

The interest in miners from downstream players along the battery supply chain - a new area of investment for most - would provide a life-line to miners at time when equity funding for developers remains relatively tight after a five-year downturn on weak metals prices.

“We anticipate additional transactions in the coming months and years. It is a function of demand-supply imbalance,” said John Kanellitsas, President and Vice Chairman of Lithium Americas Corp, which raised nearly $300 million this year for a project in Argentina.

A string of potential financing deals in Canada comes after a handful of predominantly lithium miners in Australia - the world’s biggest lithium producer - secured investment from mainly Chinese automakers and battery makers this year looking to lock in future raw material supply.

For a FACTBOX on recent deals, click:

Lithium mine developers have been able to secure funding earlier than their cobalt peers as fears of a supply shortage started in late 2015, when cobalt was still in surplus.

Like lithium, cobalt’s price has doubled - but most of that upswing has come this year on concerns of multi-year shortfalls in the next decade as demand from the electric vehicle sector surges.

Cobalt’s fortunes are more closely tied to batteries than lithium‘s: about 55 percent of all cobalt goes into battery chemicals compared to about 40 percent for lithium, according to a Dec. 4 BMO Capital Markets report.

Although there are no guarantees that deals will be struck, the cobalt miners, who have been advancing their projects for more than a decade, are in their strongest position yet to secure funding, said Cormark Securities analyst MacMurray Whale.

That is because of deficit forecasts due to constrained supply and expected soaring demand from the electric vehicle market. “All those elements together suggest to me that it can’t be better,” Whale said.

MINING HUB IN CANADA

With more than 1,200 publicly listed mining companies, Canada has long been the global hub for mine developers with projects around the world.

Vancouver-based Ecobalt’s “path forward” is to first sign a long-term supply agreement, called an offtake, with one or more customers to provide a portion of the funds it needs to develop its Idaho cobalt project, CEO Paul Farquharson said in an email.

Once in place, this would significantly lower the risk for the project, making it more attractive for banks to provide debt financing and other investors to fund the balance.

Ecobalt outlined plans on Dec. 7 to produce for offtake a cobalt concentrate, a less-processed cobalt product than initially planned - a step that could slash as much as $100 million, according to analysts, off its previous project capital cost estimate of $187 million.

Ecobalt, whose Idaho project is the only fully-permitted, primary cobalt deposit in the United States, is the most likely of the Canadian cobalt developers to secure financing, possibly within six months, said Eight Capital analyst David Talbot.

Canada’s Nemaska Lithium and Mason Graphite, which both have projects in Quebec, could also secure funding in coming months, Talbot said.

Graphite is another battery ingredient but unlike cobalt and lithium, batteries are not graphite’s main end-use.

Ecobalt’s Idaho project has unique advantages over other projects including that around 75 percent of its revenue will come from cobalt and that it is located in a safe political jurisdiction, Talbot said.

Almost all cobalt is produced as a by-product from copper and nickel mines, meaning output increases are dependant on other markets.

More than half of the world’s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country racked by political instability and legal opacity, and where child labor is used in mines - a worry for automakers looking to secure ethically-sourced battery raw materials.

Fortune, which is seeking more than $700 million to develop its Nico cobalt mine and processing plant in Canada, expects to secure finance in 2018 once it releases a feasibility study on an expanded project, CEO Robin Goad said.

About a quarter of flights at Europe’s biggest airport London Heathrow were canceled, a spokeswoman for the airport said, adding that Sunday’s disruption had caused a knock-on effect, leaving planes and crews in the wrong places.

Hundreds of flights at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport were delayed, while the regional airport of Eindhoven shut completely, cancelling all flights.

Heavy snowfall in the Netherlands led to the closure of schools and businesses and prompted authorities to advise people to stay home. Rail and road networks were hit by icy weather, with some areas expected to get up to 30 cm (12 inches) of snowfall within 24 hours.

Winter enthusiasts took advantage of the rare thick snow, with some out on skis, while school children enjoyed an unexpected day off.

The national Dutch weather institute KNMI issued its highest alert, warning of “extremely dangerous” conditions across the country.

The national railroad operator and government advised people not to take the train or drive if they could avoid it, with up to 15 cm of snowfall expected on Monday afternoon.

Travel was substantially disrupted for a second day across much of Britain, as wintry showers continued following heavy snow on Sunday.

Train services across Wales, central and northern England as well as commuter services into London were severely disrupted. Drivers were warned of treacherous driving conditions with motoring organization the RAC saying that they were expecting to handle 11,000 breakdowns by the end of the day.

China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.

Numerous Chinese fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft conducted “routine” and “planned” distant sea patrols on Monday to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke said on the military branch’s microblog.

H-6K bombers, Su-30 and J-11 fighter jets, and surveillance, alert and refueling aircraft flew over the Miyako Strait in Japan’s south and the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines to “test real combat capabilities”, Shen said.

Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan said in a statement they had dispatched aircraft and ships to monitor the activity of the Chinese military and that the drills were not unusual and people should not be alarmed.

China has conducted numerous similar patrols near Taiwan this year, saying such practices have been normalized as it presses ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores.

Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. Taiwan is well armed, mostly with U.S. weaponry, but has been pressing Washington to sell it more high-tech equipment to better deter China.

In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.

That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would invade Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited Taiwan.

The deal gives the Swiss insurer the top spot in a market attractive to global players due to its robust economy and low penetration, while helping Australia’s No. 4 lender move ahead with a long-planned exit from non-core operations.

Zurich, Europe’s fifth-biggest insurer, also bought Macquarie Group Ltd’s (MQG.AX) life insurance unit for an undisclosed sum in 2016 and the Cover-More Group for $554 million in April. Together with its purchase of ANZ’s OnePath, it will now command 19 percent of Australia’s retail life insurance market.

As part of the agreement, it will also gain access to ANZ’s six million customers through a 20 year distribution agreement to sell life insurance.

The deal “provides a highly cash-generative business that will add to our cash remittances....and support dividend growth beyond that implied by our existing plan”, Zurich Chief Executive Mario Greco said in a statement.

It will increase cash flows by around $225 million over the 2017-2019 planning period, Zurich said, adding that the deal would be paid for with existing cash and senior debt.

The acquisition is the largest since Greco took over at Zurich last year. Brought in from Italy’s Generali (GASI.MI) to engineer a turnaround for the troubled group, Greco has promised to make Zurich leaner and more efficient.

ANZ’s sale comes amid a rush of divestments by Australia’s biggest banks, under pressure from more stringent capital requirements to slim down.

Banks are also seeking to get back to basics after a series of governance scandals, including one where Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) was accused of using outdated medical definitions to refuse life insurance payouts that resulted in a backlash against the whole sector.

“These non-core assets are causing a lot of core headaches,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer of Atlas Funds Management, which holds ANZ shares.

“What they’re concerned about is a bleeding over into their loan book.”

In September, Australia’s biggest lender Commonwealth Bank sold its life insurance unit to Hong Kong-based AIA (1299.HK) for $3.1 billion, while No. 3 lender National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) sold 80 percent of its life insurance unit to Japan’s Nippon Life Insurance last year.

ANZ Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliot said in a statement the bank’s strategy was to “do a few things and do them incredibly well” and that “we are just exiting, shrinking or partnering on everything else”.

The bank sold its pension business in October to Australian pension manager IOOF Holdings (IFL.AX) for A$975 million.

ANZ said it would book an extraordinary loss of about A$520 million from the sale of the life insurance business.

Morneau told reporters that for an initial two years, 75 percent of the money would go to the provinces and 25 percent to Ottawa.

Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau plans to allow recreational marijuana nationwide by July 2018, which will make Canada the first Group of Seven country to do so.

Trudeau says legalization is needed to keep the drug out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.

The federal government had initially suggested a 50-50 revenue split, an idea the provinces rejected on the grounds it was not enough to help cover the extra costs of enforcing the new rules once they take effect.

Morneau said he and his provincial counterparts also agreed to stick to Ottawa’s proposal for a tax on all cannabis products of C$1 (78 cents) per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher.

“Our expectation is that by keeping prices low, we will be able to get rid of the black market. However, that will happen over time,” said Morneau.

The responsibility for setting up networks of stores to actually sell the drug lies with the provinces, who along with some police officials have complained Ottawa is moving too fast toward legalization and not taking extra costs into account.

Morneau said the additional tax revenue would allow the provinces to help meet the costs of municipalities dealing with the pot trade on a daily basis.

He estimated the tax would raise around C$400 million a year for the first two years, at which point Ottawa and the provinces will meet to reassess the initiative.

The federal take will be capped at C$100 million a year, with any revenues exceeding that amount going to the provinces. The finance minister of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said he was very pleased by that part of the deal.

“If there is a surge in the marketplace, we can accommodate it more effectively,” said Charles Sousa.

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.

The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP.

Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.

Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.

“The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”

Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.

Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.

The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.

VOLATILITY CONCERNS

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

There was no lasting market impact from an explosion in New York’s busy Port Authority commuter hub, described by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio as an “attempted terrorist attack”.

Investors continued their policy vigil with the Federal Reserve set to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

The last time the spread was that plump was in 1999.

Yet the euro is currently up 12 percent on the dollar this year, while the dollar is down 8 percent on a basket of currencies .DXY - an indication interest rate differentials aren’t everything in forex.

On Tuesday, the euro was steady at $1.1772 EUR= having failed to clear resistance around $1.1812 overnight. The dollar was idling at 113.48 yen JPY=, just off a one-month top of 113.69.

Dealers at Citi noted interbank volumes in the forex market had been 35 percent below average overnight and another thin session was in prospect for Tuesday.

There was a little more action in bitcoin, which was last at $16,000 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP while its newly minted futures contract <0#XBT:> fell back over a thousand dollars to stand at $17,450.

In commodity markets, gold remained out of favour at $1,244.70 an ounce XAU= having suffered its biggest weekly drop since May last week.

Oil prices pushed ahead after the shutdown of the Forties North Sea pipeline knocked out significant supply from a market that was already tightening due to OPEC-led production cuts.

Tens of thousands of Iraqis came to serve the IS administration, including as doctors, teachers, judges, cooks, and lawyers, arguably contributing to the group’s control of the cities it occupied.

Just as Iraqis were forced to join the Baath party under Saddam Hussein, many in IS-controlled areas say they were forced to join the group to keep their jobs – though no doubt some also supported IS’s extremism.

But today, under Iraqi law – and as urged by various United Nations resolutions – Iraq is trying to prosecute them all. Those convicted face life in prison or the death penalty merely for IS membership. But such broad prosecutions would be a grave mistake if Iraq is ever to establish some modicum of national reconciliation.

There is global sympathy for Iraqi popular demands for justice against the IS criminals who mercilessly, even proudly, caused unimaginable suffering, death, and destruction in Iraq (and Syria) for three years. Our 21st century is now scarred with the modern medievalism of captive Yezidi women sold as slaves and journalists in orange jumpsuits beheaded with giant swords on live camera. Beyond the daily tyranny IS inflicted on Iraqis under their control, from public killings for minor offenses to strict codes of religious conduct ensnaring ordinary families, it caused the deaths and injuries of thousands of Iraqi soldiers deployed to defeat it. And IS militants certainly showed no respect for the laws of war or human decency in how they treated captured Iraqi soldiers.

The UN has established a special investigative team to gather evidence of IS crimes to assist Iraqi courts in their prosecutions. But the international community has chosen to look away from the mass vengeance still under way at the hands of Iraqi soldiers: grotesquely torturing, beating, and executing IS suspects while arbitrarily detaining thousands of IS-related women and children in makeshift camps and prisons.

While this vigilantism in the heat of war may well subside, the trials, jailing, sentencing, and execution of at least 10,000 IS suspects will go on for years, sustaining new grievances for a much greater number of Iraqi families, tribes, and communities. Our research into these prosecutions shows that they are rife with the same due process violations that have for decades tainted the Iraqi judicial system – detention in inhumane conditions based on flimsy evidence; allegations of severe torture to coerce confessions; no prisoner access to lawyers or families, who often don’t even know if their loved one is alive; and summary trials, some lasting as little as 15 minutes but resulting in hastily-issued death sentences.

Sadly, these trials don’t even have the merit of establishing a judicial, historical account of IS’s crimes against the Iraqi people and a real sense of justice for the victims. Instead, the only charge IS suspects regularly face is “membership in Islamic State,” quite easy to prove with a one-sentence confession, but with no effort to establish the full record of crimes, such as genocide under international law or rape and murder under Iraqi criminal law. There’s no strategy to prioritize prosecution of those most responsible for the gravest abuses, instead of the “first in, first out” factory-line process, where, as one senior Iraqi judge insisted to us, “the Islamic State cook is as guilty as the Islamic State fighter.”

Victims of IS crimes, who should be able to testify about abuses they suffered and have the satisfaction of seeing the wrongdoers face justice in a court of law, are not included in these trials, leaving a vast disconnect between victims and the justice system. We already know that Iraqi courts have prosecuted at least 7,282 IS suspects under the counter-terrorism laws, and executed 92. Without a dramatic shift in approach, we will see hundreds more, if not thousands, executed, and ten times that number clogging Iraqi courts and prisons for decades.

Peter Van Buren: The problem with a post-Tillerson State Department

Josh Cohen: Don't call Putin a genius

There is an alternative to this disappointing and dangerous outcome and it is well within Iraq’s practical reach, if not within its immediate political will. Iraq can, and should, find alternatives to prosecution for the thousands of IS suspects who carried out no serious crimes or acts of violence. Let’s face it: The reasons someone may have joined IS are complex and touch upon a long history of Sunni isolation, for which many in Iraq are to blame.

A better (though no doubt imperfect) way to address the community betrayal such membership most deeply represents is to allow these IS members to participate in a national truth-telling mechanism that can also create a meaningful record of IS crimes, and to make amends through service to the Iraqi communities to which they and their families ultimately belong. There is ample precedent for this. In many other post-conflict situations, governments have decided to choose such alternatives to prosecution as the best way forward. Given the deeply fractured state of Iraqi society, this may also be its best chance to unite and rebuild a peaceful country.",Commentary: Why Iraq should limit Islamic State trials,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-whitson-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-why-iraq-should-limit-islamic-state-trials-idUSKBN1DZ29V

The 24-year-old Wentz, who was expected to be an NFL MVP candidate this season, underwent an MRI on Monday morning after suffering the knee injury in Sunday’s 43-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams.

It usually takes a player six to nine months to recover from the required surgery.

Wentz was injured when he took a big hit on a third-quarter touchdown run that was called back because of a penalty. He came up limping after absorbing multiple hits on the run but stayed in the game and threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery four plays later to give the Eagles the lead.

Wentz was 23-of-41 passing for 291 yards and four touchdowns with one interception before leaving the game.

Nick Foles replaced Wentz on the next drive for the Eagles (11-2), who clinched the NFC East title with Sunday’s victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for their first division title since 2013.

Foles, who was 6 of 10 for 42 yards after coming into the game, will now be the starting quarterback.

“The reason we went out and got Nick Foles are for reasons like this,” Pederson told reporters in his press conference Monday. “I hate it for Carson, and the season he’s having.”

With his four touchdowns passes Sunday, Wentz now has 33 to move past Sonny Jurgensen for the most TDs in a single season in franchise history, a record that stood since 1961. Wentz completed 60.2 percent of his passes for 3,296 yards with just seven interceptions in 13 games this season.

The Eagles next face the New York Giants this Sunday before a Christmas Day game against the Oakland Raiders and a season finale against the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 31.

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and executive at the right-wing Breitbart News site, joined Moore in Midland City for the Monday night rally, labeled a “Drain the Swamp” event, in an echo of Trump’s 2016 campaign pledge to get rid of Washington insiders.

“I want to make America great again with President Trump,“ Moore said. ”I want America great, but I want America good, and she can’t be good until we go back to God.”

Moore, a 70-year-old conservative Christian and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, has been accused by several women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14.

Moore has denied any misconduct. Reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations.

The Alabama race has divided Trump’s Republican Party.

The sexual misconduct accusations prompted many senior Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to distance themselves from Moore.

”There’s a special place in hell for Republicans who should know better,” Bannon told the rally, framing the Alabama election as a showdown between establishment elites and populist power.

A Fox News Poll conducted on Thursday and released on Monday put Jones ahead of Moore, with Jones potentially taking 50 percent of the vote and Moore 40 percent. Fox said 8 percent of voters were undecided and 2 percent supported another candidate.

An average of recent polls by the RealClearPolitics website showed Moore ahead by a slight margin of 2.2 percentage points.

Trump taped a “robo-call” that the campaign has rolled out urging voters to back the Republican candidate in order to help support the president’s agenda.

Democrats also made robo-calls using two of their party’s own big guns - former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden.

‘RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY’

Jones has said he wanted to be a “voice for reason” for Alabama and has touted a record that includes prosecuting former Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham in which four girls were killed.

Jones has spent the past week rallying African-Americans, the most reliably Democratic voters in the state, and hammering Moore in television ads. He has told supporters that his campaign is a chance to be on the “right side of history for the state of Alabama.”

If Jones wins on Tuesday, Republicans would control the Senate by a slim 51-49 margin, giving Democrats much-needed momentum ahead of the November 2018 congressional elections, when control of both chambers of Congress will be at stake.

Moore’s campaign has cast Jones as a liberal out of step with Alabama voters, seizing on the Democrat’s support of abortion rights.

Many Republican officials in Alabama, including Governor Kay Ivey, say they will vote for Moore. But the state’s senior Republican senator, Richard Shelby, said he did not vote for Moore and instead backed a write-in candidate on his absentee ballot, telling CNN that Alabama “deserves better” than Moore.

Moore, who was twice removed from the state Supreme Court for refusing to abide by federal law, may find a chilly reception in Washington if he wins. Republican leaders have said

Moore could face an ethics investigation if Alabama voters send him to the U.S. Senate.

Democrats have signaled they may use Moore’s election to tar Republicans as insensitive to women’s concerns at a time when allegations of sexual harassment have caused many prominent men working in politics, entertainment, media and business to lose their jobs.",Republican Moore embraces Trump message on eve of Alabama election,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-alabama/republican-moore-embraces-trump-message-on-eve-of-alabama-election-idINKBN1E511X?il=0

Das Ministerium prüfe derzeit unterschiedliche Optionen für die Ablösung des Tornados ab 2025, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Verteidigungsstaatssekretär Ralf Brauksiepe an die Grünen-Abgeordnete Franziska Brantner, das Reuters am Montag vorlag. “Primär wird dabei das europäische Kampfflugzeug Eurofighter betrachtet, sekundär auch drei US-amerikanische Muster”. Bei den drei US-Maschinen handle es sich um die F-15 und die F-18 von Boeing sowie die F-35 von Lockheed Martin. Das Ministerium stellt sich damit gegen Luftwaffen-Chef Karl Müllner, der kürzlich eine Präferenz für die F-35 geäußert hatte.

Brantner schickte eine Anfrage an das Verteidigungsministerium und erkundigte sich, ob die Bundesregierung die Haltung des Luftwaffen-Inspekteurs teile. Das Ministerium verneinte dies. “Die vom Inspekteur der Luftwaffe dargestellte Auffassung zur Eignung der F-35 Lightning II als besonders geeignete Nachfolge für das Waffensystem Tornado ist nicht die Position der Bundesregierung”, schrieb Brauksiepe. Die Bundesregierung werde erst nach Abschluss ihrer Prüfungen entscheiden, welcher Jet den Tornado ablösen solle.

Der Tornado spielt in der Bundeswehr eine Sonderrolle, da er auch die Aufgabe der nuklearen Teilhabe erfüllt. Im Krisenfall würde er amerikanische Atombomben zum Ziel tragen. Hält die Bundesregierung an der nuklearen Teilhabe fest, müsste nach der Außerdienststellung des Tornado ein anderer Jet diese Aufgabe übernehmen und dafür technisch gerüstet werden.

DEUTSCHLAND UND FRANKREICH WOLLEN NEUEN JET ENTWICKELN

Zugleich bekräftigte das Verteidigungsministerium die Absicht Deutschlands und Frankreichs, gemeinsam einen Kampfjet zum Ersatz des aktuellen Eurofighters beziehungsweise der Rafale von Dassault in Frankreich zu entwickeln. “Dieses Projekt ist ein wichtiger Meilenstein in der Kontinuität der engen und richtungsweisenden Zusammenarbeit dieser beiden Nationen für Europa”, schrieb Brauksiepe. “Die Bundesregierung ist fest entschlossen, die Entwicklung eines gemeinsamen Waffensystems voranzutreiben; erste gemeinsame Aktivitäten haben bereits begonnen.” Nach früheren Planungen wollen beide Länder bis Mitte 2018 einen gemeinsamen Fahrplan für die Entwicklung des Jets erarbeiten.

Mit Blick auf die Tornado-Nachfolge hatte Luftwaffen-Chef Müllner im November indirekt eine Präferenz für die F-35 erkennen lassen. “Aus militärischen Gesichtspunkten brauchen wir eine geringe Radar-Signatur und die Fähigkeit, aus großer Distanz Ziele zu erkennen und zu bekämpfen”, sagte er in einem Reuters-Interview. Diese Fähigkeiten eines Kampfjets der fünften Generation seien für eine glaubhafte Abschreckung im Rahmen der Landes- und Bündnisverteidigung unerlässlich. Nach Einschätzung von Militärexperten erfüllt aktuell allein die amerikanische F-35 diese Anforderungen.

“Die Risiken und Kosten für den Betrieb des Tornados werden gegen Ende des nächsten Jahrzehnts so erheblich steigen, dass man sich jetzt um eine Nachfolge kümmern muss”, sagte Müllner. Ab 2025 brauche die Luftwaffe die ersten neuen Jets, um den Tornado nach und nach abzulösen. Um diesen Zeitplan halten zu können, wäre nach Müllners Worten eine Grundsatzentscheidung in der ersten Hälfte der Legislaturperiode sowie ein Vertrag 2020 nötig. Den Bedarf der Luftwaffe gab Müllner mit “vielleicht hundert Flugzeugen” an. Die Luftwaffe besitzt 85 Tornado-Jets, die ab den 1970er-Jahren gebaut wurden.

(Reuters) - Firefighters, taking advantage of a lull in the winds, on Monday held in check a massive Southern California wildfire that has torched hundreds of buildings and charred an area larger than New York City.

The Thomas Fire ignited a week ago and has burned 231,700 acres, in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, about 100 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) officials said at a news conference. It continued to grow on Monday, but at a slower pace, burning an additional several hundred acres.

The fire threatens 18,000 structures, including some in the wealthy enclave of Montecito where a number of celebrities have their homes.

Hot and dry Santa Ana winds, which blow from the deserts to the ocean, allowed the fire to explode in size last week. But gusts were light on Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Kathy Hoxsie said, even though the air was warm and dry.

The fire crept along ridge lines above Montecito and the city of Santa Barbara, and firefighters were bracing to keep it from coming downhill into those communities, officials said.

Most of the nearly 900 homes, outbuildings and businesses destroyed by the fire are in neighboring Ventura County, where the blaze first erupted.

Arthur Hurtz, 59, is among the local residents coming to terms with being homeless. He fled from his house in the city of Ventura overlooking the Pacific Ocean last week, just minutes before a wall of flames engulfed it, he said.

“It’s completely gone. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Hurtz, who is now staying at an emergency shelter.

The fire, in addition to destroying buildings, has damaged about 180 structures and ranks as the fifth-largest wildfire on record in California, according to Cal Fire.

The fire, for which investigators were still seeking to determine the cause, was 20 percent contained on Monday evening, up from 15 percent earlier in the day.

Public schools in Santa Barbara and some school systems nearby have canceled classes this week and will not reconvene until the annual winter break is completed in January, said Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider.

“Our house is under threat of being burned,” DeGeneres wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “We just had to evacuate our pets.”

A spokesman for DeGeneres declined to provide any other details on Monday.

Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground.

The Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were both at least 90 percent contained, officials said, while the Skirball Fire in the posh Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles was 85 percent contained.

North of San Diego, the 4,100-acre (1,660 hectare) Lilac Fire was also 90 percent contained on Monday, after destroying 151 structures.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content.

On Monday, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts under the new rules. The agencies said the proposal will “return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs.”

Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “will work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”

Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block, throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said the agreement “is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.”

The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. ”The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said “FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact -- many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed.”

Chris Lewis, vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC is “joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public. This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you.”

Democrats and net neutrality advocates plan a series of protests ahead of Thursday’s vote. Pai’s proposal has already won the backing of the three Republicans on the five-member commission.

But David and Iona Stent, who sold their English home three years ago to start anew in the sun-kissed vineyards of France’s Dordogne, are having none of it.

The couple are frustrated as London inches ahead in its divorce with the European Union, and say Friday’s interim deal offers them scant reassurance for the future of their “Franglais Foods” market stall business.

Under the agreement, the 1.2 million Britons with permanent residence in EU states will be allowed to stay and receive the same treatment over social security, healthcare and employment as the 3 million Europeans living in Britain.

But the deal was only sealed with a handshake.

“It is just words from politicians. It gives me no confidence at all,” said Iona, who sells fudge, Scottish cakes and quiches in the bastide village of Eymet and surrounding areas.

The couple are determined to stay in France. If they can, they will apply for French citizenship, but they are not sure if they will be eligible.

Eymet’s warm climate, good wine and cheap, tumbledown farmhouses have been a magnet for British expatriates since the 1970s. The village boasts an English pub, tea room and a grocery store offering Marmite, Heinz Baked Beans and custard powder. There is even a cricket club.

While Friday’s deal outlined the terms of Britain’s separation from the EU, pitfalls lie ahead. Tough discussions over Britain’s trade relationship with the bloc could widen differences within Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet over how Britain should look after it leaves.

“We don’t know what situation we’ll find ourselves in,” said Iona. “We joke about turning up at the ‘Jungle’ (migrant camp) in Calais. We’ve got this idea they’re going to reinstate it for all the Brits.”

On the far side of the medieval village’s central Place Gambetta, clipped English accents fill ‘Le Treize’ cafe as Stephen and Liz Chorlton ponder their pension income.

Britain’s pound has fallen 13 percent against the euro since the vote to leave the EU, eroding UK-based earnings, pensions and investment incomes.

“We’ve got nothing left in the UK other than a few savings,” said Stephen, 60, who quit his job in Manchester in 2010 after the finiancial crisis hit the shop-fitting industry and moved to southwestern France.

Sterling’s slump means he and his wife now juggle drawing down their pound-denominated private pensions and tapping the income they earn from a French investment fund.

“I had a conversation with my financial adviser last week. He reckons I could live until I am in my 90s and says if I keep drawing out at the level I‘m allowed, my spending will be unsustainable,” said Liz.

FRENCH NATIONALITY

There are about 300 Britons among Eymet’s 2,600-strong population, a number which swells in the summer.

Many lament the divisive nature of the Brexit debate in Britain. Others fume at former prime minister David Cameron’s decision to hold the vote in the first place and what they see and the incoherence of his successor’s negotiating strategy.

“None of us got the vote. It’s like being shat on from a great height and we have no say about it,” said pensioner Andrew Cardle as carafes of wine lubricated a game of indoor-skittles between The Sinners and Eymet Cricket Club.

For all the uncertainty, few Britons in Eymet believe they will be thrown out. “The influx of foreigners here pulled Eymet back from the dead,” said Keith Mcbride, a 54-year-old former City broker with a broad Essex accent and two golden labradors.

“Come Brexit, no one knows what the rules will be,” he said. “But they’re not going to backtrack and say people who are in the system are now out of the system, because we pay contributions.”

Nonetheless, some are contemplating an insurance policy: French nationality.

“If I have to I’ll take (French) citizenship. Piece of cake, if I can pass that bloody language exam,” said David Horlock, who runs a small plastering business.

In a sign some in Britain are still considering a move to France before Brexit hits, Terrie Simpson, whose Agence Eleonor estate agency has seen revenues rise over the past two years, said there was still demand from Britons.

“We’ve had people come in and say we’re so fed up with Brexit that we want to buy a house in France,” said Simpson, whose office front door carries a sticker in the colours of the EU flag reading: “Bollox to Brexit”.

“It might sound arrogant to say they need the English here, but they do. They spend their money in the restaurants, their money is in the banks and young families pay taxes and send their children to the school,” said Simpson.

Many locals do fret that the shutters will come down on Eymet’s cafes and local businesses if Brexit leads to an exodus of Britons.

“If the are no English here, we’re screwed!” said cheesemonger Philippe Barbe. “They’re a big part of our local economy.”","In Dordogne idyll, Brits unimpressed with Brexit talks",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-dordogne/in-dordogne-idyll-brits-unimpressed-with-brexit-talks-idUKKBN1E51W6

“My vote maybe doesn’t change anything,” said gardener Hector Machado, 64, who voted for the opposition in Tachira state.","CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro has set his sights on Venezuela’s 2018 presidential election after the ruling Socialist Party dominated mayoral polls with the help of a partial boycott by a divided opposition.

Enjoying a political breather after a year of ferocious domestic protests and damaging foreign sanctions, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said the government had won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships in Sunday’s election.

Latest official results gave him 21 of 23 state capitals as well as Caracas’ main district, with full results due later on Monday. The landslide win for the socialists was no surprise, given three of the biggest opposition parties did not field candidates.

The elections left Maduro favorite to be the socialist candidate in next year’s presidential race, despite the ambitions of rivals within government and an economic crisis that has pummeled the OPEC nation since his 2013 election.

“Let’s get ready for 2018!” he told cheering supporters in a Caracas square shortly before midnight on Sunday, next to a statue of Venezuela’s independence hero Simon Bolivar.

Maduro also declared fixing Venezuela’s broken economy a priority. But opponents and even some government dissenters say it is his stubborn adherence to Chavez-era economic policies, such as currency controls, that is to blame for the crisis.

Venezuela’s 30 million people are enduring one of the worst economic meltdowns in recent Latin American history. Millions are skipping meals, missing medicines, and lining up for hours at shops during acute shortages and crippling inflation.

Opposition parties said Sunday’s vote was full of irregularities and meaningless, and reiterated demands for changes to the electoral system for the 2018 vote.

“What we saw yesterday was an electoral farce that in no way represents the will of the people,” said Popular Will party leader Juan Andres Mejia, citing abuse of state resources and coercion of government employees to vote.

MADURO ‘WELL-POSITIONED’ FOR RE-ELECTION

Three of the opposition coalition’s main parties - Popular Will, Justice First and Democratic Action - boycotted Sunday’s polls, saying the election board was a pawn of the government.

Picture taken December 10, 2017. Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS

But other opposition parties did put up candidates, adding to confusion and acrimony within opposition ranks.

Maduro said the three abstaining parties should be banned from participating in future elections. That brought a rebuke from the U.S. State Department, which called his remarks “another extreme measure to close democratic space in Venezuela and consolidate power in his authoritarian dictatorship.”

Venezuela’s presidential election has traditionally been held in December, but there is speculation in political circles that it will be brought forward to the first half of 2018 so the socialists can take advantage of the opposition’s disarray.

“Despite the regime’s economic incompetence and the inherent weaknesses of Maduro’s authoritarianism, he is well positioned to achieve re-election next year,” said Nicholas Watson, of the Teneo Intelligence consultancy.

With its most popular leaders barred - Leopoldo Lopez is under arrest and Henrique Capriles is prohibited from office - the opposition may struggle to find a flagbearer.

Uniting parties and reigniting enthusiasm among despondent grassroots supporters will also be huge challenges.

Street protests earlier in 2017 put pressure on Maduro and left 125 people dead. Foreign pressure hardened too, with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing sanctions on Venezuela for alleged government rights abuses and corruption.

Yet after facing down demonstrators, pushing through a controversial legislative superbody in a July vote also boycotted by the opposition, and notching a majority in October gubernatorial polls, Maduro has ridden out the storm for now.

“I think the current government can fix things if they are allowed to get on with it,” said mechanic Melix Jordan, 56, voting for the government in a rural part of Paraguana.

Social discontent is running deep, however. There is no sign so far of an alternative presidential candidate, despite calls in some quarters for popular billionaire businessman Lorenzo Mendoza to run.

“My vote maybe doesn’t change anything,” said gardener Hector Machado, 64, who voted for the opposition in Tachira state. “But I still have hope for something better next year.”","Buoyed by mayoral votes, Venezuela socialists eye presidency race",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1E4044-OCATP

Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC.

The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.

Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended.

“When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”

Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment.

The Yankees introduced their prize signing at the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando on Monday, Stanton saying it was time to move on and grab a chance at winning a championship, while the Marlins undertake another round of rebuilding in Miami.

“It’s going to be a great new chapter in my life and my career,’ Stanton said after donning a pinstriped No. 27 jersey.

“I‘m very excited to be here and to be a part of the Yankees, and I‘m just looking forward to stepping up and being with this winning environment and winning culture.”

The 28-year-old Stanton’s 59 home runs were the highest total in the Majors since 2001, when San Francisco Giants’ Barry Bonds hit 73 and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs 64.

“You add the National League MVP to what we feel like is already a very strong lineup, the possibilities start to run through your head of what that could look like.”

Judge and Stanton will become only the second pair of team mates to have each hit at least 50 home runs in the previous season, joining the 1962 world champion Yankees who featured Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle.

The trade also marks the second time in MLB history that a reigning MVP has been acquired via trade prior to the start of the following season.

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.29 a barrel at 0253 GMT, up 60 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last close.

That marks the first time Brent has risen above $65 since June, 2015.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $58.30 a barrel, up 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement.

“Brent crude raced higher ... as news broke that the North Sea’s Forties Pipeline system would have to be shut down for a ‘number of weeks’ after a hairline crack was found in it,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “The pipeline ... is a significant component underpinning the Brent benchmark.”

Britain’s Forties oil pipeline, the country’s largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were revealed.

“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.

GOING WIDE

The jump in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices to almost $7 a barrel, up from around $5 last week, making U.S. oil exports more attractive. CL-LCO1=R

The cheaper WTI is also a result of rising U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.71 million bpd, levels not seen since the early 1970s.

U.S. production is now also not far off that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The rising U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, to support prices by withholding supplies.

Of adults who were aware of the plan being considered by Congress, 49 percent said they were opposed to it, a sentiment that has not changed much in the past few weeks, the poll showed.

In addition to the 49 percent who said they opposed the Republican tax bill, 31 percent said they supported it and 20 percent said they “don’t know,” according to the online opinion poll of 1,499 adults conducted Dec. 3 to 7, with 1,138 adults saying they were aware of the tax legislation. A poll taken at the end of November also showed 49 percent opposed to the plan.

Tax negotiators are trying to reconcile the differences between separate bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, then to send a final bill to President Donald Trump, who want to sign it into law before year’s end.

Accomplishing this feat would represent the Republicans’ first major legislative victory since they took control of both chamber of Congress and the White House in January.

Republican tax legislation would slash the corporate tax rate, eliminate some taxes paid only by rich Americans and offer a mixed bag of temporary cuts to other individuals and families.

Trump, who is expected to give a speech on the tax overhaul on Wednesday, praised it in a tweet on Sunday by saying the “end result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!”

When asked about Trump’s handling of tax policy, 53 percent of those polled said they disapproved, 38 percent approved and 9 percent said they “don’t know,” the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.

Chinese banks extended 1.12 trillion yuan ($169.27 billion) in net new yuan loans in November, data from the People’s Bank of China showed on Monday, well above analysts’ expectations.

Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 800 billion yuan, from October’s 663.2 billion yuan. The November figure was well above the highest forecast in the poll.

“New loans exceeded expectations due to strong corporate financing demand, with medium- and long-term corporate and household loans expanding sharply,” Zheng Lianghai, an analyst at Caitong Fund Management said.

Analysts also attributed the jump in new loans to an ongoing regulatory crackdown on off-balance sheet lending, which is forcing banks to issue more formal loans, and to a recent rout in China’s bond markets which has made it tougher for companies to raise money by issuing bonds.

The November credit splurge brought China’s total new lending so far this year to 12.94 trillion yuan, more than Italy’s GDP and exceeding 2016’s record 12.65 trillion yuan with one month left to go.

CRACKDOWN

China is in the second year of a campaign to contain and reduce systemic threats to its financial system, with the central bank keeping liquidity tight as it seeks to flush out speculative financing and force growth-obsessed local governments to keep their debt levels under control.

Still, the world’s second-largest economy remains heavily reliant on credit, and analysts agree more painful structural reforms are needed on top of current efforts to force banks and companies to cut debt levels.

Regulators unveiled sweeping new rules last month for the asset management industry to discourage riskier practices. They also started targeting micro loans in a bid to curb short-term household debt, which is low but rising rapidly.

Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 620.5 billion yuan in November from 450.1 billion yuan in October, according to Reuters calculations based on the central bank’s data.

Household loans accounted for 55 percent of total new loans percent last month, down from 68 percent in October.

Corporate loans rose to 522.6 billion yuan in November from 214.2 billion yuan a month earlier.

Broad M2 money supply (M2) in November grew 9.1 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts for an expansion of 8.9 percent and picking up from 8.8 percent in October, which was the slowest pace since records began in 1996.

China’s central bank has said a slowdown in M2 growth could be a “new normal” due to official deleveraging efforts in the financial system and has urged markets not to read to much into the cooler growth.

Authorities are walking a fine line, however, as they try to curb risks without pushing borrowing costs too high, which could slow economic growth and roil financial markets.

The government’s push to reduce risks has triggered several sell-offs in bonds already this year, with the most recent jitters spilling over into the stock market.

A central bank adviser said in November that he expected the government’s financial clampdown to be less forceful next year.

CREDIT GROWTH SLOWING?

Outstanding yuan loans at the end of November grew 13.3 percent from a year earlier, faster than an expected 13 percent rise.

However, despite another record year for bank lending, some analysts said the pace of broad credit expansion has been slowing due to the government’s “de-risking” drive.

“The upshot is that tighter monetary conditions have driven a persistent decline in credit growth in recent quarters, with this slowdown accelerating last month,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.

“We think the drag on economic activity from this slowdown in credit creation will eventually trigger a renewed round of monetary easing.”

If the tightening campaign is sustained and financing costs continue to slowly rise, analysts polled by Reuters believe China’s growth will cool to around 6.6 percent this quarter and 6.4 percent in 2018, from a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the year.

SHADOW BANKING

China’s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 1.6 trillion yuan ($241.82 billion) last month from 1.04 trillion yuan in October.

TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.

That can provide hints of activity in China’s vast and unregulated shadow banking sector, which authorities have also been targeting in their campaign to reduce systemic risks.

Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers’ acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking finance, rose to 173 billion yuan in November from 107 billion yuan in October, according to Reuters calculations.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) was responding to comments on Saturday by Bangladesh Finance Minister Abul Maal A. Muhith who said he wanted to “wipe-out” the Manila-based bank.

The comments follow a Reuters story that Bangladesh Bank (BB) had asked the New York Federal Reserve of New York to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against RCBC seeking damages, according to several sources.

“RCBC has revealed everything it legally could to the (Philippine) Senate and its regulator, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. BB however, has concealed everything it could. The contrast is telling,” George dela Cuesta, head of legal affairs at RCBC, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Unidentified hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the New York Fed in February last year, using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.

Nearly two years later, there is no word on who was responsible and Bangladesh Bank has been able to retrieve only about $15 million, mostly from a Manila junket operator.

“BB is definitely partly to blame for the heist. Its refusal to be transparent is a continuing cover-up and a disservice to global efforts to combat cybercrime,” dela Cuesta said. “RCBC is clearly a victim of BB’s negligence.”

RCBC has blamed rogue employees and Philippine prosecutors have filed money laundering charges against a former RCBC bank manager and four people who owned the bank accounts where the funds were sent, but are not identifiable since the accounts were in fake names. They are the only people to be formally cited anywhere in the world in association with the crime.

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.

The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP.

Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.

Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.

“The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”

Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.

Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.

The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.

VOLATILITY CONCERNS

Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.

“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.

The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.

While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.

“Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”

Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION’

As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.

There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.

Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.

“(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.

The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.

The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

DRAMATIC GAINS

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.

Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.

“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.

Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.

Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.

The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.

Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.

The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

The 783 charges against Zuma relate to a 30 billion rand ($2.20 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s. They were filed but then dropped by the NPA shortly before Zuma ran for the presidency.

South Africa’s High Court reinstated the charges last year and the Supreme Court upheld that decision in October, rejecting an appeal by Zuma and describing the NPA’s decision to set aside the charges as “irrational”.

It then fell to Abrahams, appointed by Zuma as chief state prosecutor in 2015, to decide whether or not the NPA would pursue a case against Zuma.

Abrahams gave Zuma until the end of November to make representations to prevent the charges being brought against him. Abrahams has not commented on whether Zuma presented any submissions of what decision he has taken on the matter.

“They must submit their representation on the 31st of January,” said NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku, referring to Zuma’s lawyers who requested an extension from the Nov. 30 deadline.

Last week the High Court ruled that Zuma’s appointment of Abrahams as state prosecutor was not valid and should be set aside immediately. Zuma said he would appeal the court’s ruling.

Mfaku said Abrahams would remain in office until the appeal is determined.

Il Milan è settimo in classifica dopo 16 giornate, a undici punti dalla zona Champions.","MILANO, 11 dicembre (Reuters) - Nell‘ambito dell‘esame della proposta di voluntary agreement sul fair play finanziario presentata dal Milan all‘Uefa , quest‘ultima ha chiesto alla società di rifinanziare il debito con Elliott prima dell‘accordo e di fornire delle garanzie bancarie sulle perdite previste.

Lo ha detto l‘AD della società rossonera Marco Fassone ai microfoni di ‘Radio Anch‘io Sport’ su Radio Uno, sottolineando come si tratti di “richieste che nessun club sarebbe in grado di poter sostenere”.

“Ci sono un paio di richieste che la Uefa ci ha fatto che ritengo, riteniamo, siano impossibili da accontentare se fossero richieste vincolanti, questo ancora non lo sappiamo”, ha precisato l‘AD del Milan, che resta in attesa della decisione dell‘Uefa.

“Una (richiesta) è quella di completare il rifinanziamento del debito prima di sottoscrivere il voluntary, l‘altra è quella di produrre delle garanzie bancarie, delle fideiussioni a prima richiesta, relative alle perdite previste nei nostri piani, che sono due richieste che nessun club sarebbe in grado di poter sostenere”.

Sono attualmente in corso le trattative per rifinanziare il debito da 128 milioni di euro del club nei confronti di Elliott, contestualmente a quello da 180 milioni della holding lussemburghese Rossoneri Sport Investment -- che fa capo al nuovo proprietario cinese Li Yonghong -- con lo stesso fondo.

I prestiti scadono ad ottobre 2018 ed hanno un tasso d‘interesse medio di poco inferiore al 10%. In caso di mancato rispetto degli impegni, Elliott diverrebbe il proprietario del club.

Se la decisione sul voluntary agreement -- opportunità introdotta di recente e riservata ai club che hanno cambiato proprietario -- non dovesse essere favorevole, Fassone ha spiegato che il Milan ricadrebbe nel regime di settlement agreement, in cui sono previste delle sanzioni (ad esempio limiti al calciomercato e al monte ingaggi), unitamente a un piano di rientro nei parametri finanziari Uefa.

PROGETTO LI E’ LUNGO NEL TEMPO

L‘AD ha inoltre speso parole rassicuranti rispetto alla nuova proprietà, subentrata a Fininvest lo scorso aprile. “Il progetto che mister Yonghong Li ha e il gruppo cinese di suo riferimento ha è estremamente lungo nel tempo, non credo abbiano la minima intenzione di cedere la società”.

“Può essere che magari, in prospettiva o in futuro, se dovessero cambiare delle regolamentazioni interne del governo cinese possano esserci o ricrearsi delle condizioni perché lui abbia dei soci come doveva essere all‘inizio in Cina ma per il momento non vedo nebbie o nubi particolari sul futuro della società”.

EUROPA LEAGUE VALE 30 MLN IN MENO DI CHAMPIONS

Nelle stime fornite da Fassone, se il Milan quest‘anno si qualificherà all‘Europa League avrà un fatturato più basso di 30 milioni di euro rispetto allo scenario di una qualificazione alla più ricca Champions League, il cui ingresso è riservato alle prime quattro classificate in campionato.

“Vorrebbe dire per noi l‘anno prossimo avere una trentina di milioni in meno disponibili sul mercato. In quel caso lì o compri un giocatore in meno o vendi un giocatore in più”, ha concluso Fassone.

Il Milan è settimo in classifica dopo 16 giornate, a undici punti dalla zona Champions.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) was responding to comments on Saturday by Bangladesh Finance Minister Abul Maal A. Muhith who said he wanted to “wipe-out” the Manila-based bank.

The comments follow a Reuters story that Bangladesh Bank (BB) had asked the New York Federal Reserve of New York to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against RCBC seeking damages, according to several sources.

“RCBC has revealed everything it legally could to the (Philippine) Senate and its regulator, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. BB however, has concealed everything it could. The contrast is telling,” George dela Cuesta, head of legal affairs at RCBC, said in a statement on Tuesday.

Unidentified hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the New York Fed in February last year, using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.

Nearly two years later, there is no word on who was responsible and Bangladesh Bank has been able to retrieve only about $15 million, mostly from a Manila junket operator.

“BB is definitely partly to blame for the heist. Its refusal to be transparent is a continuing cover-up and a disservice to global efforts to combat cybercrime,” dela Cuesta said. “RCBC is clearly a victim of BB’s negligence.”

RCBC has blamed rogue employees and Philippine prosecutors have filed money laundering charges against a former RCBC bank manager and four people who owned the bank accounts where the funds were sent, but are not identifiable since the accounts were in fake names. They are the only people to be formally cited anywhere in the world in association with the crime.

RCBC was fined a record one billion pesos ($20 million) by the country’s central bank last year for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through it.

Last month the speculation was on how soon United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley would replace Tillerson. Last week, a fresh burst of reports signaled the end for the secretary – who has not denied he once called Trump a “moron” – and named CIA director Mike Pompeo as a favorite to succeed him.

Trump was quick to tweet out a response: “The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!” Trump may be sincere, or he may be buying time to avoid confrontational confirmation hearings for a new candidate at a fraught time for an administration mired in the Russia scandal.

But whether Tillerson leaves now or later, it’s important to look at what lies ahead for the State Department.

It is unclear whether Pompeo can succeed where Tillerson failed. The climate for political appointees in Washington today feels more like that of a lame-duck presidency; many of the old standbys are not interested in signing up for what may turn out to be short-run jobs. That leaves a small pool for Pompeo to fill the State Department’s many unfilled posts. Pompeo's tenure at the Central Intelligence Agency was brief enough that he is unlikely to bring over many loyalists, and most at CIA headquarters in Langley see working for State as a kind of step down anyway (many at the Agency view themselves as jocks to State’s nerds.)

There is also the culture issue. Pompeo’s hard-line stances at the CIA rubbed many officials the wrong way, leaving them wondering if the boss could navigate the nuances that drive good decision making. How poorly that will play out at the State Department, with its culture of discussion and deliberation, its love of what-ifs and maybes, is easy to imagine.

And there's the record: Pompeo caught Trump's eye in part for his tough stance on Iran. Inside the State Department, the Iran nuclear deal is seen as one of the institution's modern-day signature accomplishments. Pompeo is a conservative, and State has always been the most ""liberal,"" as in committed to the global system of trade and democracy part of modern administrations. Tillerson, weakly, but in line with State-think, pushed for some sort of talks with North Korea and supported the Iran deal. Pompeo opposes both.

But whether Tillerson is replaced by Pompeo, who brings specific issues with him, or by someone else, the basics of a transition remain the same. State is a hybrid institution, half foreign and half domestic. The unique interplay between the civil service (non-diplomats, including support staff stationed in Washington DC) and the Foreign Service (who have primary responsibility for policy in Washington and who staff the embassies and consulates abroad) complicates secretary of state transitions. Engaging both workforces, with their different vested interests, can be tough. And unlike the military, where chains of command and internal procedures are written on checklists, State has a more fluid structure. It is a vertically-oriented bureaucracy, with layers below the boss’ office waiting for bits of policy to fall so as to inform them of what their own opinions are.

A huge part of Tillerson's failure was in missing that last point. The traditional way of engaging the bureaucracy is for a new secretary to fill key positions with political appointees, who will shape the rank and file below them. Tillerson left too many slots vacant too long, and now finds himself without allies inside Foggy Bottom. Meanwhile, left on their own, his diplomats found ways to make trouble, including disclosing once-sacrosanct internal “dissent memos” on matters such as the administration’s approach to child soldiers and Trump’s executive orders banning travelers from listed Muslim-majority countries.

Alongside building their version of the organization, it is incumbent on new secretaries to aim the State Department at some broad goal. State is an agency without primary agency. Under one administration it focuses on arms control; under another, State tries to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan. More recently, the emphasis has been on ""soft power:"" programs to empower women, the use of social media, promoting democracy, and the growth of LGBTQ rights globally. Tillerson never articulated much of a goal beyond some unfocused thoughts on structural reform that will never again see daylight. Though it is fashionable to label Tillerson as the worst secretary of state of modern times, in reality Tillerson will be remembered as perhaps the most pointless of secretaries.

Based on my conversations with former State Department colleagues (I served 24 years as a diplomat) Tillerson's successor will encounter a mood inside the State Department reminiscent of a rescue dog kennel: over there are the mutts who feel abused, wary of any new human. Off to the side are the ones who have given up; still on the books to log the service needed to get their generous pensions but with little to offer a new boss. The majority will be open and waiting to see what happens. But watch out for a few who feel newly empowered, the ones who think they helped drive a bad secretary out of office. They may still bite.

At the end of the day, the mismatch is not really about who is secretary of state, but who is president. A lot of the anger directed at Tillerson was using him as a stand-in for Trump. The primary driver of foreign policy remains the White House, and the White House appears to have little love for its diplomats. Trump agreed with dramatically cutting the State Department budget, and many believe the number of unfilled positions is a Trump-driven effort to cripple the institution. Trump himself stated on foreign policy no one but him matters and seemed to dismiss diplomacy as part of a solution in North Korea. Trump seems to favor the military and military men as some of his closest advisors (Pompeo graduated from West Point.) One commentator described the State Department as “an institution that the president doesn’t value, respect, or understand.”

Tillerson, an establishment Republican, had within him a bit of divergent thinking from Trump on issues like Iran and North Korea. Pompeo is an old school hawk and a Trump loyalist. If the president's intention is indeed to dismantle the State Department, it is hard to imagine a person better suited to the task than a partisan guy like Pompeo.

The irony will be if in a few months from now some of the people who wanted Tillerson out start wondering if they had not been better off under his leadership.",Commentary: The problem with a post-Tillerson State Department,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-tillerson/commentary-the-problem-with-a-post-tillerson-state-department-idUSKBN1DY2GL

The rupee plunged to as low as 110 per dollar, before recouping some of the losses to stabilise at 108.50 by midday local time (0700 GMT), traders said. The currency weakened to 107 per dollar on Friday from 105.55 at open.

The rupee has mostly traded in a tight range of 104-105 per dollar since December 2015.

The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) withdrawal of its support for the rupee was seen as a devaluation measure as the central bank is the biggest player in the thinly traded local foreign exchange market and controls what is widely considered a managed float system.

“Today there is no intervention from the central bank and it seems it has been left up to the market to determine the rate today,” said Fawad Khan, Head of Research at BMA Capital.

“It’s kind of a policy stance by the central bank continuing from Friday to let the market determine.”

Economists and businesses have been urging the government to devalue the rupee, saying it was hurting exports and contributing to the depletion of Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves.

The central bank said in a statement after the market closed on Friday that a weaker rupee would help the economy grow and ease balance of payments pressures, comments that market participants interpreted as SBP’s approval of a weaker rupee.

“As per Friday’s statement by the central bank and today’s fluctuation of rupee, it looks like they will maintain the rate around 107-108 in the short term,” said Saad Hashemy, director of research for Topline Securities.",Pakistani rupee weakens further after SBP pulls support,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-rupee/pakistani-rupee-weakens-further-after-sbp-pulls-support-idINKBN1E50Y6

JPMorgan Economist David Hensley suspects the Fed will revise up its growth forecast while trimming the outlook for the unemployment rate, potentially adding upside risk to the “dot plot” forecasts on interest rates.

“The dot plot previously called for three hikes in 2018; it is a close call whether this moves to four hikes,” he warned, a shift that would likely boost the dollar but could bludgeon bonds.

“For its part, the European Central Bank (ECB)is likely to emphasize its low-for-long stance and continue to distance itself from the Fed,” he added. “The staff is likely to revise up its 2018 growth forecast, while we think the core inflation forecast will reveal an even slower recovery than before.”

RATES NOT EVERYTHING

The divergence in Fed and ECB policy was supposed to be bullish for the dollar, given it had widened the premium offered by U.S. two-year yields US2YT=RR over German yields DE2YT=RR to 256 basis points from 188 basis points this time last year.

It may take U.S. regulators a bit longer to warm to the idea of a proliferation of products and securities related to digital currencies, but Cboe Chief Executive Ed Tilly said this weekend’s debut should support progress toward that.

“We will be building confidence in the coming months, and stay tuned, there are more to come,” he said. Chicago-based Cboe operates markets in options, futures, equities and currencies.

The most-active contract exhibited the volatility that has become bitcoin’s hallmark, surging 20 percent at one point to trigger a five-minute trading halt.

“We saw pretty volatile overnight markets, a lot of price moves, but everything worked as it should,” Tilly said.

Cboe was the first U.S.-based, traditional exchange to offer bitcoin futures, and its widely anticipated launch on Sunday evening was seen as a litmus test for more mainstream adoption of the digital asset.

By early afternoon on Monday, nearly 3,700 contracts <0#XBT> had traded hands, with nearly 20 trading firms participating. Most of the activity was concentrated in the January, or front-month, contract XBTF8.

“Just about all of the participants who had shown us readiness late last week and even into this weekend, showed up,” Tilly said.

On the heels of the launch, three fund managers, REX Shares LLC, Van Eck Associates Corp and First Trust Advisors LP, went back to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking permission to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

The SEC has denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals so far, but proponents think a successful debut of futures could breathe new life into the plans.

Cboe plans to wait until there have been a couple of settlements on the one-month futures contracts before it moves forward with any new crypto-derivative products, said Tilly.

Those could include options on futures contracts and on ETFs, Tilly said.

Cboe has also appealed a ruling by the SEC that blocked a Cboe-listed bitcoin ETF proposed by the Gemini bitcoin exchange, which Cboe uses for the final settlement price of its bitcoin futures contracts.

Bitcoin is the largest of the hundreds of crypto-currencies that have flooded the over-the-counter market in recent years, and as demand for other digital coins rises, futures on those coins will follow, Tilly said.

“I do see other currencies going forward.”

LET‘S DO IT AGAIN!

Bitcoin has almost tripled in value in the past month and is up around 15-fold this year. That volatility had some worried about how Cboe’s bitcoin futures would trade.

Just after the opening tick of $15,000 at 6 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, the price of the contract surged 10 percent higher. Cboe had the option of halting trading at that point, but allowed it to continue because trading was orderly, Tilly said.

Following another 10 percent climb, Cboe halted trading in the futures contract for five minutes.

“Markets came back in line and we reopened in an orderly fashion,” said Tilly. “We could not have been more pleased with the way that played out last night.”

Also around the time trading started, Cboe’s website, which is not connected to the company’s trading engine, briefly went down. Tilly said the outage was the result of traffic that was around six times more than the site receives on an average weekday.

Never has a new product launch at Cboe exceeded the level of interest and anticipation around bitcoin futures, he said.

“It’s just been so exciting for us to bring this to market. I told the team last night, I said, ‘let’s do this every Sunday! This is a ton of fun.'”",'More to come' after bitcoin futures launch: Cboe CEO,https://www.reuters.com/article/bitcoin-futures-cboe/more-to-come-after-bitcoin-futures-launch-cboe-ceo-idINKBN1E52JF

Nos últimos dois anos, mais de uma dezena de mulheres acusou Trump de realizar avanços sexuais não desejados antes de ele entrar na política.

Três de suas acusadoras, Jessica Leeds, Rachel Crooks e Samantha Holvey, afirmaram em entrevista coletiva nesta segunda-feira que as acusações justificavam nova consideração dada a discussão mais ampla sobre assédio sexual na sociedade norte-americana.

A Brave New Films, produtora de filmes sem fins lucrativos, produziu um vídeo com 16 das acusadoras de Trump e organizou a coletiva de imprensa em Nova York na segunda-feira. No filme, as mulheres acusam Trump de beijá-las sem sua permissão, agarrá-las por suas partes íntimas, colocar as mãos dentro de suas saias ou de fazer outros avanços não desejados.

O Congresso deve “colocar de lado suas afiliações partidárias e investigar o histórico de má conduta sexual do sr. Trump”, disse Crooks, ex-recepcionista de empresa imobiliária, que foi apoiada por Leeds e Holvey.

As mulheres disseram não acreditar que Trump deixará seu cargo por conta das alegações, mas que ele deve ser responsabilizado.

Trump e autoridades da Casa Branca negaram as alegações, algumas das quais datam de 1980.

“Essas falsas afirmações, totalmente contestadas na maioria dos casos por relatos de testemunhas oculares, foram amplamente abordadas na campanha do ano passado e o povo americano expressou seu julgamento ao entregar uma vitória decisiva”, disse um porta-voz da Casa Branca em comunicado divulgado nesta segunda-feira, questionando o momento da solicitação e as motivações políticas das mulheres.

Trump enfrenta ação judicial em um dos casos relacionados.

Diversos homens de poder e alto escalão têm sido acusados nos últimos meses de conduta sexual inadequada, incluindo três membros do Congresso, o produtor de Hollywood Harvey Weinstein e o ex-âncora da NBC Matt Lauer.

A Reuters não verificou de maneira independente as acusações contra Trump, Weinstein, Lauer ou os três parlamentares.

His interim replacement will be self-described ""right-wing nutjob"" Mick Mulvaney.

Currently the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget Director, Mulvaney is a longtime politician who has tirelessly worked to dismantle regulations and, as CBS News notes, “a longtime critic of the agency.” Nominating Mulvaney, in other words, is functionally equivalent to eliminating the agency entirely.

This ominous sign is the latest example of the Trump administration’s determination to dismantle critical regulations of big business. And it illustrates how the executive branch now unilaterally makes public policy. Trump and a Republican Congress haven’t yet passed major legislation, but they can achieve a lot of policy objectives without doing so.

One of the most important components of the flawed but valuable Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was the creation of the CFPB. The bureau is empowered to regulate financial products and services to prevent the exploitation of consumers. What Trump, congressional Republicans, and the financial sector hated about Cordray is that he did his job. According to Ranae Merle of the Washington Post, “Republicans had become increasingly exasperated that Cordray… continued to press for aggressive rules disliked by the business community. Trump has on at least two occasions griped about Cordray in private and wondered what to do about his tenure.” When Trump said he would “drain the swamp,” he apparently meant that he would clear out anything that would impede Wall Street from exploiting consumers.

Wall Street and Republicans have tried to stymie the CFPB from the beginning. The lesson Republicans took from the disastrous 2008 financial collapse that was created in part by banks taking advantage of customers was that everything was just fine. Senate Republicans were determined not to let Obama nominate anyone to head the agency, and carried out a lengthy filibuster against Cordray, forcing Obama to install him as a temporary recess appointment. (Cordray was later confirmed for a full term.) They haven’t changed at all, and the idea that Trump would orient the party in a more anti-Wall Street direction has been revealed as the ludicrous fantasy it always was.

Congress acting against CPFB regulations may have been the reason Cordray was frustrated enough to leave early. Last month, with Vice-President Mike Pence casting the deciding Senate vote, Congress killed a new rule that protected the ability of consumers to file class action lawsuits against banks, rather than being forced into arbitration that generally tilts toward the interests of the corporation rather than the customer.

Still, because Senate Republicans don’t have the votes to break a Democratic filibuster and overturn or rewrite Dodd-Frank, there’s a limit to what Congress can do to eviscerate the CFPB. And that’s where Trump’s appointments come in. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now being headed by former Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton, who is universally expected to treat his former employers much more kindly than his predecessor, Mary Jo White. In February, Trump’s Department of Labor stopped a rule that would have required financial advisors to act the fiduciary interest of their clients.

This illustrates a real dilemma for the Democratic Party. Without repealing any statutes, Republicans can severely undermine public interest regulation. Both parties, but especially the GOP, have in recent years begun to use every legal lever at their disposal to enact their will, violating past political norms. Instead of nominating a permanent appointee to run CFPB, which would require a Senate vote, Trump has put an acting director – who will keep running OMB – to dismantle the agency without even needing Senate approval. These days, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headed by a Republican appointee is likely to ignore corporate malfeasance and act to undo any strong rules put into place.

This problem is hardly confined to one area of governance. Scott Pruitt’s Environmental Protection Agency is busily acting to dismantle major environmental regulations. The Voting Rights Act is toothless with Jeff Sessions, seen by civil rights activists as a staunch supporter of vote suppression, as Attorney General. And this is the problem with trying to regulate in the interests of ordinary people while one of America’s major political parties is staunchly opposed to such efforts. The Democratic Party can’t protect the public merely by passing laws establishing regulatory agencies: when a Democrat isn’t in the White House, Republican presidents can seriously damage enforcement even if they can’t get legislation repealed. Elections tend to focus on what new laws can be passed, but there needs to be more focus on how existing laws are implemented.",Commentary: How Trump is making it easier to exploit consumers,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-consumer-commentary/commentary-how-trump-is-making-it-easier-to-exploit-consumers-idUSKBN1DG35S
