The pair have been together for a year and a half, and in the time, they’ve never shied away from partaking in a little PDA. In September, the prince, 33, and the actress, 36, attended the Invictus Games, where they held hands throughout the events and even kissed at one point.

The couple displayed the same closeness recently: On Monday, there was their hand-holding-heavy engagement announcement. Then on Friday, they made their first official public appearance in Nottingham, England, for World AIDS Day. Throughout the busy week, the pair linked arms and rubbed each other’s backs ― behavior you almost never see from the prince’s elder brother, Prince William, and his wife, the former Kate Middleton. “As a royal couple, you can see how Meghan and Prince Harry’s outgoing personalities, modern outlook and big hearts will be on display when they meet the public,” said Myka Meier, a royal etiquette expert and the founder and director of Beaumont Etiquette.

Of course, there’s no official protocol that says royals can’t show public displays of affection while attending official engagements. But overall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge seem to prefer a more reined-in approach than Prince Harry and Markle. “It is actually simply is a matter of preference for each couple,” Meier told HuffPost. “Every royal is clearly trusted to make their own judgment calls to what they think is appropriate.”

The difference in style may be most notable in the brothers’ post-engagement interviews. In Markle and Prince Harry’s interview with the BBC last week, the former “Suits” actress cradled her soon-to-be husband’s hand while fielding questions about how he popped the question and if they’ll have children.

When Prince William announced his engagement to Middleton, his college sweetheart, in 2010, the couple relayed all the romantic details of their proposal to the BBC with their hands placed firmly in their own laps. (It’s worth noting that the couple had been dating for eight years by the time Prince William popped the question. By comparison, Prince Harry’s courtship is a bit of a whirlwind.)

Body language expert Traci Brown says the love between the couples is noticeable in both interviews, even if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are less prone to making a show of it. “We see two really different emotion levels with these two interviews,” she said. “Harry and Meghan are attached at the hip and totally OK showing affection. With William and Kate, there’s tenderness and love, but they clearly don’t think it’s OK to show real magnetism.” Meier noted that nowadays, we mostly see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on official duties. A somber commemoration of a World War I battle or a diplomatic visit to another country requires a bit more decorum than dishing on your proposal details.

“The nature of the majority of events they attend are very formal,” Meier said. “At sporting events and more lighthearted events for instance, as a couple they are very warm and more likely to show affection.” Case in point? This photo of the royal couple getting relatively handsy at a marathon training event for charity earlier this year:

William’s reserved ways may also have something to do with his place in the royal line of succession ― he’s the second heir to the British throne, after his father, Prince Charles. “One day, he’ll be the King of England, and the Duke of Cambridge is clearly very sensitive to the honor he has been given,” Meier said. “His actions are a sign that he takes his role as a high ranking royal very seriously, which is simply a sign of respect to both the royal family, his country and its citizens.”

And while there may not be an official rule on hand-holding, there’s certainly precedent for keeping it as proper as possible. The current reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and her husband, Prince Philip, aren’t known for showing overt affection in public, even though they’ve shared 70 years of love and marriage.

Prince Harry, meanwhile, is currently sixth in line for the crown, which may be why he’s garnered a reputation as the more relaxed royal. As for his relatively PDA-heavy courtship, it’s possible that his fiancée’s American ways may be rubbing off on him, Brown said. “Americans are generally much more outgoing and are OK with showing emotions and are into doing their own thing,” she said. “Brits are known to be a little more stuffy, though Harry bucks the trend. Marrying an American seems like a perfect match.”

ANDY STENNING/Getty Images The pair, set to marry in the spring, made their first royal visit as a couple earlier this month.

With both brothers, Meier sees the influence of their late mother, Princess Diana. Before her death in 1997, the Princess of Wales was beloved by the public for her warmth and candor in discussing her private struggles, including her divorce and body image issues. With Prince Harry’s displays of affection and Prince William’s openness to talking about mental health issues, we may very well be seeing a new era of approachability with the royals. “Princes William and Harry are so open with the public ― it shows that they were raised that way,” Meier said. “More than ever, we are seeing a side of the royal family that is so lovable and open and I think that makes them the perfect royal family representatives to lead future generations.”

Our documentary Net at Risk was perhaps the first on television to alert the nation to the danger of a corporate takeover of the internet. When the mainstream media largely ignored the story, we gave advocates for net neutrality a national hearing. We followed former FCC commissioner Michael Copps and others to unofficial town meetings when the George W. Bush FCC refused to sanction such events. And we celebrated in the public interest when the Obama FCC voted in 2015 to protect and enforce net neutrality.

But every time we think the battle to protect the internet is won, the forces of greed, power and control come right back at us. After he and the Republicans won the 2016 election, Donald Trump appointed Ajit Pai, a former executive from Verizon, to head the FCC. Pai is leading the corporate crusade to overturn net neutrality, doing his best to give Verizon and the other telecommunications giants exactly what they want. It’s classic regulatory capture, a government agency capitulating to the very industry it’s supposed to oversee, the old fox in the henhouse switch that means death to the chickens.

********

To understand why the internet’s in big trouble again, first know this about how Washington works these days:

Donald Trump seems to irradiate and poison everyone who is sucked into his gravitational pull. There’s a black hole in residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

Attorneys engaged in his defense twist themselves into questionable statements and behaviors as special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe draws nearer. Members of Congress surrender their self-esteem and whatever shred of decency they may have left to put forward the plutocrats’ agenda, while pandering to Trump’s hardcore followers for fear of losing campaign donations or being primaried. Administration officials who are established enough to know better bow in obeisance or vigorously nod their heads in agreement with any dingbat thing the president says.

Mysteriously, some actually appear to enjoy the Kool-Aid; for all the buffoonery, Trump’s cave-bear philosophy, such as it is, tends to favor the ideological and theocratic inclinations of people like Vice President Pence and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Others are more manipulative and cynical, using this special moment in American history to hold their noses, take advantage and use the clown show as cover to advance the wish list that corporate America has been mailing to Santa for decades.

In that latter category, place the ambitious current chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai. He was appointed a member of the FCC in 2011, and then named by Trump to take the chair earlier this year. Ever since, Pai has reshaped the commission as a pass-through for the telecommunications giants, giving them virtually everything they want. Acting more like the associate general counsel of Verizon that he once was and less like the government regulator he’s supposed to be, Pai quickly began doing his utmost to wipe out whatever rules remain that keep open to citizens the lines of communication essential to a democracy.

Right now, his sights are aimed at net neutrality, the set of protections approved by the FCC in 2015 that keep the big internet service providers (ISPs) like Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Charter from completely taking over and deciding who can see what on the web, how fast and for how much.

Why is this important? In a recent interview, Annenberg School Professor Victor Pickard says that net neutrality “speaks to a core social contract between government, corporations and the public… how can members of the public obtain information and services, and express ourselves creatively and politically, without interference from massive corporations?”

That’s the nub of it. Ending net neutrality will squelch competition, innovation and small internet startups, and limit freedom of expression, independent voices and diverse viewpoints. More than ever, Big Business, like Big Brother, will control what you read, see and hear and limit your own ability to speak up and share your opinions, your creativity, your life.

A commission vote has been set for Thursday, Dec. 14, and despite vast and continuing public opposition, the three Republican commissioners, including Pai, seem determined to overrule the two Democrats and once again give the big guys what they want.

In his obdurate denial of the desires of the public (both on the right and left, by the way) Pai embraces certain of the more delightful aspects of Trumpism: doublespeak, belittling the other side, blaming everyone else for problems and claiming fake news when presented with the facts. In a recent speech defending his position, sponsored by the conservative, free-market think tank R Street Institute and the Lincoln Network, Pai described what he called “wild accusations, fear-mongering and hysteria” and made fun of such celebrities as Cher, Mark Ruffalo and George Takei who have spoken out in support of net neutrality.

What’s more, he claimed it wasn’t the ISPs that were trying to take over the web, but that content providers Google, Facebook and Twitter were the real culprits: “They might cloak their advocacy in the public interest, but the real interest of these internet giants is in using the regulatory process to cement their dominance in the internet economy.”

Chairman Pai, this is called projection. You claim to be preserving internet freedom but in truth your attempt to destroy net neutrality does just the opposite. In pushing your case you’re ignoring the people, the facts and the law.

A poll taken in July by Freedman Consulting reported: “Americans of all political parties overwhelmingly support the values of net neutrality and want to preserve existing net neutrality protections. A strong majority (77 percent) of Americans support keeping the existing net neutrality rules in place. This view crosses party lines, as 73 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Independents want to keep the FCC’s Open Internet rules.”

Millions of comments in support of net neutrality have been left on the FCC website, and in the first 24 hours after Pai released his draft of the net neutrality proposal (just before Thanksgiving), more than 200,000 phone calls were made to Congress. As of a week ago Sunday that number had reached 750,000. On Thursday, Dec. 7, 700 protests across all 50 states were held outside Verizon stores and other locations.

What’s more, Chairman Pai, contrary to your claims that net neutrality has squelched the growth of investment in the internet, there has been a 5-percent increase since the rules were put into effect.

In fact, Tom Rutledge, CEO of Charter Communications, the second-largest cable company in the United States, told investors in 2016 that net neutrality “didn’t really hurt us; it hasn’t hurt us.”

Finally, Chairman Pai, you and the telecommunications monoliths claim that Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, the law cited to classify ISPs as utilities (like telephones and electricity) and allow net neutrality rules, is out-of-date and irrelevant.

On the contrary, says Danny Kimball, who teaches communications and media studies at Goucher College. In The Washington Post, he wrote that Title II makes it possible “for the public to access information and communication on an equal basis… it’s about basic principles of openness and nondiscrimination, no matter the technology used to communicate.”

Title II is precisely the law under which the courts have ruled that the net neutrality rules are valid. And as Tim Wu, originator of the phrase “net neutrality” says, “A mere change in FCC ideology isn’t enough” to change that.

So on Thursday the FCC may vote to overturn net neutrality, but that decision will go straight to the courts. Boing Boing’s Cory Doctorow points out that “it stands a good chance of being struck down — and in any event, the court battle may last until 2020 and serve as a good argument to spur voters to vote against Trump and thus change the FCC leadership, mooting the whole point.”

Meanwhile, Chairman Pai makes jokes at a Washington dinner about Verizon having groomed him as a Manchurian Candidate to take over the FCC. He keeps promising a “light-touch regulatory framework,” and the ISPs pinky swear that if net neutrality is revoked they won’t ever, ever do anything bad: no blocking, no throttling, no fast and slow lanes, no preferential treatment, no overcharging. Any potential danger, they claim is merely theoretical, not real.

But now there’s a new battle brewing. It seems that each of the LinkNYC kiosks has front-facing cameras.

The skirmish over the cameras may have been going on for some time, and it’s unclear how widespread the action is, or if there is an organization behind disabling the cameras.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is reporting that LinkNYC “Improves Privacy Policy, Yet Problems Remain” in a post on their website. They say, in part: “In the wake of its 2017 policy changes, LinkNYC still collects what it describes as “Technical Information,” including information such as IP addresses, anonymized MAC addresses, device type, device identifiers, and more, for up to 60 days. Additionally, the LinkNYC kiosks have cameras that store footage for up to 7 days.”

And the NYCLU has been engaging Mayor DeBlasio on the matter as well - saying in a letter: “the NYCLU remains concerned about the vast amount of private information retained by the LinkNYC system and the lack of robust language in the privacy policy protecting users against unwarranted government surveillance.”

And goes on to say: “The NYCLU seeks clarification on CityBridge’s policy regarding sharing of data collected by the environmental sensors and cameras on the Links. The policy states that “[CityBridge] will not give any data collected by environmental sensors or cameras to anyone other than the City or governmental law enforcement,” with a few exceptions. One of those exceptions is with “advanced, written permission from the City.” We would like to know whether the environmental sensors and cameras will be routinely feeding into any City or NYPD systems, including the Domain Awareness System; if so, that should be made explicit in the privacy policy.”

We’ve reached out to LinkNYC and EFF to get any additional details about the LinkNYC cameras and the ongoing blockage campaign.

Updated (2) : EFF responded with this statement:

“EFF is not familiar with the campaign to cover the cameras on LinkNYC kiosks with post-it notes, but it should come as no surprise” said EFF Director of Grassroots Advocacy Shahid Buttar. “As we have noted before, the LinkNYC system lacks any opportunity for public participation in the policymaking process, as well as remedies for potential violations of its privacy policy or inevitable data breaches. The activation of the kiosks’ cameras reflect both of those problems, making them a predictable target for street artists.”

Until recently, I was one of the hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers who help bring you the holidays when you shop online.

Working at an Amazon fulfillment center, I took pride in my work behind the scenes to make shopping easier for you. But the reality is, we work hard and yet the holidays aren’t delivering for Amazon temp workers like me.

Last fall, Amazon announced a nationwide hiring spree of warehouse workers, promising decent wages and health benefits. The company fills many of its warehouse positions through temp and staffing agencies. That way, they don’t have to offer the same pay and benefits they offer to Amazon employees. As Amazon proudly tells its investors, “we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce.”

I came on last November to work in package-receiving at an Amazon warehouse in Joliet, Illinois. But I was hired by Integrity Staffing Solutions, a temp agency that’s been one of Amazon’s partners since 1998. Integrity Staffing lists dozens of temp jobs on its website, claiming “these are no ordinary jobs. They can be the next rung up your ladder of career and personal success.” But that was hardly my experience as a temp worker at Amazon.

Working for the temp agency, I was treated differently than the people who did the same job, but worked directly for Amazon. I had no benefits, but they did. I made $12.50 an hour, but they made $13.00. And if I was late coming back from a break, I got in trouble, even if Amazon’s direct employees were walking right next to me.

It’s unfair that companies like Amazon can use these kinds of staffing arrangements to avoid responsibility for their workers. Although on paper I worked for a temp agency, who I really worked for was Amazon. After all, I was working at an Amazon warehouse, moving Amazon orders, and being supervised by Amazon employees, with key terms of employment largely determined by Amazon. That’s why I say Amazon was my real boss.

I have a family of six kids and a fiancée, so a lot of people are depending on me, and it was really hard to get by on such low pay, with no benefits.

When I was hired, I was promised a full-time job working directly for Amazon. Instead, I was laid off in June. The staffing company told me I’d hit a 1,500-hour limit the company set up. I’d have to come back in 90 days.

After I waited three months, the temp agency called me in and said I had to wait another 90 days before I could try again for a job with Amazon. When I finally got a call-back in October, I was told Amazon would now call me their employee. I gladly went back to work, but was laid off again after just a couple of months. This time, they told me my job was just a seasonal one.

This kind of treatment just isn’t fair to workers like me.

It used to be that if you were hired by a Fortune 500 company, you thought you had it made, and you’d be getting decent pay, benefits, and long-term employment if you worked hard. For many Amazon warehouse workers like me, it now means short-term, badly-paid work with no benefits, being laid off all the time, and having the company pretend it isn’t even your boss.

They call this “outsourcing” and say it makes their business more efficient. I call it squeezing the workers at the bottom of the chain. Hiding behind temp agencies and subcontractors, companies like Amazon cheat workers of fair pay, workplace benefits, and the right to negotiate over wages and working conditions with our real employer.

Amazon has really changed how people buy almost everything, especially at this time of year. But working for it isn’t any better than working for Walmart, especially for workers like me who the company insists aren’t its employees.",Amazon Temp Workers Who Deliver The Holidays Are Getting Squeezed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-temp-workers-who-deliver-the-holidays-are-getting-squeezed_us_5a2f0a20e4b078950282f6e4?section=us_business

AHMEDABAD, Gujarat — The first time I spoke with Hanif Lakdawala, about a month ago, the 67-year-old Gujarati doctor sounded calm, but his frustration over the treatment of Muslims in the run-up to assembly polls in the state was palpable even on the phone.

When I met him in Ahmedabad on Friday, a day ahead of the Assembly Elections, much of the calm had worn off and the public health activist, in soft tones, chastised Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Shailesh Mehta who recently said that he would ensure that the town of Dabhoi would not turn into Dubai if he was elected a lawmaker.

The openly-communal comment about Dubai alludes to what some BJP leaders have said during rallies about capping the Muslim population that many Hindus see as a threat to their community.

""For the majority of people in Gujarat, hatred for Muslims has become part of their consciousness. They are born with hatred for Muslims,"" the doctor said.

Not only has Lakdawala worked to improve public health in urban slums for four decades, he is famous for rehabilitation work in the aftermath of the 2002 communal riots that displaced tens of thousands of Muslims. The four decades that he has spent in the field have also made a him the go-to guy for journalists and politicians. Every election, his office is crowded with reporters picking his brain about the Muslim community, while party workers seek his help in reaching out to the community.

I had returned for a conversation with Lakdawala, driven by curiosity about whether he had made up his mind about voting for the Congress which had gone through its campaigning for Gujarat elections without uttering the ""M"" word, taking the Muslim vote for granted and publicizing its Hindu credentials.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi looks at his mobile phone at rally in Dahegam, some 40km from Ahmedabad, on November 25, 2017.

After witnessing Rahul Gandhi's temple-visiting spree, without a single visit to a Muslim neighbourhood, let alone a dargah or mosque, would the NOTA (none of the above) button on electronic voting machines end up being a viable choice for Lakdawala?

The doctor minced no words to relay his unhappiness.

""What Muslim vote? Does Muslim life even matter in India,"" he said, registering his horror at the hacking and burning alive of a Muslim man by a Hindu who suspected that he was involved with a Hindu woman.

The doctor then recalled the deaths of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan in Alwar and sixteen-year-old Junaid in a Haryana-bound train. ""I don't think Muslim life matters,"" he concluded.

""This is an Assembly election. AAP has no chances here. The most important thing is for us to defeat the BJP and only Congress can defeat the BJP"".

The furrows on his forehead deepened as he told me that he had always voted for the Congress Party, with the exception of the 2014 Assembly election when he chose the Aam Aadmi Party candidate because he was ""honest.""

""This is an Assembly election. AAP has no chances here. The most important thing is for us to defeat the BJP and only Congress can defeat the BJP,"" he said. ""We don't have a choice. We just don't have a choice.""

Universal Adult Franchise

In Gujarat, Muslims, who make up nine percent of the population, have been politically sidelined especially after the BJP came to power in 1995.

From 12 lawmakers in 1980, the number of Muslims in the state legislature has been steadily declining. In 2002, three Muslims were elected as lawmakers, five in 2007 and two in 2012. In 2017, the Congress has fielded six Muslims candidates, while the BJP does not have any.

In this election, the Muslims are calling themselves the ""taken-for-granted community"" because the Congress believes them to have no choice.

There is a contradiction when it comes to what the Congress is preaching and practicing.

At the national level, the Congress is pushing a secularism versus fundamentalism narrative, but the party's campaign in Gujarat has been a reaction to the BJP's narrative that one needs only the Hindus to win.

""Congress is soft Hindutva that we know. Even in 2002, there were some Congress people who were involved in looting and burning. The only difference is that Congress being a conglomeration of people with different ideologies we always have some people whom we can go and talk. In BJP, if you ask me today, I don't know any BJP fellow who I can go and talk. They are not reaching out to the Muslim community,"" said Lakdawala.

There is no doubt that the Congress, led by a more confident Rahul Gandhi, has rattled the BJP in its own bastion. Some analysts believe this to be neck-and-neck contest.

On the one hand, the Congress has focused on the Patels, successfully tapping into the anger that demonetisation has unleashed among the trader community. On the other hand, the Grand Old Party has steered clear of the Muslims, doing and saying nothing that could be interpreted as appeasing the minority.

Many Congress leaders say that the party's policy is only a means to an end because there is no other way of beating the BJP in a polarised state like Gujarat.

Others believe it to be setting the trend for future state elections and the national election. The Congress' strategy going forward would be to exploit anger against the the Modi government, focusing on issues like the economy, unemployment, caste atrocities and farmer distress.

In the battle of Gujarat, the Muslims have been made to feel entirely irrelevant and that is extremely dangerous. In a democracy, where people express themselves by voting, rendering impotent a community's Universal Adult Franchise is a sure shot way of radicalizing it.

In Gujarat, Lakdawala said, ""Universal adult franchise does not mean anything for Muslims. Our vote does not matter.""

1985....2002....2017

Unlike the majority of Muslims in Ahmedabad who live in ""ghettos"" populated with other Muslims, Lakdawala and his family has always lived in localities with mostly Hindus. But he can recall the exact moment that he first became conscious of being a Muslim. The year was 1985 and he was a 35-year-old medical practitioner in Ahmedabad.

""I was coming out of my home in a Hindu locality. My neighbor came and told me 'don't go out today'. I said why, the communal violence was at least eight to ten kilometers away. I said it is far away. But he said 'everyone knows that you are Muslim and there is a danger.' That is the first time I realized that I was Muslim and people thought that I was a different person and there is threat to me even if the communal violence is far away,"" Lakdawala said.

""That was the first time I realized that nothing else matters, my qualifications, my work, nothing matters in this society. In Gujarat, it is only religion. And slowly that identity of being Muslim was reinforced by various factors. We could not rent a house. Even in 1985, it was with difficulty that we could find a house but when we tried to shift to other localities, no one was ready to give us (accommodation). They flatly refused. It was only through a friend who was willing to give us a house and it was because there was a South Indian community living there that we got,"" the doctor told me.

This is where it all started seven years ago coach S6 of the Sabarmati Express, which was torched at Signal Falia near Godhra railway station on February 27, 2002

When riots broke out in 2002, Lakdawala and his family sought refuge with their Hindu friends, moving from house to house. ""We would move after a day or two so as not to burden any one family,"" he said. ""The 2002 riots were bad. It was horrible.""

""We would move after a day or two so as not to burden any one family.""

The riots broke out after 59 Hindus activists, on their way back to Gujarat from the site of the demolished Babri masjid in Ayodhya on a train, were burnt to death by a suspected Muslim mob in February 2002. It triggered one of the country's worst religious pogroms that resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, in retaliatory violence.

If those episodes of religious violence made Lakdawala scared for his physical safety, the 2017 Assembly election have made him feel invisible.

While refusing to acknowledge the Muslims of Gujarat during its campaign, the Congress is now engaged in damage control by discreetly reaching out to the community. The party has deployed Muslim leaders from outside the state to reassure members from the community that they have not been forgotten.

Lakdawala, who was recently approached by one such Muslim leader, is appalled at the need to maintain secrecy.

""It is very humiliating. It is very humiliating for Muslims,"" he said.

""Congress would at least go to Muslims to get votes when there were elections, not secretly ask us to spread the word. Even though many Muslims will be happy to play a role in defeating BJP, there is no denying that is very hurtful,"" he said.

But as more and more people are watching the series, controversy has surfaced surrounding its sensitive subject matter.

“13 Reasons Why,” based on the best-selling book by Jay Asher, follows the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), who takes her own life after facing numerous traumatic experiences in high school. She records 13 tapes to give to the individuals she says played some sort of role in her decision, leaving her friend Clay (Dylan Minnette) to uncover the harsh reality behind her heartbreaking death.

Due to the fact that the show is being binge-watched by the youngest generations, many, including experts in the field of suicide and assault, are worried that the graphic content of Brian Yorkey’s series is simply too much.

Now, executive producer Selena Gomez is speaking out about her decision to join the project and put it out into the world. During an interview with E!

“I believed in the project for so long and I understood what the message was,” she said. “I just wanted it to come across in a way that kids would be frightened, but confused ― in a way that they would talk about it because it’s something that’s happening all the time.

Think you can spot an introvert in a crowd? Think again. Although the stereotypical introvert may be the one at the party who’s hanging out alone by the food table fiddling with an iPhone, the “social butterfly” can just as easily have an introverted personality. “Spotting the introvert can be harder than finding Waldo,” Sophia Dembling, author of The Introvert’s Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World, told HuffPost. “A lot of introverts can pass as extroverts.” People are frequently unaware that they’re introverts ― especially if they’re not shy ― because they may not realize that being an introvert is about more than just cultivating time alone. Instead, it can be more instructive to pay attention to whether they’re losing or gaining energy from being around others, even if the company of friends gives them pleasure. “Introversion is a basic temperament, so the social aspect — which is what people focus on — is really a small part of being an introvert,” Marti Olsen Laney, psychotherapist and author of The Introvert Advantage, said in a Mensa discussion. “It affects everything in your life.” Despite the growing conversation around introversion, it remains a frequently misunderstood personality trait. As recently as 2010, the American Psychiatric Association even considered classifying “introverted personality” as a disorder by listing it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), a manual used to diagnose mental illness. But more and more introverts are speaking out about what it really means to be a “quiet type.” Not sure if you’re an innie or an outie? See if any of these 23 telltale signs of introversion apply to you. 1. You find small talk incredibly cumbersome.

Introverts are notoriously small talk-phobic, as they find idle chatter to be a source of anxiety, or at least annoyance. For many quiet types, chitchat can feel disingenuous. “Let’s clear one thing up: Introverts do not hate small talk because we dislike people,” Laurie Helgoe writes in Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life Is Your Hidden Strength. “We hate small talk because we hate the barrier it creates between people.” 2. You go to parties -– but not to meet people. If you’re an introvert, you may sometimes enjoy going to parties, but chances are, you’re not going because you’re excited to meet new people. At a party, most introverts would rather spend time with people they already know and feel comfortable around. If you happen to meet a new person that you connect with, great — but meeting people is rarely the goal. 3. You often feel alone in a crowd. Ever feel like an outsider in the middle of social gatherings and group activities, even with people you know? “If you tend to find yourself feeling alone in a crowd, you might be an introvert,” says Dembling. “We might let friends or activities pick us, rather than extending our own invitations.” 4. Networking makes you feel like a phony.

Networking (read: small-talk with the end goal of advancing your career) can feel particularly disingenuous for introverts, who crave authenticity in their interactions. “Networking is stressful if we do it in the ways that are stressful to us,” Dembling says, advising introverts to network in small, intimate groups rather than at large mixers. 5. You’ve been called “too intense.” Do you have a penchant for philosophical conversations and a love of thought-provoking books and movies? If so, you’re a textbook introvert. “Introverts like to jump into the deep end,” says Dembling. 6. You’re easily distracted. While extroverts tend to get bored easily when they don’t have enough to do, introverts have the opposite problem — they get easily distracted and overwhelmed in environments with an excess of stimulation. “Extroverts are commonly found to be more easily bored than introverts on monotonous tasks, probably because they require and thrive on high levels of stimulation,” Clark University researchers wrote in a paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “In contrast, introverts are more easily distracted than extroverts and, hence, prefer relatively unstimulating environments.” 7. Downtime doesn’t feel unproductive to you.

One of the most fundamental characteristics of introverts is that they need time alone to recharge their batteries. Whereas an extrovert might get bored or antsy spending a day at home alone with tea and a stack of magazines, this sort of down time feels necessary and satisfying to an introvert. 8. Giving a talk in front of 500 people is less stressful than having to mingle with those people afterwards. Introverts can be excellent leaders and public speakers — and although they’re stereotyped as being the shrinking violet, they don’t necessarily shy away from the spotlight. Performers like Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera and Emma Watson all identify as introverts, and an estimated 40 percent of CEOs have introverted personalities. Instead, an introvert might struggle more with meeting and greeting large groups of people on an individual basis. 9. When you get on the subway, you sit at the end of the bench -– not in the middle. Whenever possible, introverts tend to avoid being surrounded by people on all sides. “We’re likely to sit in places where we can get away when we’re ready to — easily,” says Dembling. “When I go to the theater, I want the aisle seat or the back seat.” 10. You start to shut down after you’ve been active for too long. Do you start to get tired and unresponsive after you’ve been out and about for too long? It’s likely because you’re trying to conserve energy. Everything introverts do in the outside world causes them to expend energy, after which they’ll need to go back and replenish their stores in a quiet environment, says Dembling. Short of a quiet place to go, many introverts will resort to zoning out. 11. You’re in a relationship with an extrovert.

It’s true that opposites attract, and introverts frequently gravitate towards outgoing extroverts who encourage them to have fun and not take themselves too seriously. “Introverts are sometimes drawn to extroverts because they like being able to ride their ‘fun bubble,’” Dembling says. 12. You’d rather be an expert at one thing than try to do everything. The dominant brain pathways introverts use is one that allows you to focus and think about things for a while, so they’re geared toward intense study and developing expertise, according to Olsen Laney. 13. You actively avoid any shows that might involve audience participation. Because really, is anything more terrifying? 14. You screen all your calls — even from friends.

You may not pick up your phone even from people you like, but you’ll call them back as soon as you’re mentally prepared and have gathered the energy for the conversation. “To me, a ringing phone is like having somebody jump out of a closet and go ‘BOO!’” says Dembling. “I do like having a long, nice phone call with a friend — as long as it’s not jumping out of the sky at me.” 15. You notice details that others don’t. The upside of being overwhelmed by too much stimuli is that introverts often have a keen eye for detail, noticing things that may escape others around them. Research has found that introverts exhibit increased brain activity when processing visual information, as compared to extroverts. 16. You have a constantly running inner monologue. “Extroverts don’t have the same internal talking as we do,” says Olsen Laney. “Most introverts need to think first and talk later.” 17. You have low blood pressure. A 2006 Japanese study found that introverts tend to have lower blood pressure than their extroverted counterparts. 18. You’ve been called an “old soul” -– since your 20s. Introverts observe and take in a lot of information, and they think before they speak, leading them to appear wise to others. “Introverts tend to think hard and be analytical,” says Dembling. “That can make them seem wise.” 19. You don’t feel “high” from your surroundings

Neurochemically speaking, things like huge parties just aren’t your thing. Extroverts and introverts differ significantly in how their brains process experiences through “reward” centers. Researchers demonstrated this phenomenon by giving Ritalin — the ADHD drug that stimulates dopamine production in the brain — to introverted and extroverted college students. They found that extroverts were more likely to associate the feeling of euphoria achieved by the rush of dopamine with the environment they were in. Introverts, by contrast, did not connect the feeling of reward to their surroundings. The study “suggests that introverts have a fundamental difference in how strongly they process rewards from their environment, with the brains of introverts weighing internal cues more strongly than external motivational and reward cues,” explained LiveScience’s Tia Ghose. 20. You look at the big picture. When describing the way that introverts think, Jung explained that they’re more interested in ideas and the big picture rather than facts and details. Of course, many introverts excel in detail-oriented tasks — but they often have a mind for more abstract concepts as well. “Introverts do really enjoy abstract discussion,” says Dembling. 21. You’ve been told to “come out of your shell.” Many introverted children come to believe that there’s something “wrong” with them if they’re naturally less outspoken and assertive than their peers. Introverted adults often say that as children, they were told to come out of their shells or participate more in class. 22. You’re a writer. Introverts are often better at communicating in writing than in person, and many are drawn to the solitary, creative profession of writing. Most introverts — like “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling — say that they feel most creatively charged when they have time to be alone with their thoughts. 23. You alternate between phases of work and solitude, and periods of social activity.

Introverts can move around their introverted “set point” which determines how they need to balance solitude with social activity. But when they move too much — possibly by over-exerting themselves with too much socializing and busyness — they get stressed and need to come back to themselves, according Olsen Laney. This may manifest as going through periods of heightened social activity, and then balancing it out with a period of inwardness and solitude. “There’s a recovery point that seems to be correlated with how much interaction you’ve done,” says Dembling. “We all have our own private cycles.”",23 Signs You're Secretly An Introvert,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/12/08/introvert-signs-am-i-introverted_n_18761160.html?ir=Healthy+Living

After the election, she met with Ivanka Trump― who has marketed herself to be an advocate for women in the White House ― to talk about the work Planned Parenthood does.","WASHINGTON ― Planned Parenthood is more popular than it has ever been in the face of relentless attacks from Congress and state legislatures that constantly remind women of what they have to lose.

Donations to the family planning provider have skyrocketed since the election, a record 75 percent of the public said in a recent poll that the federal government should continue funding Planned Parenthood, and a Fox News poll found that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Planned Parenthood are the two most well-liked political entities in America right now. But Cecile Richards, president of the organization for the last decade, is not in the mood to celebrate.

“I take no joy in our popularity or support when it comes at the expense of women in this country,” she told HuffPost in an interview Thursday. “Planned Parenthood’s popularity is stronger, our membership base is stronger, but that doesn’t make up for the fact that millions of women’s health care is at risk under Donald Trump. His first 100 days have been incredibly painful for women.”

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed a resolution allowing states to withhold Title X family planning funds from Planned Parenthood and other providers because they offer abortion services separately from the grant. The move jeopardizes Planned Parenthood’s ability to subsidize birth control, Pap smears and other preventative health care for about 1.5 million low-income and uninsured patients.

Republicans in Congress are still trying to prevent Medicaid from contracting with Planned Parenthood, which would drive away more than half of its patients. And Trump is determined to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a law that would no longer require insurance companies to cover maternity care or protect people with pre-existing conditions.

Planned Parenthood supporters have fought back by flooding Republican congressmen’s town halls to confront them on health care and share deeply personal stories about the reasons they’ve had to visit the family planning provider.

“It’s absolutely extraordinary,” Richards said. “I have been an organizer my whole life, and I have never seen this kind of outpouring. If there was any silver lining to what’s happened over the last three months, its that women are now participating in politics and I think are either going to change the direction that this administration is going or change who’s in office.”

The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is having a crisis of conscience on abortion. After the party embraced a mayoral candidate in Nebraska who has led anti-abortion initiatives in the state legislature, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez drew a line in the sand on the issue, demanding that all Democratic candidates back a woman’s right to choose. But two high-profile members of the party ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) ― disagreed that there’s no room in the party for anti-abortion Democrats.

Richards, of course, is taking Perez’s side. “I’m not part of the party. I don’t run their business,” she said. “But I think the party should stand for women’s rights, and it has. And I think there’s a real distinction between people having their own personal feelings about all kinds of issues, including abortion, which is a very personal topic certainly for women, and electing people who then want to impose their personal religious views on other people.”

Richards insists that Planned Parenthood would support any candidate “from any party, any walk of life,” who supports women’s access to health care. But she said the difference between Trump and former President Barack Obama, who worked with Planned Parenthood to make birth control essentially free for 50 million women, is “immeasurable.”

“To have an all-time historic low for teen pregnancy is no small deal,” Richards said. “To have a 30-year low for unintended pregnancies, better access to better methods of birth control― that’s huge progress. The reason that all of this is causing such concern among women in America is because it’s clear in this Congress that all of that is at risk.”

Of course, Richards is trying to reach out to the Trump administration. After the election, she met with Ivanka Trump― who has marketed herself to be an advocate for women in the White House ― to talk about the work Planned Parenthood does. She would not elaborate on the details of that conversation, but added she has yet to see a sign from the White House that Ivanka or anyone there is standing up for women’s health.

“I hope that both people in this administration and members of Congress will begin to pay attention to 51 percent of the population of America, who are desperately concerned about their future,” she said. “It is enormously frustrating to have primarily rooms full of men making policy decisions and voting on issues which they will never be impacted directly themselves, and have millions of women in this country who are not being represented.”",Planned Parenthood President: 'I Take No Joy In Our Popularity' Under Trump,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/04/28/planned-parenthood-president-i-take-no-joy-in-our-popularity-under-trump_n_16310102.html

As Miller points out, “Cat Person” resists easy judgments of its characters and instead shows two complex, flawed people.","In scouting the story, before reading it, I’ll admit I thought that all the kerfuffle was because The New Yorker had published a daring genre romance about a shape-shifting cat/person and a human. (I blame the creepily ambiguous image of a kiss attached to the story.) It turns out “Cat Person” fascinated people for something else: the uncomfortable, unflinching realness with which it depicts a murky, troubling sexual encounter between a young woman and a man she recently began dating.

Fiction? No, fiction isn’t on the list of things to go viral. At least until this weekend, when The New Yorker dropped “Cat Person” by Kristen Roupenian on the internet and sauntered away like an action star silhouetted in front of an explosion. What happened? Why did “Cat Person” catch fire while so many other great New Yorker stories have, comparatively, fizzled?

In fact, “Cat Person” specifically tapped into a need that those xoJane personal essays also fulfilled: honest, vulnerable narration of women’s real-life experience. So much about women’s lives and bodies is framed as shameful, embarrassing. We’re taught to hide our periods, fake orgasms and say yes to a date so as not to hurt a guy’s feelings. How liberating it can be to share what we’re hiding with each other and find out that other women aren’t clean, kind, gentle paragons ― they’re complicated, shallow, misguided and sometimes gross, just like us.

The ubiquity of these essays, in a slightly earlier Internet Age, owed a great deal to the economic considerations of web media, as they require no reporting or expertise and yet tap into the reptilian click-and-share node of our brains. Though The New Yorker’s Jia Tolentino bid farewell to the form earlier this year , it will never entirely leave us. We will always be interested in how other people find love, break up, find balls of cat hair in their vaginas. (Sorry, that happened.)

For one thing, it reads quite similarly to another viral-friendly form: the first-person confessional essay, as propagated by outlets like xoJane and Jezebel. Plenty of Twitter readers, rather tellingly, referred to it as an article or an essay, rather than a short story. “Cat Person” unfolds in a sort of transparent prose that’s not demonstratively artful; it’s easy to lose oneself in, and to get wrapped up in Margot’s neuroses and imagined realities, much as one focuses on the psychological revelations in a New York Times Modern Love column rather than the structure or the use of adjectives. Roupenian’s story is the fiction version of “It Happened to Me: I Had Bad Sex Because It Felt Awkward to Say No.”

To people who frequent certain neighborhoods of Twitter (Book Twitter, but also Feminism Twitter and Media Twitter), the story seemed to be everywhere, along with that unsettling image. Nor was its ubiquity an illusion. “Of all the fiction we published this year, ‘Cat Person’ was by far the most-read online,” Natalie Raabe, the magazine’s director of communications, told HuffPost. “It’s also one of our most-read pieces overall for the year.”

The fortuitous timing, by the way, was no accident. “We had [the story] in hand for a few weeks, and yes, the subject is topical,” Treisman said, “so we felt it would be a good time. We didn’t want to hold on to it for months.”

“This particular story doesn’t concern sexual abuse or harassment, it doesn’t concern workplace abuse or rape, but it does take a look at people’s inability to read each other, inability to read each other sexually,” New Yorker fiction editor Deborah Treisman told HuffPost in a phone conversation on Monday.

The story hit at just the right moment ― amid the #MeToo reckoning , as our society has been consumed by questions of sexual discomfort, misconduct and the toxic state of our scripts around male-female interactions.

Roupenian’s story, if you haven’t read it, is about a college student named Margot who starts texting with Robert, a man who frequents the artsy movie theater where she works. Eventually the two go on a date; it goes rather poorly, but she still ends up back at his place. Once there, her sexual desire for him starts to fade, but she decides she’d rather have sex with him than face an awkward and involved conversation about why she doesn’t want to anymore. She has the sex she doesn’t want to have, she leaves and she stops texting with Robert ― who, spoiler alert, does not handle the rejection gracefully.

I don't really know how to do justice to the conversation that is happening around my story but I am grateful for it. I need to go take a walk in the snow and hug my dog, but if you have messaged me directly, thank you, and in the meantime: https://t.co/IjVFkzWGi6

That “Cat Person” dove deep into a young woman’s consciousness, narrating the female side of a messy, disappointing sexual encounter between a man and a woman, struck many readers as refreshing. (That the young woman was a college student, and her experience a familiar one to the predominantly white, well-educated, financially well-off women who likely make up much of The New Yorker’s readership, could only have helped the story strike a nerve among the target audience.) There’s a wealth of short fiction by men, about men’s desultory sexual doings. Then again, there’s also plenty of great short fiction by women, about women having sex and relationships ― Lorrie Moore and Mary Gaitskill are just a couple of classic examples.

But unlike so many other excellent short stories about dating, sex and female interiority, Roupenian’s story ― her first for The New Yorker ― hit at a moment when we were all primed and ready to talk about it. The specific timeliness of the #MeToo moment combined with the other appeals of “Cat Person” to create an alchemical appeal.

“I’m sure [the response] does have something to do with the nature of our discourse right now, about sex, about consent,” said Treisman. “Those kinds of issues are so much in the news and in the air right now that this was a way to look at them, somewhat away from the political sphere, and the sphere of Hollywood producers and so on.”

Though, as she points out, women having these experiences is not new, it can’t be denied that we’re talking about all of those experiences, past and present, with particular avidity now. It’s as if we all signed up for a seminar on women’s bad sexual experiences with men and we’re halfway through the semester; the early foundational reading has been completed, and now we’re all on the same page. That doesn’t mean we all agree ― on the contrary, “Cat Person” Twitter was pretty divided on even questions so basic as whether Robert or Margot deserved more sympathy ― but we all recognize this story as a clear opportunity to talk about consent, communication and women’s sexual pleasure. If the same story came out six months ago, it would have been the same story, but there wouldn’t have been the same shared understanding of its resonance.

Sad as it might be to admit, a big part of the viral success of “Cat Person” might be, simply, that a work of short fiction has never really gone viral on social media before. Early on, the online conversation surrounding it was a meta-conversation: Isn’t it cool that a short story is getting read? Why is this short story getting read? Is everyone so excited because they’ve never read a short story before and don’t realize how great they can be? How can we get more short stories to go viral in the future? No post-”Cat Person” story will enjoy quite the same novelty.

Treisman, for her part, seemed as surprised as anyone by the story’s burst of popularity ― and she couldn’t put her finger on how to replicate it with future works of fiction. “In terms of the way that word spreads through social media,” she said, “that’s still something of a novelty to me at least. I’m not sure how to game it.”

But we’ve been here before and had these same conversations ― about poetry. When Patricia Lockwood’s “Rape Joke” blew up in the summer of 2013 (tellingly, it also drew in readers with its vivid, uncensored representation of a woman’s interior experience of an interaction with a man), many were flabbergasted that a poem could go viral. The Guardian credited the poem with having “casually reawakened a generation’s interest in poetry.” In the years since, poetry has only continued to strengthen its new readership, particularly online. Nowadays, a poem going viral isn’t all that noteworthy ― it happens often enough. Poetry has become a staple in how we respond to and process events on the Internet, providing a different angle on the world we live in than can a think piece or a breaking news item.

Why can’t short fiction be like that? There are artistic purists who leap to defend the sanctity of literature from such crass things as “messages” or “political relevance.” Any discussion of which character was in the right, or who behaved selfishly or whether the story fat-shamed Robert is framed as improperly treating fiction as nonfiction. “It’s inevitable that some readers view ‘Cat Person’ as weighing in on a timely issue and offering up lessons, the way personal essays are so often inclined to do,” sighed Laura Miller in Slate. “It’s easy to get into the habit of thinking that every imaginative literary work must be made to carry an unambiguous moral.”

But there’s a reason people read the story that way: It’s offering a very realistic narrative of a communication breakdown between two real-seeming people, teasing out the ways in which things went wrong. Of course we’ll want to take lessons from that, if we can. “Cat Person,” though written well before the #MeToo moment and worth reading outside of it, does offer particular relief and insight to readers in the grip of this cultural moment, just as an essay might. Roupenian and Treisman, who both emphasized the story’s ability to speak to our current consternation over dysfunctional male-female communication, seem to be embracing the political relevance of the work.

In an interview with Treisman for The New Yorker, Roupenian explained that Margot’s resignation to sex she no longer wanted “speaks to the way that many women, especially young women, move through the world: not making people angry, taking responsibility for other people’s emotions, working extremely hard to keep everyone around them happy.” In an interview with The New York Times this week, she elaborated on the loneliness women who date men might feel, having a partner, at this moment in time, who doesn’t understand their feelings of sexual vulnerability. “That’s a pain a lot of women I know have felt acutely, especially in this past year, when all of these terrible shared experiences are becoming part of the public conversation,” Roupenian said. “Women try to talk about these experiences with their partners, and they find themselves failing. It’s an isolating feeling for both people involved.”

And while we should certainly remember the story is fiction (no, Margot and Roupenian are not the same person) and can analyze the story as a carefully crafted imaginative work, it’s hard to see what’s wrong with also discussing it as a window into a real-world problem, as Roupenian does in these interviews. That’s exactly what makes it so appealing, and what has long been one of fiction’s strengths ― especially psychological realism.

That’s not to say that fiction should trade in simplistic moral archetypes. As Miller points out, “Cat Person” resists easy judgments of its characters and instead shows two complex, flawed people. That makes it all the more valuable of a teaching tool. Real life, too, is messy and peopled by complex, flawed humans, but real life is where we have to live.",Why A New Yorker Short Story About Bad Sex Went Viral,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/12/11/why-a-new-yorker-short-story-about-bad-sex-went-viral_a_23304308/

One might think that my voice would be welcomed at Aaron Swartz Day given all that the late Internet/freedom of information activist and I share in common. For starters, we were both indicted under the same controversial federal law, the CFAA, by the same Boston U.S. Attorney’s Office and indeed under the tenure of the same notorious U.S. Attorney, Carmen Ortiz.

Both of us have been persecuted for doing the moral thing; Aaron for trying to make taxpayer-funded research available to the general public and me for stopping the torture of an innocent child (see here for Aarons biopic, “The Internet’s Own Boy” on YouTube and see here for Lee Camp’s coverage of my case or here for Red State’s, depending on your news persuasion).

We’ve both been featured by Rolling Stone for our work, see here for Aaron’s story and here for mine (although I must note that the dozen or so pages of factual corrections I submitted to Rolling Stone have yet to be made). We were both even assigned the same trial judge, though years apart. Further, both of us refused to take a plea deal because neither of us did anything wrong and both of us spent our lifes’ savings on lawyers, who had little impact.

In fact, no one who will actually be heard at Aaron Swartz Day can talk firsthand about this remarkable experience I share with Aaron. And indeed, with Carmen Ortiz thankfully no longer serving as Boston’s U.S. Attorney, no one in the future will ever come as close as I have to the trials and tribulations that pushed him to suicide.

So, why won’t my voice be heard on Aaron Swartz Day, during an event that is supposed to document Aaron’s life and experiences as well as to celebrate the free access to information for which he fought so tenaciously? It’s not because I didn’t ask to be included. Rather, it’s due to the umbrage it seems the day’s main organizer, Lisa Rein, takes to hacking and the unilateral decision she made to exclude my story. You see, the message below was sent to my wife by Rein:

This is odd to me because Rein is also Chelsea Manning’s archivist and ran one of Manning’s Twitter accounts for years. While she is obviously no fan of Anonymous, that didn’t stop her from inviting Barrett Brown and Gabriella Coleman to mark the occasion either:

Further, the comment above is simply ridiculous revisionist history. It would be difficult if not impossible to propagandize even one degree of separation between Aaron and “anything having to do with Anonymous,” let alone two, as Rein indicates. It’s so comical that here’s Steven Colbert detailing the connection between Anonymous and WikiLeaks, with which both Aaron and Manning were associated:

“You may not know that Wikileaks is protected by a global hacker nerd brigade known as Anonymous, whose commitment to openness and free exchange of information is right there in the name.” – Stephen Colbert

Now, of all Rein’s abhorrent comments to my wife, and there were many, there are only a few other things I’d like to highlight.

First, as a student of the George Carlin School of the English Language, I find the way Rein calls Aaron Swartz Day “my event” quite illuminating. I believe that if Aaron Swartz Day truly does belong to anyone, other than to the public, then that would be to Aaron himself and his family.

Additionally, Rein’s notion that I’ve “done nothing to further Aaron’s legacy” is patently ludicrous. I went on a 100-day hunger strike in prison protesting the kind of political prosecution that claimed Aaron’s life. I’ve also written dozens of articles across HuffPost and other outlets, keeping Aaron’s story spreading on both sides of the aisle. For a list of other ways I’ve furthered Aaron’s legacy, please see FreeMartyG.com.

Indeed, my work ended over a year of solitary confinement for a mentally ill man at MCC New York, exposed corrupt politicians, including some of those at the DOJ who targeted Swartz, and helps wage the war against the for-profit torture of American children. In short, as Aaron did, I’ve made a lot more of an actual impact for actual people by taking actual risks than Lisa Rein ever has. That’s because, as Rein has previously told my wife, unlike Aaron, she prefers to play a supporting role, i.e. not take any risks herself. Rather, it seems, she’ll play armchair quarterback and criticize as well as belittle those who do. Now that indeed is some distinctly unAaron-like behavior.

Further, by denying me a platform, Rein is also helping to perpetuate the kind of bullying that was endured by Swartz. Indeed, Carmen Ortiz and Stephen Heymann owe Rein quite a bit of thanks for keeping my case quiet, blocking fundraising efforts, demoralizing myself and wife, etc. What a way to celebrate Aaron’s legacy, huh? By suppressing and discouraging the next person in his shoes. Somehow, I don’t think Aaron would approve.

In fact, the comment above is so obviously wrong that when considered with its accompanying apparent reference to the movie Mean Girls below, it seems that Rein was trying to be hurtful to my wife… who has been reaching out to her fruitlessly for a long time because her spouse has been held without bail by Carmen Ortiz on CFAA charges for 20 months now.

That’s a special kind of heartless and it’s found all over Rein’s various messages to my wife.

Though I never met Aaron personally, based on his work and what others consistently say about him, I believe in reality it’s Rein’s behavior that he wouldn’t want “anything to do with.”

For the record too, I believe that if he had ever come to know about the suffering of Justina Pelletier and the thousands of other American children like her, Aaron would have courageously tried to stop it because he had a big heart, a strong moral compass, and the bravery to take personal risks to defy injustice; all of which Rein seems to lack.

I’ll let the rest of Rein’s messages speak for themselves below, and since I won’t be heard there, let me wish everyone a Happy Aaron Swartz Day. My thanks to all the people and media organizations who have helped get my message out.

Maris said regulators would have good cause to break up the big technology companies.","LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Oct 18 (Reuters) - Two of the technology industry’s top startup investors took to the stage at a conference on Wednesday to decry the power that companies such as Facebook Inc had amassed and call for a redistribution of wealth.

Bill Maris, who founded Alphabet Inc’s venture capital arm and now runs venture fund Section 32, and Sam Altman, president of startup accelerator Y Combinator, said widespread discontent over income inequality helped elect U.S. President Donald Trump and had put wealthy technology companies in the crosshairs.

“I do know that the tech backlash is going to be strong,” said Altman. “We have more and more concentrated power and wealth.”

The market capitalization of the so-called Big Five technology companies - Alphabet, Apple Inc, Amazon Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook - has doubled in the last three years to more than $3 trillion. Silicon Valley broadly has amassed significant wealth during the latest tech boom.

Altman and Maris spoke on the final day of The Wall Street Journal DLive technology conference in Southern California.

Facebook’s role in facilitating what U.S. intelligence agencies have identified as Russian interference in last year’s U.S. presidential election is an example of the immense power the social media company has amassed, the investors said.

“The companies that used to be fun and disruptive and interesting and benevolent are now disrupting our elections,” Maris said.

Altman said people “are understandably uncomfortable with that.”

Altman, who unequivocally rebuffed rumors that he would run for governor of California next year, said he expects more demands from both the public and policy makers on data privacy, limiting what personal information Facebook and others can collect.

Maris said regulators would have good cause to break up the big technology companies.

“These companies are more powerful than AT&T ever was,” he said.

Facebook said last month it had discovered an operation likely based in Russia that spent $100,000 on political ads and created 470 fake accounts and pages that spread polarizing views on political and social issues.

Altman and Maris offered few details of how to accomplish a redistribution of wealth. Maris proposed shorter term limits for elected officials and simplifying the tax code. Altman has advocated basic income, a poverty-fighting proposal in which all residents would receive a regular, unconditional sum of money from the government.",Silicon Valley Veteran Says Tech Giants 'More Powerful Than AT&T Ever Was',https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-maris-sam-altman-tech-backlash_us_59e8c44be4b00905bdaf3794?section=us_technology

Data: Statista

Facebook is no longer the place for young people. Twitter has failed to grow followers significantly in 2017.

So what can we learn from the growth of Instagram?

While Twitter, Facebook, and even Snapchat are the Wild West of social media, Instagram has created what is almost an alternate reality.

According to a Variety article, “The company strives to create a safe, happy environment.” Instagram’s CEO Kevin Systrom told Variety: “People say Instagram is super positive and optimistic.”

And a quick look at 2017 statistics provided by the Instagram prove that point in dramatic fashion.

According to Brandwatch, Instagram now reaches an average audience of 500 million people on a daily basis in the third quarter of 2017, more than double that of Snapchat or Twitter (each has fewer than 200 million daily active users).

Beyonce’s maternity photo garnered 11 million likes, making it the top “like” count for the year so far.

Preet Didbal has kicked off her term in Yuba City, California, as the first Sikh woman mayor in U.S. history. Didbal, the daughter of immigrant farm laborers, was sworn into her new position Tuesday. The single mother told HuffPost that during her term, she plans to use her platform to uplift women from a variety of backgrounds. “As a girl growing up and then as a young women, I always felt like a second-class citizen. It was always ‘you’re a girl, you can’t do that,’” Didbal said. She hopes her barrier-breaking win will influence “young women to be strong,” she added.

Courtesy of The City Of Yuba City Preet Didbal has long had a passion for women's health, and hopes her win will encourage other women.

A native of Yuba City, Didbal has served the community for some time. She was a city council member in 2014, and most recently served as vice mayor. She gained recognition for her work on women’s empowerment and public health, holding regular public forums to address community health and safety. In 2015, she was honored at California’s Third Congressional District’s Women Of The Year Awards, which recognize outstanding women in the community. As a rape survivor, Didbal told HuffPost she’s long had a passion for women’s heath and has been publicly telling her story for almost two years now. This year’s #MeToo campaign served as proof of the real change that comes with speaking out on sexual assault, she said. And as a mother of an 18-year-old daughter, she feels that it’s her duty to continue encouraging young women to have open conversations about sexual assault. It’s also crucial, she said, for the community to listen to these stories and break down the stigmas attached to sexual assault survivors and treatment.

HONOLULU ― A real estate developer in Hawaii is under scrutiny for its plans to build a residential high-rise that has two separate entrances: one for high-income residents and another for low-income earners.
“Ultimately this will be the first time we will have approved a mixed-use residential project with separate entrances,” Victor Geminiani, co-director of the Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, told Hawaii News Now.

State officials have struggled to solve Hawaii’s affordable housing crisis brought on by the island state’s high cost of living and a shortage of housing options.","This separate door has become known as the “poor door,” and it drew criticism in 2014 when developers in New York , London and West Hollywood proposed similar ideas.

The high-rise will include 78 affordable rental units for people earning 80 percent or less of the area median income, as required by Honolulu’s affordable housing strategy. The other 351 units will be market-priced condominiums. If things go as ProsPac plans, the units will be separated with two entrances.

ProsPac Holdings Group is developing the 41-story residential building in the Ala Moana neighborhood of Honolulu.

HONOLULU ― A real estate developer in Hawaii is under scrutiny for its plans to build a residential high-rise that has two separate entrances: one for high-income residents and another for low-income earners.

Daniel Simonich, an assistant project manager for ProsPac, told Honolulu Civil Beat the segregated entrances are necessary because the affordable housing renters and the condo owners will be managed by different companies and will have separate housing associations.

But the entrances and associations aren’t the only things segregating the groups.

The condo owners will be able to enjoy the property’s pool, cabanas, dog park, fitness center and theater, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The renters will be barred from using those amenities.

Simonich told Civil Beat this separation will make the costs bearable for renters.

“The renters won’t have to face the burden of maintaining all those amenities because they will be separated,” Simonich told the nonprofit investigative news site.

Social justice advocates don’t see it that way.

“Ultimately this will be the first time we will have approved a mixed-use residential project with separate entrances,” Victor Geminiani, co-director of the Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, told Hawaii News Now.

“That sends messages to all of us.”

Tom Dinell, a professor of urban planning at the University of Hawaii, told Civil Beat the separate physical entrances could “stigmatize the people who qualify for affordable units.”

“Affordable units and market units should be identical from the outside, including the entrance way.”

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo did away with poor doors in 2015 after the New York Post, The New York Times and West Side Rag published stories on a luxury building that had proposed a separate entrance for its lower-income renters years earlier, inciting local outrage.

“It’s such a visual separation,” state Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal told The New York Times in 2014. “It gets at people when they see two separate doors. It’s no longer theoretical. It looks and smells like discrimination.”

New York blocked the entrances by taking tax breaks away from affordable housing developers who separate residents by income in their projects. Buildings under construction at the time ― like the Lincoln Square tower ― were grandfathered in.

Tenants in Lincoln Square’s affordable housing felt the effects of the segregated entrances, as Rosenthal had predicted.

“The thing I don’t like most is we don’t have the same amenities,” Christina Figueras, a single mother of two, told the New York Post in 2016.

Eric Olm, a low-income renter in the same building, told the Post his windows overlook a courtyard that is restricted to only the wealthier condo owners. “It would be nice to actually get to enjoy it,” he told the newspaper.

State officials have struggled to solve Hawaii’s affordable housing crisis brought on by the island state’s high cost of living and a shortage of housing options. In May, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell unveiled a strategy to address the crisis, offering developers a $1 year lease and help with infrastructure if they build affordable housing options.

William Chen, assistant director for ProsPac in Honolulu, said their upcoming Ala Moana building actually brings together low-income and high-income earners rather than separating them.

“While most developers create a market rate tower in one location and an affordable tower in another location, our solution allows both projects to exist on the same block in the heart of Honolulu’s Ala Moana neighborhood,” Chen said in a statement to Hawaii News Now.

It's the same in New Delhi, Manchester, London, Beijing or Nairobi. Citizens and politicians have to breathe the same air. It's possible to build a strong consensus for action to opt for low-carbon solutions.

""Delhi's smog problem is caused by a variety of factors. These range from agricultural burning, the burning of waste, transport, construction and power generation, among others,"" Solheim told IANS in an online interview from Nairobi, which is hosting the UN Environment Assembly next week.

He said the priority is really to establish a scientific basis for action, using air quality monitoring technology to identify the precise sources of pollution.

""Policymakers can then use that data to prioritise areas of action and plan future change. The key here is providing clear, decisive leadership on the issue. Given the public health concerns, anyone taking firm action can be sure of winning public support,"" he observed.

Ahead of the third session of the UN Environment Assembly, where world leaders are gathering for the largest global meeting on pollution, an optimistic Solheim said there's a need for action on transport to curb emissions.

Transport accounts for nearly 18 per cent of all emissions worldwide, and over 90 per cent of the sector is still dependent on carbon-intensive fossil fuels.

""We need action on transport for two reasons. The transport sector, be it on land, in the air or at sea, is a major contributor to emissions and a driver of climate change. It's also a big cause of pollution, with an immediate detrimental impact on the health of hundreds of millions of people,"" Solheim said.

""We have started to see a shift to low-carbon solutions, but this needs to speed up. I'm convinced that the days are numbered for the internal combustion engine, with many nations now committing themselves to a time-bound phase-out of petrol and diesel vehicles,"" he said.

""But we really need to see more innovation and change in the air transport and shipping sectors.""

The UN Environment Assembly, with 193 nations as its members, aims to deliver commitments to end the pollution of air, land, waterways and oceans and to safely manage chemicals and waste.

According to Solheim, what's happening in many cities around the world is criminal, and people deserve far better.

""Living in a city should not mean being condemned to poor health and an early death. On the positive side, both policymakers and citizens are increasingly aware of the issue, and especially the costs to health, to productivity and to the environment.

""It's possible to build a strong consensus for action. The benefit here is that action on tackling poor air quality in cities is also a big part of the action we need to take on climate change,"" he said.

On stepping up action to fight oceanic pollution, he said: ""Beach clean-up initiatives are fantastic because they are a very useful tool to highlight the sheer scale of the problem and they help galvanise public support for change.

""But ultimately, we have to stop plastics getting into the oceans in the first place. For this we need stronger political leadership on the issue. Better waste management, incentives for recycling and producers taking more responsibility for where their products end up.""

Solheim, an admirer of Indian lawyer Afroz Shah's commitment and passion for clean seas, says his model of cleaning beaches can be replicated for the rest of the world.

For Solheim, the solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions lies in steering electricity sector transformation towards green technology.

China and India are both undergoing extraordinary change, and the shift to renewables in both the countries has been one of the most promising trends of recent years.

""I'm convinced that both nations will emerge as global energy leaders if they continue on this path,"" said Solheim, who recently tried out one of the bicycles delivered by Mobike that will be available for delegates to move around during the UN Environment Assembly.

He believes the bike aims to provide affordable and clean transport solutions for the cities.","There's No Magic Solution To Delhi's Smog Problem, Says United Nations Environment Head",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/30/theres-no-magic-solution-to-delhis-smog-problem-says-united-nations-environment-head_a_23292515/

Uber announced on Nov. 21 that the personal data of 57 million users, including 600,000 drivers in the United States, were stolen in a breach that occurred in October 2016, and that it paid the hacker $100,000 to destroy the information. But the company did not reveal any information about the hacker or how it paid him the money.

Uber made the payment last year through a program designed to reward security researchers who report flaws in a company’s software, these people said. Uber’s bug bounty service - as such a program is known in the industry - is hosted by a company called HackerOne, which offers its platform to a number of tech companies.

Reuters was unable to establish the identity of the hacker or another person who sources said helped him. Uber spokesman Matt Kallman declined to comment on the matter.

Newly appointed Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi fired two of Uber’s top security officials when he announced the breach last month, saying the incident should have been disclosed to regulators at the time it was discovered, about a year before.

It remains unclear who made the final decision to authorize the payment to the hacker and to keep the breach secret, though the sources said then-CEO Travis Kalanick was aware of the breach and bug bounty payment in November of last year.

Kalanick, who stepped down as Uber CEO in June, declined to comment on the matter, according to his spokesman.

A payment of $100,000 through a bug bounty program would be extremely unusual, with one former HackerOne executive saying it would represent an “all-time record.” Security professionals said rewarding a hacker who had stolen data also would be well outside the normal rules of a bounty program, where payments are typically in the $5,000 to $10,000 range.

HackerOne hosts Uber’s bug bounty program but does not manage it, and plays no role in deciding whether payouts are appropriate or how large they should be.

HackerOne CEO Marten Mickos said he could not discuss an individual customer’s programs. “In all cases when a bug bounty award is processed through HackerOne, we receive identifying information of the recipient in the form of an IRS W-9 or W-8BEN form before payment of the award can be made,” he said, referring to U.S. Internal Revenue Service forms.

According to two of the sources, Uber made the payment to confirm the hacker’s identity and have him sign a nondisclosure agreement to deter further wrongdoing. Uber also conducted a forensic analysis of the hacker’s machine to make sure the data had been purged, the sources said.

One source described the hacker as “living with his mom in a small home trying to help pay the bills,” adding that members of Uber’s security team did not want to pursue prosecution of an individual who did not appear to pose a further threat.

The Florida hacker paid a second person for services that involved accessing GitHub, a site widely used by programmers to store their code, to obtain credentials for access to Uber data stored elsewhere, one of the sources said.

GitHub said the attack did not involve a failure of its security systems. “Our recommendation is to never store access tokens, passwords, or other authentication or encryption keys in the code,” that company said in a statement.

‘SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS’

Uber received an email last year from an anonymous person demanding money in exchange for user data, and the message was forwarded to the company’s bug bounty team in what was described as Uber’s routine practice for such solicitations, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Bug bounty programs are designed mainly to give security researchers an incentive to report weaknesses they uncover in a company’s software. But complicated scenarios can emerge when dealing with hackers who obtain information illegally or seek a ransom.

Some companies choose not to report more aggressive intrusions to authorities on the grounds that it can be easier and more effective to negotiate directly with hackers in order to limit any harm to customers.

Uber’s $100,000 payout and silence on the matter at the time was extraordinary under such a program, according to Luta Security founder Katie Moussouris, a former HackerOne executive.

“If it had been a legitimate bug bounty, it would have been ideal for everyone involved to shout it from the rooftops,” Moussouris said.

Uber’s failure to report the breach to regulators, even though it may have felt it had dealt with the problem, was an error, according to people inside and outside the company who spoke to Reuters.

“The creation of a bug bounty program doesn’t allow Uber, their bounty service provider, or any other company the ability to decide that breach notification laws don’t apply to them,” Moussouris said.

Uber fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, and a deputy, attorney Craig Clark, over their roles in the incident.

“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Khosrowshahi, said in a blog post announcing the hack last month.

Clark worked directly for Sullivan but also reported to Uber’s legal and privacy team, according to three people familiar with the arrangement. It is unclear whether Clark informed Uber’s legal department, which typically handled disclosure issues.

Sullivan and Clark did not respond to requests for comment.

In an August interview with Reuters, Sullivan, a former prosecutor and Facebook Inc security chief, said he integrated security engineers and developers at Uber “with our lawyers and our public policy team who know what regulators care about.”","Uber Paid 20-Year-Old Florida Man $100,000 To Keep Quiet About Data Breach",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-data-breach-florida-man-paid-hacker_us_5a29605be4b0b185e539db5d?section=us_business

Of course, Uber is not alone in making this very big bet on industrial-scale autonomy, as it joins the ranks of Tesla and many others that are successfully deploying autonomous vehicles. The difficulty for Uber in making this move, is that up until now its business model was relatively benign in pooling “stranded assets” and “stranded talent” into use. These stranded assets were a combination of peoples’ downtime and under employment, or their vehicles, which often idled on the side of the road or in their garages incurring carrying costs.

When your side hustle turns on you, it is certainly bittersweet and the growing risk that autonomous vehicles portend for professional or part-time drivers suggests another wave of turbulence and market adjustment in Uber’s wake. Clearly the move to autonomy will not occur overnight, but if Uber’s 8-year assent to global dominance of the ride sharing market is any guide, this move to autonomy will likely occur rather swiftly. Indeed, the company is already piloting city-scale autonomous livery in cities like Pittsburgh. The advent of driverless technology, along with Uber’s impressive public policy capabilities, means it may soon clear the regulatory and public safety hurtles that stand in the way of its next big bet. This move also continues to chip away at the lucrative logistics and package delivery market, which has long been dominated by a triopoly of FedEx, UPS and national postal services. These entrenched players are being put on notice not only by Uber’s moves into delivery of food and conveniences in key cities, but also by Amazon’s move into drone-based fulfillment and brick and mortar with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.

One of the main challenges with industrial autonomy is the question of where legal liability resides, as well as lingering ethical dilemmas. In the mature auto insurance market, for example, it is widely understood and globally mandated that the driver or owner of a vehicle carries third-party liability protection, as well as bodily injury and property damage coverage to indemnify others. When the driver is removed from this equation the line of liability is not only blurred, it is completely removed. This creates a new class of liability that many firms racing to enter the autonomous world may not fully appreciate and may come to regret. This new vicarious liability is in effect a product liability issue, whereby the owner, passenger or others who utilize a product or service must be held harmless should an issue arise. Pricing this emerging risk will of course change the economic model and the risk-reward trade off that companies like Uber, Tesla and Volvo must contend with. Sadly, as with many emerging risks of this nature, the biggest lessons and price corrections will come in the context of failures.

Indeed, the global insurance industry, particularly those players operating in commodity markets such as auto insurance, should join Uber’s drivers in taking heed. Elon Musk, Tesla’s innovative CEO, has gone as far as signaling the irrelevance of auto insurance for Tesla vehicles, especially when their autonomous features are engaged, as he believes this is a better form of risk management than relying on distracted drivers behind the wheel. With these types of deep assurance moves, the line between traditional auto insurance and warranties may be erased, along with the price transparency and financial pooling power insurers have garnered over the years. Herein Uber’s less heralded breakthrough innovation of on-off usage-based insurance may serve as a guide for appropriate risk-sharing between owners, passengers and the creators of autonomous products or services. In short, when autonomous features are engaged product warranties can takeover, when they are disengaged, the owner or driver are on-risk.

Of course, this toggle feature and the concept of appropriate risk-transfer in the autonomous vehicle market must not turn a blind eye to rampant cyber threats and so-called internet of things (IoT) risks, which like industrial autonomy also accelerate according to Moore’s law. Indeed, the recent revelation that Uber paid $100,000 to cyber criminals who gained access to 57 million customer records, speaks to the vulnerability of platform-based businesses and the inherent lack of trust with breach disclosure. What if this same type of exploit compromised autonomous vehicle systems or safety features? Against this backdrop, regulators, consumers and public safety officials would be wise in keeping their foot near the brakes (if brakes are still mechanical) as the pace of industrial autonomy accelerates. Indeed, the best cybersecurity and road safety investment is a well-trained driver.","24,000 Uber Drivers May Lose Their Side Hustle",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/24000-uber-drivers-may-lose-their-side-hustle_us_5a16e58ae4b0250a107bfe24?section=us_business

Gimple stressed how important the next episode, ostensibly Carl’s last appearance as a living person, will be. “The next episode is really critical to the whole story of it, to Carl’s story, and to how Carl’s story affects everyone else,” he said. “This is just the start of that. I really hope people see that as well. It’s amazing work by Chandler and [Andrew Lincoln], Danai Gurira, and everyone else. And there is, I hope, some meaning to be drawn from it.”

“I’m just thinking about Chandler, and the cast and crew and all the people put together, but it’s tough,” he said. “I knew it would be tough for the people who have been following the story for so long, and it’s the kind of turns the story takes that are so painful.”

Before HuffPost jumped on the phone with Gimple, AMC emailed to say there would be “no comment” from the showrunner on Riggs’ father’s Facebook message. However, during our conversation, Gimple did describe how hard it’s been for him since Carl’s impending death was revealed.

William Riggs, Chandler’s father, also posted an emotional message on Facebook after the episode, saying how hard it was to watch his son get “fired” and adding that he didn’t trust Gimple or AMC. He later deleted the message.

Fans were crushed over the fate of the young man who grew up on the show, but perhaps not as much as Riggs himself. Following the show, The Hollywood Reporter released an interview in which he called the news of his character’s death “devastating” for him and his family. He explained that he’d just bought a house in Senoia, Georgia, near where the AMC series is filmed.

In the final moments of Sunday’s episode, Carl (Chandler Riggs) revealed a zombie bite on his side. In the world of “The Walking Dead,” that’s basically a death warrant.

The “Walking Dead” showrunner is used to dealing with all kinds of reactions to shocking moments on the show, but the latest jaw-dropper ― which happened during the midseason finale, “How It’s Gotta Be” ― has proved especially difficult.

If you think your day has been tough, tell that to Scott Gimple.

What were the conversations [in the writing room] like when you decided this is how the story would break?

It was all just story. When we’re planning the story, there’s all these different iterations that are played out into the future. ... The map of the show is all these 14 paths. This was one of those 14 paths.

Can you say what some of those other paths were?

I really can’t get into that. The “why” of it is played out on screen ... but there’s stuff in this that affects things years from now.

At what point did you know it had to be Carl?

I definitely don’t want to pin that one down either, but I will say the possibility of that fork of the map had been there. We talk about all those different iterations.

There were rumors that Chandler’s character would be written off after his college announcement in 2016. Did that have anything to do with it?

No, I mean that would’ve been outside the story, unless we were approached or something like that. But, no, it’s always just about the story.

What was the conversation like when you told him?

Two or three years ago, I figured out that I should never get into the private conversations that we have about this stuff. It’s so personal. I wouldn’t want to talk about what happened behind the scenes like that. It’s very much about what happened on screen.

Anything to say to all those Carl fans out there?

Carl is one of the most important characters on the series, and this turn in his story is going to indelibly affect everything moving forward.

So why Carl and not someone like Morgan?

I think it’ll be apparent as to how this affects the story in seismic ways, at least what this story entails. There’s a million different ways it could go, but people will see the way it goes.

You said on “Talking Dead” that this will play out the way bites play out on the show. But there’s a theory that Carl could’ve been bit by a Whisperer [a human in a zombie disguise]. What are your thoughts on that?

What I said last night on “Talking Dead” is true. This bite will play out as we’ve seen bites play out on the show. That’s a very cool, imaginative, intense theory, but this bite plays out as we’ve seen it play out.

What are you proudest of after the episode?

It was a very difficult episode to do emotionally and to execute. It was a very ambitious episode. All the writers, the productions staff, the [executive producers]. David Leslie Johnson and Angela Kang, who wrote the script. And Michael E. Satrazemis, who did such an amazing job directing it. I’m just proud how everyone came together. I’m so proud of Chandler and the performance that he gave, but people haven’t seen anything yet. Both in our next episode, but just in Chandler’s work moving forward. He’s a remarkably talented young man, just came out with some new music that people should check out, and he’s diving into projects immediately.

But he’s not dead on the show. There’s an incredible episode coming up, and I do hope it contextualizes all of this. I do hope people check it out because it really is some of the finest acting work we’ve had on the series, and it’s all Chandler.

What’s the challenge moving forward without one of the most important characters on the show?

The challenge, certainly we had to think about this, is to tell the stories from the [comic books]. They’re going to be in very different ways now. We’ve always done it. There’s this butterfly effect that happens with characters that are on the show that weren’t in the book, or rather aren’t currently in the books, that were in the book, and vice versa. Then there’s characters that weren’t a part of the book like Daryl, and there’s this butterfly effect that affects everything, and it changes the “who” sometimes and the “how” sometimes, but we really want to get to the moments from the book that had me giving [creator Robert Kirkman] money every month. And I still do sometimes.

I love the stories from the book. When I started on the show, I wanted to tell them exactly like the book, and Robert was very open to do it loosely and change things because he had told those stories and told them so well. I still want to tell those stories with great fidelity but with changes to surprise the fans and potentially enhance the story in some ways, just by virtue of knowing years ahead things that we could do. It’s a challenge, but it’s a challenge we’ve met before. We have a great group of people to do it, and we’ve already thought a lot about it.",'Walking Dead' Showrunner Says It's Been Tough Since Shocking Death Reveal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walking-dead-death-reveal-showrunner-scott-gimple_us_5a2ec44ee4b0ce3b3444874e

In 2008, we started our relationship. You were down for anything and only hung out with my closest friends. We told inappropriate jokes, talked about drugs and laughed about stupid sh*t we had done earlier in our lives. You wanted to know what was on my mind and I'd always tell you the truth.

Flash forward almost a decade into our relationship and things have drastically changed.

I'm still the same person I have always been. Abrasive, heavily sarcastic, and extremely alpha are some of the phrases used to describe me still, after all these years. Meanwhile, you've changed and done a complete 180 on me. You've gone soft, delicate and get offended by almost everything I say.

This is why I'm breaking up with you. I can't continue to be a part of your downward spiral of trying to please everyone. It's just not me and it's not what I want to be a part of. I wish you all the luck in life and I know you will make lots of people happy, I just can't be one of them. It's not you; it's me and I'm moving on.

___

I first signed up for Facebook in 2008. I met my oldest son's mom on the site and it changed my life. Literally I've made millions of dollars in the last decade from Facebook. I've met some of my best friends and even become sort of famous from the site. Facebook has been the single biggest blessing in my lifetime.

That's why the above letter was so hard to write. I'm breaking up with the love of my life. Allow me to explain.

In 2010, I lost my job. I had no idea what I was going to do and the job supply wasn't exactly overfilled back then. I found a program on how to manage social media and I knew I was on to something. I started my own business as a social media manager. I spent 10 hours a day convincing thousands of people to join Facebook and post often. I was Facebook's #1 cheerleader.

In 2014, I learned Facebook ads and since then I've spent over $500,000 in advertising as well as convinced thousands of others to do the same. I've sent millions of dollars’ worth of business to Facebook this year alone.

Just last year I was selected as one of the top Facebook marketers in the world.

In the last two years, though things have gotten weird for me on the site. It all started when I grew my fan page. I went from 8,000 likes to over 100,000 in less than a year. It was at that time someone at Facebook started watching me closely. I made the occasional right-leaning post and Facebook started restricting my posts.

At first, I thought it was all in my head but after a while I realized someone was throttling my posts. Although I was disappointed and downright pissed, I knew there was nothing I could do about it, so I just worked harder at coming up with great content.

I guess that wasn't enough for whoever over at Facebook.

One day, while I was working I saw a friend make a post containing a political joke. I made a sarcastic comment on the post, and I went on about my business. When I tried to login to Facebook a little while later, I noticed I'd been completely logged out of the system. As I logged back in, I learned I had violated community standards and that I would be blocked from the site for seven days.

I got kicked off Facebook for joking with one of my friends. My mind was blown. Since when had Facebook started blocking people for jokes? I had no idea this was even a thing or that it was possible. Yet here I was, blocked from the site and scratching my head.

After the ban, I got back on and posted about being kicked off. None of my friends (who often say way worse stuff than me) had ever been kicked off. If you think about it, my friend, who posted the joke, didn't get banned. I did, for commenting on it. I'm not one to feel like a victim or as if someone is picking on me, so I just chalked it up as a learning lesson.

A month or so later the same thing happened.

I got kicked off for another week for sarcastically commenting on a political post. Someone at Facebook has to have been watching me. I don't know why they put me on a watch list. I don't vote Republican or Democrat. I don't promote any candidates and I don't spew any hate speech. I'm mostly just posting jokes on the site. But I was getting worried because they had kicked me off twice and I didn't even know why.

Flash ahead to this February when I got an email from my assistant. It was a forwarded email from someone in our 60,000 member Facebook group. Apparently, whoever it was, was fired from their job over a sarcastic Facebook post. We joke in the group a lot and someone took a screenshot and sent it to the poster's boss, getting him fired. Turns out, that same person did this to 4-5 other people, too. The problem was, we had no clue who was doing this, so we couldn't kick them out.

So, I made a long post about it and in the end jokingly said, ""Whoever is the snitch, kill yourself."" When I went to log back into Facebook later, I noticed I was completely logged out of everything again. I was banned for 30 days. Of course, I don't want anyone to go kill themselves and if you read the post it was in a joking tone. Yet FB kicked me off with no warning.

As luck would have it, I met a person who is one of the higher ups at Facebook and I asked this person to see what was going on with me. He mentioned that I was red flagged and basically refused to comment any further. I didn't know that I was that important. They red flagged me then gagged the dude I had just met.

Is this Facebook or the CIA?

I decided it wasn't worth it and I would stop posting abrasive, humorous stuff, because whoever is red flagging me at Facebook clearly can't take a joke.

Everything was good, no issues were had and all was smooth until about a week ago. One of my military friends shared a link with fake news about Trump banning ""trans"" people from the military. I commented that ISIS is not scared to fight trannies. Now, I didn't know that tranny wasn't PC and nor do I really care. I don't have time to keep up with what special interest group wants to be called what. I have a life to live. I thought ""tranny"" was short for ""transvestite"" but it turns out both of those terms are offensive. I had no clue, I've never met a trans person in my life.

So, they kicked me off for 30 days again!

The message this go-round was that I had violated community standards. Now, I don't get it. I see all sorts of hateful comments, people using derogatory terms and everything else, without consequence. Even Snoop said he was going to kill Trump, our president and he didn't get kicked off. The one lady wiped her ass with our flag and didn't get kicked off. But me, I've been kicked off four times now. For very minor things.

I don't know how many people spend seven figures with Facebook in ads, but I imagine it's not a lot. You'd think I'd be a valued customer, but I don't even have a rep to get a hold of there. So, I'm just dealing with the block I guess.

This morning I woke up and checked my Instagram account. They blocked me on there, too.

I don't even engage on that site so I have no idea what is going on. The site says my account is restricted, no time frame, no reason why.

Facebook is trying to run me off social media.

Now mind you, I have 111,000 followers on Instagram and over 200,000 on Facebook. It's obvious that people want to listen to me and hear what I have to say. Facebook is trying to silence my influence and I have no clue why. I've read the community terms and they are so vague and broad that the only way you can be in full compliance is by not posting at all.

I'm not sure what's going on over there at Facebook these days. They are trending fake stories; they make left-leaning content viral and they are banning real people like me for no real reason other than disagreeing with an opinion. I'd like to say I'm never gonna use Facebook again, but I still have an advertising business to run. However, what I am going to do is hire a social media manager to run my page and never look at it again.",Facebook Police: There's No Such Thing As Free Speech On Social Media,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-police-theres-no-such-thing-as-free-speech_us_5a045e95e4b055de8d096ae2?section=us_technology

TRUMP’S APPROVAL RATING

-Among the public: 43% approve of Donald Trump’s job as president, while 52% disapprove

-Among Democrats: 13% approve, 85% disapprove

-Among Republicans: 84% approve, 13% disapprove

-Among independents: 40% approve, 51% disapprove

-On the economy: 45% approve, 45% disapprove

-On health care: 36% approve, 54% disapprove

-On foreign policy: 41% approve, 49% disapprove

WHAT THE POLLS ARE SAYING - There’s no shortage of polling delving into opinions on Trump’s first 100 days in office, although there is a notable scarcity of good headlines for Trump in the mix. We’ve rounded up some of the key takeaways from the latest surveys.

Opinions on Trump are deeply polarized - Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto: “Ratings of Donald Trump are far more partisan than ratings of his immediate predecessors were at this point in their presidencies: both Presidents Obama and Bush enjoyed higher ratings from the opposing political party at the 100-day mark. Mr. Trump also gets lower ratings [than] they did among independents.” [CBS]

Voters don’t think he’s bringing real change, but do see a brightening economic picture - Dana Blanton: “Trump’s victory came from voters’ desire for change ― a big part of which was ‘draining the swamp.’ Yet only 43 percent think the president is succeeding in bringing real change to Washington. More, 50 percent, say he’s failing….The number saying the economy is in ‘poor’ shape is lower than it’s been in more than a decade. By an 18-point margin, 52-34 percent, voters see the nation’s job situation improving ― the first time since 2004 that more than half say so.” [Fox]

Fewer now believe he’s keeping his promises - Ryan Teague Beckwith: “According to a TIME-SurveyMonkey poll conducted last week, just 25% of Americans believe that Trump ‘keeps his promises,’ down from 31% in a similar poll in early February….Just 26% of Americans said that Trump accomplished most or almost all of the things he said he would do in his first 100 days, down from the 40% who expected that he would do so in a similar survey just after his inauguration.” [Time]

Trump isn’t expanding his base - Jennifer Agiesta: “Overall, 44% say they approve of Trump’s handling of the presidency, 54% disapprove. That’s about the same as in each of the two previous CNN/ORC polls taken after his inauguration….The poll finds declining ratings for Trump’s handling of two issues that have been top priorities since he took office ― health care and immigration.” [CNN]

And his image remains largely what it was in January - Kathy Frankovic: “What Americans saw in President Trump as he was inaugurated nearly 100 days ago is more or less the same things they see today: opinions of his qualities and his Presidency have changed little. The public is more negative than positive about his performance, and most continue to find weaknesses in his honesty, empathy and temperament.” [YouGov]

Millennials are not impressed - Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, with GfK: “As the first 100 days of the administration nears, 32% of 18 to 29 year old Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s job performance overall…[Y]oung Americans’ approval of President Trump’s handling of the economy is at 37%. Furthermore on other issues, the poll finds his approval of dealing with ISIS at 33%, health care at 30%, climate change at 28% and performance on race relations at 27%.” [Harvard IOP]

But Trump voters have few regrets - UVA, in conjunction with Public Opinion Strategies (R): “A new University of Virginia Center for Politics poll of Trump voters shows his approval rating at 93% with these voters, though just 42% ‘strongly approve’ while 51% ‘somewhat approve.’...To the extent that Trump voters expressed concern about the president, they worried about his tweeting….Looking ahead to the 2018 midterm election, 78% of respondents said they planned to vote for the Republican candidate in their House district, 2% for the Democratic candidate, and 19% undecided.” [Sabato’s Crystal Ball]

WHAT DO TRUMP’S RATINGS MEAN FOR THE MIDTERMS? - Harry Enten: “[P]residential approval is not a great measure of the more immediate electoral issue: How will the president’s party do in the midterm elections? By all means, keep one eye on Trump’s approval rating, but keep the other on the generic congressional ballot — a longstanding poll question that pits a nameless Republican against a nameless Democrat in a race for the House. Approval ratings have historically jumped all over the place, and even on the eve of the midterms, they do a relatively poor job of forecasting the election results. The generic ballot, in contrast, has tended to be far more telling. And the generic ballot polls conducted since Trump became president suggest that House Republicans are on track to suffer a potentially major defeat in the 2018 midterm elections. The relationship between how the House majority party fares on the generic ballot at this point and how it does in the next midterm election is messy. Republicans weren’t polling well in the first half of 2013, for example, but went on to dominate the 2014 midterms….[But] when we look at the generic ballot numbers this early in the cycle while also accounting for who holds the White House, the generic ballot has forecasted midterm House results fairly well.” [538]

HUFFPOST POLLSTER IS NOW TRACKING THE UK ELECTION - United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May has called for a snap general election to be held June 8. Currently, the Conservative Party is in the lead with 46 percent, per HuffPost’s aggregate, followed by the Labour Party with 29 percent. The Liberal Democrats stand at 11 percent and UKIP and the Scottish National Party each receive about 5 percent. [Pollster chart]

Singer John Legend has been very vocal about his opposition to Trump, recently telling TMZ that he thinks he’s a “terrible president” when asked about his first 100 days in office.

“He’s manifestly unqualified, not curious, not good at legislating or doing anything that his job requires,” Legend said. “I can’t say anything nice about the guy. I think he’s one of the worst people I’ve ever encountered in public life.”

Legend’s feelings on Trump aren’t what you would call groundbreaking when you consider that a new CNN/ORC poll found that Trump had the lowest approval ratings of any newly-elected president as he approaches the 100-day mark, with 54 percent saying they disapprove of Trump’s handling of the presidency.

Yet those people who likely share the same feelings as Legend, and many whom are probably more qualified, aren’t asked if they are considering getting into politics in the future.

Thankfully, Legend is not considering it. He seems to realize that being famous and having an opinion doesn’t make you qualified to run for office.

He point-blank told TMZ he would not consider running for office. “I don’t want to be in office. I do what I do and I love what I do. I’m an activist, but not a politician.”

Not being able to take a hint, TMZ’s cameraman continued to press Legend, telling him that he thought the American people might vote him in. Legend wisely responded, “That’s not the point. I don’t want to run.”

For two decades, the press has been pestering George Clooney with the same question, though his answer has always been no. “Believe me, you don’t want me in politics,” he told the Associated Press in 2006.

And with the frenzied days of buying just ahead, now is the time to inform yourself. Otherwise you could end up overpaying ― I mean really overpaying ― for your next laptop or desktop.

Turns out there’s a time for everything, when it comes to a new PC.

Wait for the new chips

Don’t pay attention to the new models, but instead the new chipsets ― the things that power the PCs. “My advice is to buy a new PC right after a new motherboard chipsets come out,” says David Cox, the CEO of an internet company in Cheyenne, Wyoming. “You will get the most longevity out of your system that way.” AMD and Intel have released new chips recently. Competition between the two have driven down prices and introduced a lot of cool, new features, according to Cox. “Last time consumers had this much buying power was before 2005,” he adds.

Tune in to “special” days

Antony Vitillo, an artificial reality developer, says certain days are best to buy a PC, beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday. “Some of them are celebrated by one particular website, like Amazon Prime Day,” he says. Wait for these days to see what deals are being offered. But also, know that there will be other windows that open later. In other words, if you miss Black Friday, don’t worry; Cyber Monday is just a few hours away.

Hang on for PC buying season

Yes, there’s a season, says Yanatha Desouvre, an information systems professional who has watched the ebb and flow of computer prices for the last two decades. Fall is the best time for a PC purchase. “Manufacturers have back-to-school sales, including printer bundles and other accessories,” says Desouvre. The holiday season is also a good time, with retailers trying to meet or exceed their fourth-quarter sales goals. But perhaps the lowest prices come to those who wait a little longer, a few days after the holidays, when the discounting can reach a frenzy. The worst time? Summer, since prices are high and it’s near the end of the product life cycle. Never buy a PC during the summer.

Purchasing data backs up that assertion. For laptop computers, for example, prices typically drop an extra 8 percent to 25 percent in August and early September, according to DealNews.com. In fact, August had 24 percent more computer deals last year than September did. The PC deals pick up again in November with Black Friday sales, according to the site.

Find out if the coast is clear

PCs rely on components, and the cost of those parts can fluctuate based on demand and other factors. “For example, an earthquake or hurricane can affect pricing of hard drives and memory by creating a temporary shortage of supply to the current demand,” explains Tim Lynch, publisher of Psychsoftpc.com, a computer site. For example, that happened to computer monitors when the production of quality glass was effected by a natural disaster, he says. Always check to make sure your computer’s prices are not artificially inflated by an outside event

Missed it? March madness awaits

Yet another buying window opens up in March, at the end of the first quarter, according to Todd Millecam, the CEO of SWYM Systems. “They’re getting rid of the stock they couldn’t move for Christmas,” he says. “This is also the best time to buy components to build your own PC.” In other words, manufacturers and retailers are often under immense pressure to move inventory and meet sales goals, and those can favor the buyer at the end of the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year. So watch for aggressive prices in the final days of March.

There’s a bigger question if you’re in the market for a new PC. Should you wait for the newest computer or buy one that’s been available for a while? That’s worth addressing in a story about seasonality, since the most important season is yours. PC expert Itai Danan says consumer typically find the best value in the middle range of the new family of processors.

“Even getting a PC with the lowest speed processor of the newest platform, rather than a faster one of the previous platform, is advantageous. Not only will it last longer but it will also stay upgradable for longer since memory and other compatible components will be available longer.”

Finally, when you have an opportunity to buy a discounted PC, seize it. Sale quantities are limited, notes Eric Rintell, president of Rintell Technologies. “You have to be swift,” he says. “In the past, I have woken up in the middle of the night to ensure that I can purchase the sale PC.”

This is what the Rajasthan DGP, O P Galhotra, had to say about the brutal murder of a Muslim labourer from West Bengal who was hacked with a cleaver and then set on fire in Rajasthan by a man who has now been identified as one Shambhu Lal Regar, a resident of Rajsamand, over a suspected case of 'love jihad'.

The brutality of the crime, that Regar filmed, has left many shocked.

A day after his half-charred body was found, his family wants his killer to be hanged.

""We want those who killed my husband so brutally and showed it to the world be hanged.... We do not know what love jihad is. He has grandchildren.

In a social media post the suspect said it was a ""warning"" to those who commit 'love jihad' - a term many Hindu activists use to describe marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men they claim are converting women to their faith to propagate Islam.

Police recovered the body of Afrazul, a labourer from Malda, who is seen crying and pleading for help in the disturbing video that Regar used the help of an accomplice to shoot.

He is seen hacking at the labourer, as he tries to escape. When the victim falls to the ground, he pours kerosene on him and sets him on fire.

Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria told News18 that a Special Investigation Team has been set up today to investigate the killing. Regar has been arrested.

Though police are yet to confirm the motive of the murder, the ""love jihad"" claim surfaced after Regar posted a video on social media justifying his action. He said he killed Afrazul to save a woman from 'love jihad'. The cause of murder could be old enmity between the two men, police have said.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year... well, not for everyone. While images of love and joy fill storefronts, TV screens and magazine pages, for many people, the reality of the holidays isn’t so cheerful. Between stressful end-of-year deadlines, family dysfunction and loss, poor eating and drinking habits, and increasingly cold and dark winter days, it’s easy for the holiday season to feel not-so-merry and bright. Constant reminders of others’ happy seasons can additionally serve as a painful reminder of the happiness and love that’s lacking in our own lives. For this reason, the month of December can be a particularly difficult time of year for those dealing with family conflict, loss, break ups, divorce, loneliness and mental health issues. Feelings of depression and negative mood affect many people at the holidays, and not just those who have been diagnosed with clinical depression. While there hasn’t been data to suggest an actual rise in depression rates and suicides in December ― research has found that depression and suicide actually peak in the spring ― some experts say that the holiday blues are a very real phenomenon. And of course, there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that this is the case. Here are some of the risk factors of holiday depression, and how you can avoid them: Setting up unrealistic expectations.

Hoping for a picture-perfect White Christmas holiday is setting yourself up for not only disappointment, but potentially symptoms of depression. “People have this anticipation or fantasy of the holiday that you would see on TV,” psychiatrist Mark Sichel, author of Healing From Family Rifts, told HuffPost, adding that his practice gets much busier after the holidays. “Actually, it’s never exactly as people anticipate and it’s often disappointing. There’s often strife within families that comes out at holiday times.” Especially when it comes to family especially, it’s important to manage expectations during the holidays and not hope for things to be perfect. If holidays tend to be a time of conflict in your family, or you’ve recently experienced the loss of a loved one, putting pressure on your family to all get along or to be cheerful could lead to disappointment and additional anxiety. Being mindful of what you do have to be thankful for ― your sister who always makes family gatherings bearable, getting a week off of work, or just the promise of a fresh start with the beginning of the new year ― can help combat feelings of deficiency and lack. “Realize that the holidays do end ― and take stock of what you can be grateful for,” says Sichel. “Having gratitude is probably the best antidote against depression.” Trying to do too much. At the holidays, the pressure of trying to do everything ― plan the perfect holiday, make it home to see your family, say yes to every event, meet those year-end deadlines ― can be enough to send anyone into a tail spin. And if you’re prone to anxiety and depression, stress (and a lack of sleep) can take a significant toll on your mood. A heightened pressure and fear of not getting everything done are some of the most common triggers for the holiday blues, according to Sichel. “Being bogged down by perfectionism” can contribute to feeling down, says Sichel. “Many people feel they just can’t do the right thing, that family members are always disappointed in them.” Comparing your insides to someone else’s outsides.

Both in real life and on social media, it can be difficult to avoid comparing yourself with others around Christmastime. If you have a less-than-perfect family, a past trauma from this time of year, or just a less-than-full holiday dance card, comparing your holiday experience with other peoples’ is a recipe for increased sadness and isolation. And as Sichel points out, these comparisons tend to be skewed — and they tend to make us feel bad about ourselves. “People’s basis for comparison is not based in reality, because most families have issues and most people do not have the perfect Christmas that they would like to have or that they’d remember from their childhood,” says Sichel. Slacking on self-care. For many people, December is the busiest time of the year. When work pressures pile up and the calendar gets full with social obligations, the routines that normally keep us healthy and happy — yoga class, morning runs, healthy home-cooked meals, a meditation practice — are usually the first thing to fall by the wayside. In addition to increased stress, eating poorly and drinking excessively can also exacerbate issues like stress, anxiety and depression. “Take care of yourself — don’t overeat and over-drink,” says Sichel. “Do your regular routines of exercise and whatever keeps you together during the year.” Sichel emphasizes the importance of avoiding binge drinking. Alcohol is everywhere during the holidays, and if you’re struggling with feeling down, it may be wise to avoid drinking as much as possible — alcohol is known to worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression. Experiencing symptoms of seasonal affective disorder.

If you tend to start feeling down when winter approaches each year, and those negative feelings don’t go away after the holidays are over, you may have seasonal affective disorder (SAD). According to Sichel, many people who think they are suffering from a case of holiday blues may actually be suffering from SAD, a form of depression that’s brought on by the change of seasons.

The Indian government's fraud case against tycoon Vijay Mallya is baseless and politically motivated, his defence lawyer told a London court on Tuesday as she battled to prevent his extradition to his home country.

Mallya, who lives in Britain, stands accused in India of fraudulently palming off losses from his now defunct Kingfisher Airlines onto banks by taking out loans he had no intention of repaying.

His defence team argue that he is being used as a scapegoat by Indian politicians of all stripes to deflect public anger at the accumulation of bad debts by state-owned banks.

The 61-year-old, nicknamed ""the King of Good Times"" after the slogan on bottles of one of his premium beers and his hard partying lifestyle, had business interests ranging from aviation to liquor.

Vijay Mallya, founder and chairman of Kingfisher Airlines Ltd., stands outside Westminster Magistrates' Court after it was evacuated in London, U.K., on Monday, Dec. 4, 2017.

He is also the co-owner of Formula One motor racing team Force India.

The case against him centres on a series of loans Kingfisher obtained from Indian banks, especially state-owned lender IDBI. The banks want to recover a total of about $1.4 billion that the state says the defunct airline owes.

Mallya's British defence lawyer, Clare Montgomery, told Westminster Magistrates Court that India had made a series of serious allegations against him and others that did not have ""a shred of evidence"" to back them up.

She also said that the Indian government's case revealed a ""shocking"" lack of appreciation of how companies function and of basic realities such as the effects of incorporation and the rights of shareholders.

""Economically and legally, it is impossible to palm off losses onto banks by borrowing to pass on the cost of failure,"" she said.

Montgomery said she would call witnesses later in the two-week hearing to give evidence on what she called the ""political ramifications"" of the case.

She accused several Indian parties including the ruling BJP of ""making political capital from the Mallya case on the assumption there was a fraud"".

Montgomery said India's Central Bureau of Investigation, which is prosecuting the case, had a ""long and inglorious history of being politically motivated in the cases it brings"".

She also criticised prison conditions in India, saying that they were worse than in Russia, a country to which British courts have on several occasions refused to extradite suspects for that reason.

Montgomery said there were competing narratives, fraud versus business failure, and that no reasonable jury would be able to reach a safe conclusion that there had been a deliberate intent to defraud.

Mallya, the focus of intense media interest in India, arrived wearing a dark suit and yellow tie and was mobbed by cameramen as he walked into the building.

Inside the courtroom he spoke only to confirm his name and age, before sitting quietly in the glass-walled dock as Montgomery spoke.

She said that the government's allegation that Mallya had deliberately misled banks by overstating Kingfisher's projected profits was ""a false premise"".

That was because airlines were subject to many unpredictable factors beyond their control, such as fuel cost fluctuations and the global economic climate, so to make entirely accurate projections several years in advance was unrealistic.

The judge, England's Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, will have to decide whether there is a prima facie case against Mallya and whether the alleged crimes would be offences in Britain as well as India.","Prison Conditions In India Worse Than In Russia, Vijay Mallya's Lawyer Tells Court",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/12/06/prison-conditions-in-india-worse-than-in-russia-vijay-mallyas-lawyer-tells-court_a_23298458/

(I blame the creepily ambiguous image of a kiss attached to the story.) It turns out “Cat Person” fascinated people for something else: the uncomfortable, unflinching realness with which it depicts a murky, troubling sexual encounter between a young woman and a man she recently began dating.

Fiction? No, fiction isn’t on the list of things to go viral. At least until this weekend, when The New Yorker dropped “Cat Person” by Kristen Roupenian on the internet and sauntered away like an action star silhouetted in front of an explosion. What happened? Why did “Cat Person” catch fire while so many other great New Yorker stories have, comparatively, fizzled?

In fact, “Cat Person” specifically tapped into a need that those xoJane personal essays also fulfilled: honest, vulnerable narration of women’s real-life experience. So much about women’s lives and bodies is framed as shameful, embarrassing. We’re taught to hide our periods, fake orgasms and say yes to a date so as not to hurt a guy’s feelings. How liberating it can be to share what we’re hiding with each other and find out that other women aren’t clean, kind, gentle paragons ― they’re complicated, shallow, misguided and sometimes gross, just like us.

The ubiquity of these essays, in a slightly earlier Internet Age, owed a great deal to the economic considerations of web media, as they require no reporting or expertise and yet tap into the reptilian click-and-share node of our brains. Though The New Yorker’s Jia Tolentino bid farewell to the form earlier this year , it will never entirely leave us. We will always be interested in how other people find love, break up, find balls of cat hair in their vaginas. (Sorry, that happened.)

For one thing, it reads quite similarly to another viral-friendly form: the first-person confessional essay, as propagated by outlets like xoJane and Jezebel. Plenty of Twitter readers, rather tellingly, referred to it as an article or an essay, rather than a short story. “Cat Person” unfolds in a sort of transparent prose that’s not demonstratively artful; it’s easy to lose oneself in, and to get wrapped up in Margot’s neuroses and imagined realities, much as one focuses on the psychological revelations in a New York Times Modern Love column rather than the structure or the use of adjectives. Roupenian’s story is the fiction version of “It Happened to Me: I Had Bad Sex Because It Felt Awkward to Say No.”

To people who frequent certain neighborhoods of Twitter (Book Twitter, but also Feminism Twitter and Media Twitter), the story seemed to be everywhere, along with that unsettling image. Nor was its ubiquity an illusion. “Of all the fiction we published this year, ‘Cat Person’ was by far the most-read online,” Natalie Raabe, the magazine’s director of communications, told HuffPost. “It’s also one of our most-read pieces overall for the year.”

The fortuitous timing, by the way, was no accident. “We had [the story] in hand for a few weeks, and yes, the subject is topical,” Treisman said, “so we felt it would be a good time. We didn’t want to hold on to it for months.”

“This particular story doesn’t concern sexual abuse or harassment, it doesn’t concern workplace abuse or rape, but it does take a look at people’s inability to read each other, inability to read each other sexually,” New Yorker fiction editor Deborah Treisman told HuffPost in a phone conversation on Monday.

The story hit at just the right moment ― amid the #MeToo reckoning , as our society has been consumed by questions of sexual discomfort, misconduct and the toxic state of our scripts around male-female interactions.

Roupenian’s story, if you haven’t read it, is about a college student named Margot who starts texting with Robert, a man who frequents the artsy movie theater where she works. Eventually the two go on a date; it goes rather poorly, but she still ends up back at his place. Once there, her sexual desire for him starts to fade, but she decides she’d rather have sex with him than face an awkward and involved conversation about why she doesn’t want to anymore. She has the sex she doesn’t want to have, she leaves and she stops texting with Robert ― who, spoiler alert, does not handle the rejection gracefully.

I don't really know how to do justice to the conversation that is happening around my story but I am grateful for it. I need to go take a walk in the snow and hug my dog, but if you have messaged me directly, thank you, and in the meantime: https://t.co/IjVFkzWGi6

That “Cat Person” dove deep into a young woman’s consciousness, narrating the female side of a messy, disappointing sexual encounter between a man and a woman, struck many readers as refreshing. (That the young woman was a college student, and her experience a familiar one to the predominantly white, well-educated, financially well-off women who likely make up much of The New Yorker’s readership, could only have helped the story strike a nerve among the target audience.) There’s a wealth of short fiction by men, about men’s desultory sexual doings. Then again, there’s also plenty of great short fiction by women, about women having sex and relationships ― Lorrie Moore and Mary Gaitskill are just a couple of classic examples.

But unlike so many other excellent short stories about dating, sex and female interiority, Roupenian’s story ― her first for The New Yorker ― hit at a moment when we were all primed and ready to talk about it. The specific timeliness of the #MeToo moment combined with the other appeals of “Cat Person” to create an alchemical appeal.

“I’m sure [the response] does have something to do with the nature of our discourse right now, about sex, about consent,” said Treisman. “Those kinds of issues are so much in the news and in the air right now that this was a way to look at them, somewhat away from the political sphere, and the sphere of Hollywood producers and so on.”

Though, as she points out, women having these experiences is not new, it can’t be denied that we’re talking about all of those experiences, past and present, with particular avidity now. It’s as if we all signed up for a seminar on women’s bad sexual experiences with men and we’re halfway through the semester; the early foundational reading has been completed, and now we’re all on the same page. That doesn’t mean we all agree ― on the contrary, “Cat Person” Twitter was pretty divided on even questions so basic as whether Robert or Margot deserved more sympathy ― but we all recognize this story as a clear opportunity to talk about consent, communication and women’s sexual pleasure. If the same story came out six months ago, it would have been the same story, but there wouldn’t have been the same shared understanding of its resonance.

Sad as it might be to admit, a big part of the viral success of “Cat Person” might be, simply, that a work of short fiction has never really gone viral on social media before. Early on, the online conversation surrounding it was a meta-conversation: Isn’t it cool that a short story is getting read? Why is this short story getting read? Is everyone so excited because they’ve never read a short story before and don’t realize how great they can be? How can we get more short stories to go viral in the future? No post-”Cat Person” story will enjoy quite the same novelty.

Treisman, for her part, seemed as surprised as anyone by the story’s burst of popularity ― and she couldn’t put her finger on how to replicate it with future works of fiction. “In terms of the way that word spreads through social media,” she said, “that’s still something of a novelty to me at least. I’m not sure how to game it.”

But we’ve been here before and had these same conversations ― about poetry. When Patricia Lockwood’s “Rape Joke” blew up in the summer of 2013 (tellingly, it also drew in readers with its vivid, uncensored representation of a woman’s interior experience of an interaction with a man), many were flabbergasted that a poem could go viral. The Guardian credited the poem with having “casually reawakened a generation’s interest in poetry.” In the years since, poetry has only continued to strengthen its new readership, particularly online. Nowadays, a poem going viral isn’t all that noteworthy ― it happens often enough. Poetry has become a staple in how we respond to and process events on the Internet, providing a different angle on the world we live in than can a think piece or a breaking news item.

Why can’t short fiction be like that? There are artistic purists who leap to defend the sanctity of literature from such crass things as “messages” or “political relevance.” Any discussion of which character was in the right, or who behaved selfishly or whether the story fat-shamed Robert is framed as improperly treating fiction as nonfiction. “It’s inevitable that some readers view ‘Cat Person’ as weighing in on a timely issue and offering up lessons, the way personal essays are so often inclined to do,” sighed Laura Miller in Slate. “It’s easy to get into the habit of thinking that every imaginative literary work must be made to carry an unambiguous moral.”

But there’s a reason people read the story that way: It’s offering a very realistic narrative of a communication breakdown between two real-seeming people, teasing out the ways in which things went wrong. Of course we’ll want to take lessons from that, if we can. “Cat Person,” though written well before the #MeToo moment and worth reading outside of it, does offer particular relief and insight to readers in the grip of this cultural moment, just as an essay might. Roupenian and Treisman, who both emphasized the story’s ability to speak to our current consternation over dysfunctional male-female communication, seem to be embracing the political relevance of the work.

In an interview with Treisman for The New Yorker, Roupenian explained that Margot’s resignation to sex she no longer wanted “speaks to the way that many women, especially young women, move through the world: not making people angry, taking responsibility for other people’s emotions, working extremely hard to keep everyone around them happy.” In an interview with The New York Times this week, she elaborated on the loneliness women who date men might feel, having a partner, at this moment in time, who doesn’t understand their feelings of sexual vulnerability. “That’s a pain a lot of women I know have felt acutely, especially in this past year, when all of these terrible shared experiences are becoming part of the public conversation,” Roupenian said. “Women try to talk about these experiences with their partners, and they find themselves failing. It’s an isolating feeling for both people involved.”

And while we should certainly remember the story is fiction (no, Margot and Roupenian are not the same person) and can analyze the story as a carefully crafted imaginative work, it’s hard to see what’s wrong with also discussing it as a window into a real-world problem, as Roupenian does in these interviews. That’s exactly what makes it so appealing, and what has long been one of fiction’s strengths ― especially psychological realism.

That’s not to say that fiction should trade in simplistic moral archetypes. As Miller points out, “Cat Person” resists easy judgments of its characters and instead shows two complex, flawed people. That makes it all the more valuable of a teaching tool. Real life, too, is messy and peopled by complex, flawed humans, but real life is where we have to live.",Why A New Yorker Short Story About Bad Sex Went Viral,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-yorker-cat-person-short-story_us_5a2f0389e4b01598ac475cfb

Though, as she points out, women having these experiences is not new, it can’t be denied that we’re talking about all of those experiences, past and present, with particular avidity now. It’s as if we all signed up for a seminar on women’s bad sexual experiences with men and we’re halfway through the semester; the early foundational reading has been completed, and now we’re all on the same page. That doesn’t mean we all agree ― on the contrary, “Cat Person” Twitter was pretty divided on even questions so basic as whether Robert or Margot deserved more sympathy ― but we all recognize this story as a clear opportunity to talk about consent, communication and women’s sexual pleasure. If the same story came out six months ago, it would have been the same story, but there wouldn’t have been the same shared understanding of its resonance.

Sad as it might be to admit, a big part of the viral success of “Cat Person” might be, simply, that a work of short fiction has never really gone viral on social media before. Early on, the online conversation surrounding it was a meta-conversation: Isn’t it cool that a short story is getting read? Why is this short story getting read? Is everyone so excited because they’ve never read a short story before and don’t realize how great they can be? How can we get more short stories to go viral in the future? No post-”Cat Person” story will enjoy quite the same novelty.

Treisman, for her part, seemed as surprised as anyone by the story’s burst of popularity ― and she couldn’t put her finger on how to replicate it with future works of fiction. “In terms of the way that word spreads through social media,” she said, “that’s still something of a novelty to me at least. I’m not sure how to game it.”

But we’ve been here before and had these same conversations ― about poetry. When Patricia Lockwood’s “Rape Joke” blew up in the summer of 2013 (tellingly, it also drew in readers with its vivid, uncensored representation of a woman’s interior experience of an interaction with a man), many were flabbergasted that a poem could go viral. The Guardian credited the poem with having “casually reawakened a generation’s interest in poetry.” In the years since, poetry has only continued to strengthen its new readership, particularly online. Nowadays, a poem going viral isn’t all that noteworthy ― it happens often enough. Poetry has become a staple in how we respond to and process events on the Internet, providing a different angle on the world we live in than can a think piece or a breaking news item.

Why can’t short fiction be like that? There are artistic purists who leap to defend the sanctity of literature from such crass things as “messages” or “political relevance.” Any discussion of which character was in the right, or who behaved selfishly or whether the story fat-shamed Robert is framed as improperly treating fiction as nonfiction. “It’s inevitable that some readers view ‘Cat Person’ as weighing in on a timely issue and offering up lessons, the way personal essays are so often inclined to do,” sighed Laura Miller in Slate. “It’s easy to get into the habit of thinking that every imaginative literary work must be made to carry an unambiguous moral.”

But there’s a reason people read the story that way: It’s offering a very realistic narrative of a communication breakdown between two real-seeming people, teasing out the ways in which things went wrong. Of course we’ll want to take lessons from that, if we can. “Cat Person,” though written well before the #MeToo moment and worth reading outside of it, does offer particular relief and insight to readers in the grip of this cultural moment, just as an essay might. Roupenian and Treisman, who both emphasized the story’s ability to speak to our current consternation over dysfunctional male-female communication, seem to be embracing the political relevance of the work.

In an interview with Treisman for The New Yorker, Roupenian explained that Margot’s resignation to sex she no longer wanted “speaks to the way that many women, especially young women, move through the world: not making people angry, taking responsibility for other people’s emotions, working extremely hard to keep everyone around them happy.” In an interview with The New York Times this week, she elaborated on the loneliness women who date men might feel, having a partner, at this moment in time, who doesn’t understand their feelings of sexual vulnerability. “That’s a pain a lot of women I know have felt acutely, especially in this past year, when all of these terrible shared experiences are becoming part of the public conversation,” Roupenian said. “Women try to talk about these experiences with their partners, and they find themselves failing. It’s an isolating feeling for both people involved.”

And while we should certainly remember the story is fiction (no, Margot and Roupenian are not the same person) and can analyze the story as a carefully crafted imaginative work, it’s hard to see what’s wrong with also discussing it as a window into a real-world problem, as Roupenian does in these interviews. That’s exactly what makes it so appealing, and what has long been one of fiction’s strengths ― especially psychological realism.

That’s not to say that fiction should trade in simplistic moral archetypes. As Miller points out, “Cat Person” resists easy judgments of its characters and instead shows two complex, flawed people. That makes it all the more valuable of a teaching tool. Real life, too, is messy and peopled by complex, flawed humans, but real life is where we have to live.",Why A New Yorker Short Story About Bad Sex Went Viral,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-yorker-cat-person-short-story_us_5a2f0389e4b01598ac475cfb

After dropping off my friend, my van driver would often stop the vehicle somewhere relatively isolated and demand to be kissed.
Sexual abuse of minors in educational institutions is as real a possibility as a child tripping while running unsupervised in the playground or getting into a fistfight.
But when it comes to sexual abuse of children, schools still struggle to come to terms with the issue, leave alone formulating a foolproof plan to fight it.
We have to give back our schools to our children, let's start by asking the right questions.","Till about a few years ago, conversations around child sexual abuse at average Indian homes were inevitably doused in staggering amounts of disbelief. The eyes-widening, jaw-dropping kind I saw on my mother's face as she narrated with great consternation why many years ago, my junior school 'van kaku (uncle)' was abruptly asked to leave.

Roughly a decade and half after the incident first left her puzzled, many years and attempts of us trying to have conversations about sexual abuse without resorting to confusing euphemisms, disbelief was still the main emotion when she recounted why a school van driver, trusted by the family to ferry me to and back from my school, was sacked.

I have no memory of the incident, but she said I had once made an 'odd' demand of not wanting to take the same van to school. The 'van' was effectively a rickshaw, which I took with another girl, and was driven by a local man. After dropping off my friend, my van driver would often stop the vehicle somewhere relatively isolated and demand to be kissed. He also refused to budge from the spot and take me home till I obliged. My mother added that I told her I never hugged him or kissed him because he constantly chewed tobacco and spat on the road. Nevertheless, the driver kept making the same demands every day, and I kept getting off his van which didn't have locked doors and tried wandering away.

So he had to bring me back. The driver was let go and perhaps warned against working in the neighbourhood again. Following months of a family member escorting me to school, I was enrolled for the school bus service — a decision based on the understanding that the safe space that school was meant to be, was by default extended to the bus that transported us. Fortunately for me, the helper and the driver of the bus were the kindest, most responsible people I knew for the eight years I took the bus. However, not everyone had such luck. Three years back, there were allegations that a school bus driver and helper in GD Birla Centre for Education, Kolkata, had molested a first standard student inside the bus.

So when the same school found itself in the eye of a child sexual assault allegation recently again, I really hoped the intervening years and the access to information they offered, had taught us to ask the right questions, respond in a way that leaves no window for such incidents to occur in not just this school, but any school for that matter.

I often can't help thinking that the idea of what was 'safe' when I was a student at the school was completely built on trust, and not active, logical vigilance. My parents, like many others, acted on what traditional wisdom deigned 'safe' – an expensive private school, a school bus, a man known to them for years to ferry a private van.

In all fairness, in pre-internet, pre-GPS and pre-mobile phone days, there wasn't much apart from their gut feeling that they could to fall back upon anyway. And the idea that children, as young as a nursery student, could be the subject of perverse sexual interest clearly didn't occur to them. The predators, however, were no less in number then, than they are now – every second person I know of my age have narrated incidents of being abused and sexually harassed as a child.

While the accused in the GD Birla case have been arrested and demands to arrest Manjushree Khaitan, the head of the governing body which runs several schools in the city, have picked up steam, social media pages for school alumnus and particularly my timeline have raised an alarming number of 'issues' that, unfortunately, are far removed from the reality of child safety.

As a society we are still incapable of having a coherent conversation about incidents of abuse faced by children.

The nature of these conversations are particularly disheartening because not only are they compromising the scope of having a practical discussion about the best possible way we can compel schools to become accountable for the safety of children, but they are evidence that as a society we are still incapable of having a coherent conversation about incidents of abuse faced by children.

The first wave of reaction that surfaced, the moment the incident hit the headlines, was an exasperated chorus of former students and general observers wondering what business the school had hiring male teachers when the students were predominantly girls. There is hardly anything more myopic than concluding that the best way to make a school safe for girl children would be to not have any male staff.

In a country where patriarchal conditioning jeopardises possibilities of having healthy, guiltless interaction between millions of men and women every minute, a modern, progressive school shouldn't act as a space which encourages children to treat the opposite sex with anxiety, confusion and fear. That apart, in a space where children are quite literally coached to take on a world where human interaction is mostly not mediated by a third responsible party, creating a world without men would be essentially false and counter-productive.

By demanding that a school have no male teacher, one only helps schools take the easy way around actually making their institutions sensitive, alert and evolved.

By demanding that a school have no male teacher, one only helps schools take the easy way around actually making their institutions sensitive, alert and evolved. It is the schools' responsibility to not only take help of available technology and be vigilant, but also sensitise the staff about sexual crimes – a prickly subject even today for most conservative institutions.

Sexual abuse of minors in educational institutions is as real a possibility as a child tripping while running unsupervised in the playground or getting into a fistfight. My mother has been a school teacher for over two decades and the latter are possibilities that schools give serious thoughts while planning everything from a school trip to where the students should be during breaks between classes. But when it comes to sexual abuse of children, schools still struggle to come to terms with the issue, leave alone formulating a foolproof plan to fight it.

Apart from fatuous and unhelpful online petitions demanding death penalty for the accused or comments demanding a callous principal be physically accosted, several alumnus and observers have started petitions demanding the school be shut down immediately or its affiliation cancelled. The shut-down-the-school-to-prevent-assault demand is uncannily similar to the stay-at-home-if-you-don't-want-to-get-raped solution often foisted on women.

Even if we leave aside how that would endanger the future of hundreds of students who'd be left in the lurch mid-term, this demand again excuses schools from making any real effort to be vigilant about the safety of their students. Since it is practically impossible that parents of over 1000 students will agree to the shutting down of a school overnight, suggestions such as these will only divide the people who can hold the school accountable.

Finally, as alumnus, survivors of abuse in other spaces and bystanders, we should demand that schools manage to frame a practical tutorial and empower students to feel safe and reassured enough to report threatening behaviour from the staff to a concerned authority. For example, like very young students learn that they cannot just open their lunchbox in the middle of a lesson and start eating, teachers can make them understand that under any given circumstance a staff member shouldn't be leading them to an isolated spot in the school.

My colleague, mother to a four-year-old son, emphatically says that though her son is has been made aware of good touch-bad touch, dangers lurking in familiar spaces, a child as young as that is capable of exercising just limited caution and distrust. ""He'd probably walk into a loo (lured by someone) thinking there maybe a surprise inside,"" she says.

As educators, schools will then have to formulate a language and rhetoric that helps a child see such overtures as inappropriate, and yet not feel intimidated by the idea of school itself.

As children, we saw our school as the place where we built life-long bonds of friendship and trust. It's a place our nostalgia as adults draws from in moments of solitude. It's tragic when a child's trust in her school is broken because the adults entrusted to keep her safe failed in their duty. It's criminal.

And on Sunday night, the AMC show sadly delivered. “Walking Dead” fans, we may have heard our last “Cooooorrraallll!!!”

In the latest episode, “How It’s Gotta Be,” there was all kinds of “Walking Dead” pandemonium. Here’s the episode in a nutshell: The Saviors unleashed devastation. They escaped their previously threatened headquarters, the Sanctuary; took Ezekiel (Khary Payton) prisoner after attacking the Kingdom; and captured Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and her Hilltop crew. And then Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) himself blew Alexandria to smithereens. However, the worst of the worst happened during the closing moments of the episode. As a group of Alexandria’s survivors sat in the sewers, Carl (Chandler Riggs) revealed to Rick (Andrew Lincoln) that he is dying from a zombie bite. Fans couldn’t handle it.

#TheWalkingDead that was so heartbreaking no wonder carl wrote letters and didnt care if he died :( — Jen☆ (@_icicles_) December 11, 2017

Carl told Rick that the zombie bite occurred when the younger Grimes was helping Season 8 newcomer Siddiq (Avi Nash), but his explanation was a little vague. (It seems most likely that the chomp took place in Season 8, Episode 6, “The King, the Widow, and Rick,” when Carl and Siddiq were killing zombies in the woods.) Carl hasn’t officially died as a result of the bite, but it seems like there’s no way out for him now. ”[That bite] is a one-way ticket,” showrunner Scott Gimple said during “Talking Dead” on Sunday. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday, Riggs put the nail in his character’s coffin. “Thank you to all the fans for giving me a job for eight years and for giving me this amazing experience,” he said, “and blessing me with this career and this chance at having so much opportunity.”

Of course, Carl’s death has been somewhat suspected since actor Riggs, who’s played the character since 2010, announced that he was accepted to college in November 2016.

ayy i just got accepted into auburn — chandler riggs (@chandlerriggs) November 7, 2016

In addition to the announcement, Comicbook.com reported that Riggs’ father posted and deleted a long Facebook message, which sounded like a farewell to the show. Here’s what he reportedly posted: 7 year contract completed! Grateful to AMC, Cast & Crew, TWD fan base, and especially Chandler for always being 100% dedicated. Whether is was getting up at 4 AM, working in the freezing cold past 2 AM, leaving his friends and carefree kiddom behind, scrambling to make up missed schoolwork, he has done it without complaint and always made me proud & amazed to be his dad!” In October’s Season 8 premiere, viewers also got a taste of a time-jump scene involving Rick Grimes, aka Carl’s dad, looking teary-eyed ― similar to how he looked following the deaths of Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and Glenn (Steven Yeun). In the scene, Rick repeated a phrase a stranger (who we later learn is Siddiq) said to Carl earlier in the episode: “May my mercy prevail over my wrath.” Moreover, in the Season 8 premiere, a Savior blatantly told Rick, “Your boy’s gonna die.” The foreshadowing was there.

AMC

Following the Season 8 premiere, we asked executive producer David Alpert about the prediction. “I think we’ve shown time and time again that everybody’s on the table,” he told HuffPost, “and that we’re the type of show [where] we don’t have a problem deviating from what the comic does.” Despite all the hints, the moment was shocking. If fans thought anyone in the “Walking Dead” universe was safe, it was probably Carl. “Walking Dead” creator Robert Kirkman called Carl his favorite character during a Reddit AMA, and the now-doomed character has a lot of storyline left from the comics that we might not see play out on screen. Ultimately, Carl’s death is the show’s single-greatest deviation from the comics thus far, and could produce an enormous ripple effect. “The things that we see in the next episode are so important to [Carl’s] life and other characters lives,” Gimple teased during “Talking Dead.” We’ll see it all play out when “The Walking Dead” returns in 2018.

The breach included the names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers related to accounts of people around the world, the company said. About 600,000 Uber drivers also had their names and driver’s license numbers stolen. More sensitive information, including trip location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth, was not accessed.

More troubling than the hack itself: Instead of disclosing the breach to the affected customers and proper government authorities, Uber decided to pay the unnamed hackers to keep quiet.

Most states have laws requiring that companies notify consumers who are affected by a data breach. Although not all require customers to be notified in a specific timeframe, many mandate that it happen as soon as possible. For example, in California, where Uber is based, the disclosure must happen in “the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.”

There’s currently no evidence that the leaked data has been used for nefarious purposes, Uber told customers Tuesday.

“We do not believe any individual rider needs to take any action,” the company said in a statement. “We have seen no evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident. We are monitoring the affected accounts and have flagged them for additional fraud protection.”

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined the company in September, addressed the breach in a blog Tuesday.

“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Khosrowshahi wrote. “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes. We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers.”

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association recognized “This Is Us” in three major Golden Globe Award categories on Monday: Stars Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz received nominations for Best Actor in a Drama and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, and the show has a shot at being named Best Drama Series. This isn’t just a celebratory moment for NBC; it’s big for network television in general. “This Is Us” could become the first network drama to be honored as Best Drama Series since “Grey’s Anatomy” won the Golden Globe in 2007. The other shows in the category this year are premium-cable and streaming standouts like “The Crown,” “Game of Thrones,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Stranger Things.” And compared to the other series nominated for best drama, “This Is Us” makes a particularly strong case for the power of feel-good TV. The show manages to rake in between 10 million to 13 million weekly viewers as it follows the Pearson family, all the while addressing race, gender, age, body positivity and addiction. “I appreciate the conversations that the show starts,” Milo Ventimiglia, one of the show’s stars, told HuffPost earlier this month while promoting a partnership with The Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards. “I appreciate the humanity that it gives all of us to understand that, oftentimes, if we just put our best foot forward, if we try to listen, if we try to understand and be compassionate of the differences that we have as people, the gap isn’t so wide,” he said.

We’ve seen Ventimiglia’s character, Jack, struggle with alcohol abuse. Kate (Metz) has dealt with guilt over a miscarriage, and Randall (Brown) has confronted his anxiety. We’ve seen Kevin (Justin Hartley) face the pressures of fame and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) grapple with the complex issue of raising a black son in America. All of these storylines reflect on specific aspects of the real world we live in, but are wrapped up in a sheen of heartwarming family dynamics. “I’m grateful that people tune in to feel something,” Ventimiglia said. “It isn’t just entertainment. It’s a need to feel that there is good out there and that through the pain or struggle or anything, you can overcome and you can bond together with your closest of kin or friends and move forward in life.” “It’s interesting,” he added. “People say, ‘God, your show makes me cry.’ But I say, ‘Yeah, but you don’t feel bad, do you?’” Ventimiglia said the show simultaneously gives viewers the opportunity to escape the noise of their own lives and offers the drama of high-stakes stories. And “This Is Us” favors a nuanced approach to talking about serious issues, rather than presenting in-your-face commentary. Ventimiglia, a longtime actor who has starred in “Gilmore Girls” and “Heroes,” said he could relate on some level to the experiences of his character’s son, Kevin. In one episode, viewers watch as Kevin’s high school celebrates him as a notable alumnus with Hollywood success. But the fanfare only exacerbates his substance abuse, and the mid-season finale ends with a DUI incident involving Kevin’s niece, Tess (Eris Baker). Although Ventimiglia has never been in that kind of predicament, he’s aware of how the limelight can affect someone’s personal and professional life. “I’m in those shoes at times too, where people applaud you and herald you and you could probably get away with the worst behavior ― yet they’ll still hold you up high. It’s kind of a terrifying prospect,” Ventimiglia said. “I think that if you embrace those bad things in life, then you’re going to turn into the bad examples some of us have seen quite recently. But if you keep on the good path and just be a good person in a position of influence, well, then you’re going to represent a better way to be and a better human being and hopefully that’s what we can inspire: goodness and kindness toward everyone.”

Life is already hard enough. Why would we want to make it more difficult by calling out a difference as opposed to embracing it? Milo Ventimiglia

Another poignant storyline this season has centered on the relationship between Jack and Randall. Despite their physical differences, Jack relates, in some ways, more to his adopted son than his own biological children. “If we as people are constantly going to be stuck on our differences, how are we ever going to understand that we’re all sharing this planet together? Life is already hard enough. Why would we want to make it more difficult by calling out a difference as opposed to embracing it?” Ventimiglia asked. “How I was raised was to see beyond race and gender and anything else, and see the human being behind the person that’s standing in front of you.” The California native credits his parents for giving him a solid support system in his own life and allowing him to grow into who he is today. “My mom and dad were just … they’re the greatest people,” he said. “They’re kind and they armed my sisters and I with everything that we would need for a successful life. And they let us exist, they let us live our lives. So that was always a good thing to know, that I have a foundation to have a good life.” No doubt Ventimiglia is leading a pretty good life these days. The success of “This Is Us” even earned him an Emmy nomination (which co-star Brown went on to win). Ventimiglia doesn’t take any of this for granted, and he said he hopes the show accomplishes more than winning awards. “The level of conversation and what it represents to bring people together, not only as an actor but just as a human being, I’m deeply grateful for.” “This Is Us” returns Jan. 2 at 9 p.m. on NBC.

Over half of Americans are on some kind of prescription medication. A study of 10 years’ worth of medical and health policy, published in JAMA last year, found that the U.S. spent $858 per capita on drugs in 2013, more than twice that of other industrialized countries.

It gets even bigger when you consider all the intermediaries – the FDA, Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs), insurance companies, physicians – between you and the pharmaceutical company that affect what you pay for a given drug. Mergers are common in the industry and occasionally get blocked by anti-trust legislation, as in Aetna insurance’s failed attempt to buy up fellow-insurer Humana Inc earlier in 2017. Now, Aetna is about to be swallowed up in one of the largest health care acquisitions ever, in a move that befuddles those in an already-chaotic industry.

Aetna insures more the 46 million people in the U.S. – myself included. It, like many insurance companies in 2017, restricts benefits to certain providers and only covers prescriptions filled through certain pharmacies. CVS pharmacies, a PBM which claims to serve 5 million customers every day, just bought Aetna in a merger for $69 billion.

News | CVS Health to Acquire Aetna; Combination to Provide Consumers with a Better Experience, Reduced Costs and Improved Access to Health Care Experts in Homes and Communities Across the Country https://t.co/owUz7E117t — CVS Health (@CVSHealth) December 3, 2017

Which leaves me and many other customers wondering: How is it legal for the company that sells me my meds to own the company that is supposed to help me afford them?

Supposedly, a combined insurer and PBM will actually be more powerful in negotiating prices down from pharmaceutical companies – but a PBM can simply pocket these savings and has little incentive to pass them down to consumers. Clearly not a conflict of interest.

This announcement comes just a few weeks after President Trump designated Alex Azar, former U.S.-division president of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, his pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services. You know, the position which oversees the FDA, which in turn regulates the pharmaceutical industry? Again, absolutely no conflict of interest here.

You could argue that as a former pharmaceutical tycoon, Azar knows better than anyone else the ins and outs of the industry. I can’t deny his expertise, but I’m skeptical of his dedication to consumers.

Eli Lilly is actually one of three pharmaceutical companies charged in a January class action suit for price-fixing insulin at hundreds of dollars per vial. Oh, and January is the same month Azar stepped down as president of the U.S. division of the company.

Insulin is one of those drugs that, if you’re a type-1 diabetic, you will die without. Many people have.

If you haven’t heard the name Shane Patrick Boyle, you’ve probably heard of the man who died because his GoFundMe was $50 short of the $750 he needed for his next month of insulin. Boyle had moved to take care of his dying mother, lacked insurance or a job and was waiting for his ACA application to be approved. He died from the diabetic ketoacidosis he developed from trying to make what insulin he had lost longer than it could.

Boyle’s GoFundMe garnered him much more press than most victims of the pharmaceutical industry, but his story has yet to appear in most major newspapers. Most stories of life-and-death struggles with pharmaceutical prices go untold, but there are plenty of them; 2012 research from the ADA suggests that there are 2 million adults under 65 who suffer from diabetes and are uninsured.

As pretty much anyone who has received medical care knows, drugs aren’t the only treatments that are overpriced. Many hospitals mark-up service costs by as much as 1,000 percent, according to a 2015 study published in Health Affairs. The burden of these mark-ups falls disproportionately upon the uninsured, those forced to use out-of-network providers, and insurers like worker’s comp who are required to provide full compensation.

I realize I’ve just thrown a lot of numbers at you, but I wish I had more. One reason it is so difficult to regulate the pharmaceutical industry is a lack of transparency – there is almost no published data tracking actual R&D costs and pricing decisions for drugs. This is, in part, due to the fact that drug prices are often based on what is sustainable and profitable in a given drug market, not the actual costs of development.

Maybe the CVS-Aetna merger will turn out to be a sheep in wolves’ clothing, but I have about as much faith in CVS passing on negotiated savings to consumers as I have in Comcast’s pledge to provide equitable access if net neutrality gets killed. Corporations, especially those in extremely lucrative industries, have been proven again and again to act in their own self-interest up to and sometimes beyond the limits of the law.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> has plans to drop off packages directly into shoppers’ homes.

The world’s largest online retailer on Wednesday announced Amazon Key, a lock and camera system that users control remotely to let delivery associates slip goods into their houses. Customers can create temporary passcodes for friends and other services professionals to enter as well.

The move, in the works for more than a year, may help Amazon capture sales from shoppers who could not make it home to receive an order in person, and did not want the package stolen from their doorstep. It also signals Amazon’s ambitions in the growing market for home security devices, where Alphabet Inc’s <GOOGL.O> Nest Labs competes.

“This is not an experiment for us,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon vice president of delivery technology, in an interview. “This is a core part of the Amazon shopping experience from this point forward.”

Members of Amazon’s Prime shopping club can pay $249.99 and up for a cloud-controlled camera and lock that the company offers to install. Delivery associates are told to ring a doorbell or knock when they arrive at someone’s house. If no one greets them, they press ‘unlock’ in a mobile app, and Amazon checks its systems in an instant to make sure the right associate and package are present.

The camera then streams video to the customer who remotely can watch the in-home delivery take place. The associate cannot proceed with other trips until the home is again locked.

It is unclear if such protections will persuade customers that the service is safe to use.

Larsen said theft was “not something that happens in practice,” based on early tests of the Amazon Key program.

He added that if a problem arises, “You can call customer service, file a claim and Amazon will work with you to make sure it’s right,” reimbursing customers in some cases.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, Amazon’s biggest retail rival, has similar plans. It said last month it would test delivering grocery items “straight into your fridge” with August Home, a smart lock business that Assa Abloy AB <ASSAb.ST> said it will acquire.

JK Rowling, one of the internet's sanest voices, a writer who has consistently been a vociferous champion of women's rights and social equality, recently broke her silence on a controversy that has shadowed her for a while now – the casting of Johnny Depp as Grindelwald in Warner Brothers' Fantastic Beasts series.

For those not in the know, in 2016, Depp's personal life took a tumultuous turn as his then wife, actress Amber Heard, accused him of physically and verbally abusing her during the course of their nearly 4-year-long relationship. In May 2016, she filed for divorce, even providing photographic evidence of physical assault, after Depp struck her face with a cellphone.

Heard's friend, iO Tillet Wright, who witnessed the violence first-hand, in an essay for Refinery 29, wrote, 'The reports of violence started with a kick on a private plane, then it was shoves and the occasional punch, until finally, in December, she (Heard) described an all-out assault and she woke up with her pillow covered in blood. I know this because I went to their house. I saw the pillow with my own eyes. I saw the busted lip and the clumps of hair on the floor.""

In her sworn court declaration, Heard stated, ""Johnny has a long-held and widely-acknowledged public and private history of drug and alcohol abuse. He has a short fuse. He is often paranoid and his temper is extremely scary for me as it has proven many times to be physically dangerous and/or life-threatening to me.""

The Los Angeles judge hearing the case found the evidence compelling enough to grant Heard a restraining order against Depp.

After their divorce, Heard and Depp issued a statement, which Heard re-posted after Rowling' wrote her defense of Depp.

After Heard's claims dominated the news cycle, Potter fans expressed genuine concern about the casting of Depp in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Rowling, until now, had maintained a stoic silence on the matter even as her Twitter feed was cluttered with fans expressing a desire to get him removed. Rowling never said a word. In fact, when one Twitter user, @hobbitlindsey, questioned Depp's participation in the movies and Rowling's silence on the controversy, she was blocked by the author, a rather uncharacteristic move.

JK ROWLING BLOCKED ME pic.twitter.com/UaTkeqAMsW — Lindsey (@hobbitlindsey) November 29, 2017

As someone who has never shied away from engaging politically (she was a vocal critic of Brexit and routinely calls out Trump) or shaming sexist trolls, haters, bigots, xenophobes, and body-shamers, Rowling's meek defense of Depp is uniquely disappointing, convenient and inconsistent with her fiercely liberal and progressive worldview.

Here's Rowling's complete statement:

JK Rowling's statement on Johnny Depp's inclusion in the Fantastic Beasts series.

As we've seen, in a post-Weinstein era, there's a significantly higher consciousness of the effects and implications of male violence and sexual abuse. At least in the entertainment industry, (Al Franken may have grudgingly resigned but don't forget accused paedophile Roy Moore is still running for Senate and Donald Trump is still the President of the United States), there's a legitimate reckoning as more and more women come forward to share stories of abuse and an increasing number of powerful men face very real consequences for their past actions.

In that context, Rowling's statement, where she asserts that she's 'not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies' is a massive setback for what feels like a legitimate and much-needed revolution. When she says, she's 'genuinely happy' with her choice, she has chosen to disbelieve a woman who suffered violently at Depp's hands. When she selectively quotes Heard on having expressed a desire to 'move on,' she's consciously ignoring the part where Heard wrote that 'neither party made false accusations.'

It's one thing to call out perpetuators of abuse when there's nothing personally at stake, but quite another when there are serious financial as well as social ramifications.

It's one thing to call out perpetuators of abuse when there's nothing personally at stake, but quite another when there are serious financial as well as social ramifications. The women who came forward to share their stories risked all of that, and much more, and Rowling's support of Depp belittles their courage and insidiously stifles their collective voices.

It also delegitimizes their struggle.

Rowling, in the past, has made her position clear on Weinstein, although not directly.

On 11 October, she quote tweeted a tweet from Trump's Former Deputy Assistant, Sebastian Gorka, where he said, 'THINK: If Weinstein had obeyed @VP Pence's rules for meeting with the opposite sex, none of those poor women would ever have been abused.'

(Pence's rules for meeting with women is to never do it alone)

Rowling responded to it, saying, ""If the only thing preventing a man committing sexual assault is the presence of witnesses, he's too dangerous to be at liberty.""

But calling out a sexual predator when there are no real financial or legal consequence to you is far easier than calling out an abuser, whose inclusion or exclusion, directly affects your economic advancement.

Times such as these are the true test of how far you can go to defend your ideals and more importantly, how consistent your actions are with your projected ideals. A moral dilemma such as the one Rowling faced -- to choose between perceived commercial gains or take an ethical stand -- reveals if she believes in championing causes or it's mere lip-service/a PR exercise.

Today, Rowling is in a position of power, where she can influence the decision of a mammoth studio to get Depp dropped and replaced with another, a more credible A-lister – if that's one of the reasons to continue having him in the film. By doing so, she could've set perhaps the most solid example, after Kevin Spacey's firing from one of Netflix's top-performing show, House of Cards, and emboldened the efforts of several hundred women who still fear calling out their aggressors for the fear of sabotaging their careers.

And if Netflix can act, why can't Warner Bros? And it's not just Netflix, it's a whole lot of corporate giants who're part of the awakening.

In an unprecedented move, Sony allowed Ridley Scott to reshoot the Kevin Spacey-starrer All The Money in the World after the film was fully complete. NBC fired top-ratings drawer, Today show host Matt Lauer, Amazon dropped its studio head, Roy Price. HBO has cut all ties with Louis CK. (Here's a list of at least 40 men who've lost their jobs/resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct came about).

Why should Depp be absolved of his transgressions and continue to be recruited in top projects? Especially when the degree of his transgressions is much severe, the timing of the event recent, and the the evidence, overwhelmingly clear?

We need men to lose.

We need men to realise that there are consequences, economic, social, legal and otherwise. Society doesn't owe these men rehabilitation, that's their and their battle alone. And what it definitely doesn't need to do -- like Rowling's decision quite actively has -- is to enable their economic advancement and contribute in refurbishing their image by consciously glossing over their very serious moral and potentially legal offenses.

Now, more than ever before, we need this reckoning to continue. To win. To validate the difficult truths of all those women who suppressed traumatic memories with unimaginable courage and risked re-traumatization by choosing to open up.

And Rowling, along with us, let them down too.

It's deeply wounding to be disappointed by somebody you've idolized. It not only saddens you, it thwarts your little reservoir of idealism. It's disenchanting when your heroes leave you with a profound sense of betrayal. But perhaps we need to shift our idea of what constitutes a hero, just like we have of what definitely doesn't constitute one.

A hero cannot be a projected version of our collective fantasies, who we, as hopeful followers and worshippers of literature and cinema, put on a pedestal they never signed up to be put on.

A hero cannot be an armchair hashtag activist.

A hero has to be one who champions causes, uses all the tools available to them to enable social change, and calls out a bully, a harasser, a predator, even if it comes at a commercial disadvantage.

For a writer who made an incredible career by authoring a story about a boy who survived abuse, it's heartbreaking to see Rowling defend a man, who, in all likelihood, perpetuated it.

For all its magic, the Harry Potter universe, primarily, is built on the premise of standing up to bullies.

Sadly, it's author today is complicit in encouraging one.

As the great wizard Dumbledore once said, ""Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.""

For now, we know the choice Rowling made. It's a choice she'll have to live with.

He was so sure she would be coming to London he ordered a “Welcome Home” banner off Amazon. On Tuesday, he received the rejection. He said it left him “in shock”. He was sure it was a mistake in processing their application and defining his income to assess whether he earned the £18,600 Britons must if they want to bring a spouse from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). On Wednesday, he picked up the keys to the Kilburn flat they were due to rent together. “As a husband, I am broken,” he wrote that day in his blog.

But, Ahmad said that the Jammu & Kashmir government needs to address some pressing issues, which are hurting the beekeeping industry in Kashmir.","By Athar Parvaiz*, Bandipora, Jammu & Kashmir

Towseefa Rizwi, a woman entrepreneur in the Shalhar village of Bandipora district in north Kashmir, compares herself with the women working in the government sector, and finds one big difference: ""I am independent."" Rizwi is the owner of Kashmir Valley Agro Industry (KVAI) where her husband Parvez works as production manager.

She mainly deals in honey, which she processes and packages at her own plant in the village. ""I always had the desire of starting my own business. And I am thankful to honey bees for making me realize my dream,"" Rizwi told VillageSquare.in with a big smile on her face.

Kashmir Valley, with huge resources available, especially vast tracts of horticultural land, has a great potential for beekeeping and exporting honey to different Indian states. This has prompted the agriculture department of Kashmir to promote beekeeping in the region. Horticultural farmers who took to beekeeping are reaping rewards for their efforts. Apiary business has also given rise to successful processing units.

Viable business

According to Rizwi, the entire area has been known for keeping at least one or two beehives which are mostly traditional Kashmiri beehives. ""I thought why can't we do it on a big scale? And one day I told my husband that we will set up our own honey processing plant,"" she said. ""So we applied for a loan and set up the plant which has a capacity of processing up to three tons of honey per day."" She has been doing this business for 10 years now.

Rizwi refused to share the details about the annual revenue, but she said that she is making a respectable income from the honey business. ""We manage the affairs of our family and the education of our kids with the income from the honey business,"" she said.

Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, a beekeeper in Rizwi's village said that he decided to keep bees after he saw Rizwi doing well in her beekeeping business. ""I got five bee colonies from the government at subsidized rate in 2015 which have now increased to 20,"" Bhat told VillageSquare.in. ""Though I lost a few of them to harsh weather in April this year, I feel I am getting a lot of financial benefit. For example, I got a profit of Rs 20,000 this year.""

Bees provide sustenance

For Zamrooda Khan, a woman entrepreneur in downtown Srinagar, defeating the greatest challenges of life would not have been easy if her bees had not kept her busy. Draped in a black shawl with her head covered in a scarf, she cuts a striking figure. Miseries and melancholic moments in her life have failed to shake her resolve for living a dignified life. Khan has not only fought the battle against breast cancer successfully following her divorce, but has also turned herself into a small entrepreneur.

Khan realized that her job at a private school was fetching her too measly an amount and was not enough for meeting her expenses. This, she says, made her think about additional income to shore up her earnings from the school.

""Since my father used to be a successful beekeeper of his times and I had learnt many things from him about beekeeping, I wasted no time and started a small apiary,"" Khan told VillageSquare.in. She started her business, Busy Bee Honey Apiary, after receiving further training from the agriculture department in 2003. ""This job suited me, for it kept me busy and that too with the nature's gifted beings called honey bees.""

For her, it is not a business, but a small enterprise for feeding her daughter and son, besides getting medicines for her. She produces around 100 kg of honey from her beehives every season, which fetches her sustenance. ""But I certainly want to expand this venture by setting up a processing plant in future. I have passion for this profession,"" Khan said.

Migrating to beat the weather

""I am strongly interested in increasing the number of my bee colonies. If I have more colonies, I can think of migrating them out of Kashmir during winter. Those who have at least a truck-load of bee colonies, hire trucks in winters and migrate the colonies to warm areas that have more crops,"" Bhat told VillageSquare.in. Most beekeepers of Kashmir shift their beehives to Jammu, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra in winters.

In the Gulgam village of northern Kupwara district, more than 12 villagers, who earn their livelihoods from beekeeping, have migrated their beehives to Rajasthan and Gujarat. ""Shifting the hives out of Kashmir during winter makes a lot of economic sense to us. It gives us an extra crop and keeps the bees healthy as well,"" Mohammad Yaseen, a beekeeper of Gulgam village, who has 140 beehives, told VillageSquare.in.

Potential and challenges

""We are now promoting honey bees as agents of pollination which will not only result in increasing crop productivity, but will also increase honey production. The idea is also to generate employment through this sector by value addition,"" Farooq Ahmad Shah, chief technical officer at Kashmir's Department of Agriculture, told VillageSquare.in.

Presently, the industry is confronted with the threat of Varroa disease caused by Varroa mite that feeds on larvae and adult bees. During the past two-and-half decades, this disease has destroyed Apis cerana, the honeybee, which has traditionally been found in Kashmir, almost entirely and has also caused extensive damage to Apis mellifera, the European honeybee, which was brought to Jammu & Kashmir from Europe.

""The industry suffered a major setback in 1982 when majority of Apis cerana bees were wiped out. Then the industry was revived with the introduction of Apis mellifera. But it also got affected by the disease in 2005-06 resulting in extermination of up to 80 % of the colonies,"" Shah told VillageSquare.in.

However, Shah said, the industry has again made a comeback in recent years with the help of technology and insecticides. According to Shah, presently there are over 35,000 honeybee colonies in Kashmir and the number of registered honey cultivators is 1,484. As per the estimates of agricultural experts, there is a potential for 120,000 colonies in Kashmir considering the huge availability of horticultural land. The Kashmir region has 161,682 ha of land under horticulture and it is increasing every year, as some farmers prefer growing fruits rather than rice.

According to Farooq Ahmad, a former agriculture officer who has published several papers on beekeeping in journals such as The Bee World and Indian Bee Journal, and an orchardist, who has 10 kanals (around half a hectare) of orchard, one should have at least three bee colonies for ensuring a good production. ""So, you can just imagine the potential we have for apiculture considering the availability of thousands of hectares of horticultural land in Kashmir,"" Ahmad told VillageSquare.in.

But, Ahmad said that the Jammu & Kashmir government needs to address some pressing issues, which are hurting the beekeeping industry in Kashmir. ""The most important of these issues is the lack of proper training for beekeepers and the unavailability of preventive and control measures for tackling pests and diseases,"" Ahmad said.

Under the Trump administration, those rights are being reined in to help out employers.

In a memo dated Friday and obtained by HuffPost, the NLRB’s new general counsel, Peter B. Robb, orders board officials around the country to consult his office on cases that involve precedents set on worker rights during the last eight years. The move effectively strips away the discretion of regional board officers to pursue cases against employers based upon Obama-era rulings and policies.

Put simply, the rights that were expanded under Obama are pretty much on hold.

The NLRB is the independent federal agency responsible for refereeing disputes between employers, workers and their unions. The general counsel plays a critical role at the board and functions as a quasi-prosecutor, deciding which major cases to investigate and pursue when workers claim their rights have been violated. Robb was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate on Nov. 8.

Wilma Liebman, a former Democratic chairwoman of the five-member board that rules on those cases, said it is standard for a new general counsel to issue a memo ordering certain cases to be sent to Washington for advice, particularly those involving recent precedents. Robb’s Democratic predecessor issued a similar memo when he came onboard. Still, Liebman said, she was surprised by the “sweeping” breadth of Robb’s memo and the speed with which it was issued after his confirmation.

“The direction is crystal clear,” Liebman said. “There is an agenda: Fewer workers will have fewer rights.”

Many of the precedents Robb cites in his memo involve what’s known as Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Those rights are at the heart of collective bargaining law, guaranteeing workers the ability to band together and engage in “mutual aid and protection.” Through their rulings and legal guidance, the board nominees under Obama took a relatively expansive view of what’s considered legally protected activity by workers.

Robb’s outlook is much more likely to please employers. In his memo, he said he would be rescinding seven “guidance memos” that were crafted by his Democratic predecessors. These are memos that advise board officials on how to interpret and enforce the law. He also said it was mandatory for board officials to seek his office’s advice on matters involving “cases over the last eight years that overruled precedent and involved one or more dissents” by board members.

Some of the precedents cited in his memo infuriated business groups, like the case known as Browning-Ferris. That board ruling made it easier for a big corporation to be deemed a “joint employer” alongside their subcontractors or franchisees. The change has helped workers and unions bring cases against a company like McDonald’s and not just against the individual franchisees who operate McDonald’s restaurants.

Other cases were lesser known but could affect workers around the country who end up in disputes with their employers. One Obama-era case clarified employees’ ability to use their work emails to try to organize a union or talk about working conditions. Another case outlined employees’ ability to record company meetings, including anti-union speeches made by bosses.

It’s common for the labor board to become more friendly to employers than workers after a Republican wins the White House. Until his nomination, Robb was a management-side attorney who represented employers and trade groups. He served as an attorney at the labor board during the early 1980s.

Evan Greer, campaign director at Fight for the Future, told HuffPost via email that the protests aim to “visually show the outrage sweeping the internet, and generate local awareness that pressures members of Congress to do their jobs” and persuade the FCC to hold off on its scheduled Dec. 14 vote on ending net neutrality.

Lawmakers “should exercise their oversight authority and pressure the FCC to cancel the vote,” he said.

“At each protest, participants will carry signs with messages like, ‘Killing net neutrality hurts small businesses,‘” he said. “Participants will also call and tweet at their lawmakers, and in some cities will march to lawmakers’ offices.”

If the FCC votes to kill the rules, public interest groups will fight them in court, and we’ll be demanding that lawmakers act to reverse the decision.”

Initially, small demonstrations were planned in about a dozen cities, “but there has been such a massive outcry” over the FCC’s plan “that now there are more than 600 protests in all 50 states, organized by volunteers who are coming out of the woodwork to engage on this issue,” Greer said.

HuffPost spoke to one of those volunteers, Emma Dill, who helped organize the protest planned at the Verizon store in the Bryant Park area of Manhattan.

“The internet is pretty central to all of our lives. Over the last year, the internet’s played a huge role in helping us stay informed about politics and current events, and, more importantly, enabled organizers to quickly spread info and organize,” she said. “Nationwide events like this would be substantially harder to build if you had to pay to get the message to people who care.”

Dill, a digital product manager, says the protest will be a peaceful gathering and that she hopes “people are made aware of what’s going on.”

“A rollback of net neutrality could have a huge impact on our everyday lives, but thanks to all of the other high-priority issues happening right now it hasn’t gotten a ton of airtime,” she said.

In order to help reduce the burden and confusion of the new nationwide tax on businesses, the government moved most goods which had attracted the highest rate to a band lower.

But cost pressures remained strong in November, and may push inflation to breach the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4 percent.

""Underlying data indicated that the central bank is less likely to adopt an accommodative stance as input cost inflation intensified to the fastest since April,"" said Dodhia.

The Reserve Bank of India is likely to keep interest rates steady at its policy meeting next week, with stronger inflation expectations leaving it little room to ease, a recent Reuters poll of economists showed.",Indian Factories Show Fastest Growth Since Demonetisation In 2016,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/12/01/indian-factories-show-fastest-growth-since-demonetisation-in-2016_a_23294829/

You put all of these things together, and it adds up to a lot of illegal activity flowing through the Airbnb business model.
In other words, when their business model is built on corporate crime.","I am an old-fashioned kind of guy: when I do business with a company, I want to purchase good products and services for a reasonable price. Maybe it’s odd enough in these times, but I don’t want the company I am doing business with to be either cheating me or to be engaged in criminal enterprises. Call me crazy.

When the financial collapse happened, and I started reading the books and articles explaining what had gone down, I was appalled to learn how much the biggest companies in the financial sector were committing crimes as a regular part of their daily business. From the ratings companies giving false Triple A grades on bonds certain to go bust, to falsifying data on home mortgages, to the stunningly widespread practice of robo-signing to the LIBOR rate-rigging scandal, to laundering money for drug cartels to bankers regularly selling their clients investments they knew were bad, to Wells Fargo cheating millions of customers by creating false accounts, it was clear that fraud was literally built into the business model of many of the biggest banks on Wall Street. Big banks have paid over $209 billion dollars in fines for their crimes in recent years, but it doesn’t faze them a bit. They just build the cost of those fines right into their business model.

This was why it was so disappointing to see so few Wall Street execs personally prosecuted. There’s nothing like a few perp walks in corporate board rooms to change the culture of comfortable CEOs used to just paying whatever it takes to make problems disappear.

Lately, I have been working with a coalition of business, labor, fair housing, and disability rights advocates that is concerned about the impact of Airbnb on our communities. And I am starting to think that the Airbnb business model has some of the same crime-built-into-the-business model issues as big banks on Wall Street.

There have been a couple of extremely troubling stories that have popped up recently that reinforce this idea.

This story from the Daily Beast describes a scheme by Russian fraudsters, wherein they utilize Airbnb to launder money from their criminal enterprises. They recruit corrupt hosts who get a cut of the action or set up fake accounts that will facilitate the transactions.

And speaking of Russians, this story follows reports that one of the ways currently indicted Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort laundered money sent by his Russian friends was through an Airbnb-based scam. These stories show there is a mushrooming problem that law enforcement officials are just beginning to deal with, as organized crime, foreign governments, and wealthy tax avoiders start using Airbnb as a way to stash their cash.

Then there is the specter of political and corporate espionage. The Washington Post broke a story that an undercover operative for the right-wing political hitman James O’Keefe rented an Airbnb in a well-known Democratic operative’s basement. The Democrat involved had been a previous target of O’Keefe, so the odds of this being a coincidence are approximately a billion to one. So how many times has Airbnb been used to conduct corporate or political espionage, where agents stay with a targeted host and then search their house or eavesdrop on their conversations? We don’t know, but I would bet this incident was not the first and certainly won’t be the last.

Then there are scary stories like this one. Airbnb says that it carefully screens its hosts, but there are too many of these stories where people with a history of serious and repeated criminal behavior have passed the company’s screen. And there are plenty of stories where the reverse is true, where guests are caught dealing drugs or doing other illegal things out of Airbnb rentals, like this story out of London.

All of this is on top of the fact that the Airbnb business model is increasingly built on professional hosts: apartment buildings that are essentially illegal hotels, operating without health and safety rules or ADA rules; and real estate investors who run multiple listings. I’m not even talking about hosts that run two properties, but there’s a shocking number of hosts with ten or more listings, sometimes even 20, 30, 40 or more properties.

You put all of these things together, and it adds up to a lot of illegal activity flowing through the Airbnb business model. No wonder they keep trying to cut deals with cities to pay a little bit in taxes in exchange for no regulation of any kind on their business practices. To this old Wall Street activist, they are starting to sound too much like a Too-Big-to-Fail bank.

Like banks, Airbnb offers a useful service to society. In the banks’ case, it is lending money, allowing people to save their money, and facilitating the transfer of money. With Airbnb, it’s offering people an easy way to share their homes with travelers and make some extra dough to pay the bills. The problem for these businesses comes when they start making money through fraud. It becomes so lucrative, such a profit-driver, that they can’t turn off the spigot. They buy off regulators, or demand no regulation at all, in order to protect those profits. In other words, when their business model is built on corporate crime.",Corporate Crime Built Into The Business Model,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corporate-crime-built-into-the-business-model_us_5a219f9be4b04dacbc9bd6c1?section=us_business

He said that he would seek atonement, healing, and perhaps redemption, from what he and I hold dear, that’s yoga.
That’s confront their deeds, admit the pain it caused, and spare no effort or expense in embracing the fight to end sexual abuse.
This is why I reached out to him and this is why I will continue to reach out to him.","One week before screenwriter Jenny Lumet gave her very graphic account in the Hollywood Reporter of her allegation that music and TV producer mogul Russell Simmons sexually assaulted her, I had reached out to Simmons. We have the same interest ― no, passion ― in and for yoga. I’ve been a practitioner of it for several years. Simmons has been a virtual one-man crusader for yoga, spreading the gospel of its many physical and metal rejuvenating benefits far and wide. He has opened a popular yoga studio in West Hollywood. My interest was solely in exploring ways to collaborate with him on further promoting yoga as a practice in inner city communities.

But Lumet’s allegations stopped me dead in my tracks. I am hardline on sexual abuse. I have devoted a countless number of my columns over the years to blasting the long-running hideous, self-serving history of duck, dodge, denial and out and out hypocrisy by legions of politicians, artists, entertainers and top dog religious leaders when confronted with their sexual crimes. Their storehouse of lies, armies of enablers, batteries of attorneys, and a largely disinterested, and worse, disbelieving public, have enabled them to skip away scot free with little damage to their professions, careers and standing. Comedian-actor Bill Cosby partially changed that. Harvey Weinstein fully changed that. Men from top to bottom are under the long-awaited, and much needed, media, corporate and legal looking glass.

Russell is no different. The truth of Lumet’s allegation against him is yet to be determined. But what has been determined is that Russell, as with so many high profile, wealthy, connected men, has played fast and loose with the rules of engagement on sex. There were women, lots of women, and the temptation was simply far too great to resist not to abuse, harass and victimize women. They were fair game.

However, this is where Simmons is different and why after an agonizing soul search about him and his alleged act, or acts, I could applaud him. The applause is for his fully taking responsibility. He immediately issued a statement that did not try to sleaze out of the allegation with the usual ploys prominent men use when nailed with a sex charge. One is to turn the table and try to smear the integrity and veracity of his accuser. Another one is to loudly profess their innocence. Another is to do the he said, she said ritual tap dance denial. And yet another is to simply say absolutely nothing.

Simmons in his public statement admitted that sexual abuse is a vicious and pernicious stain in American life, and that women have suffered mightily from the decades of victimization. He admitted that men such as himself may have caused much of that pain. Finally, he publicly declared that he would relinquish involvement and operation of his lucrative business interests. No tears need be shed for him on this. This does not mean that he will reduce himself to sack cloth and ashes. He will still be a very wealthy, powerful and connected man in the entertainment industry.

Finally, he did something that especially caught my eye and heart. He said that he would seek atonement, healing, and perhaps redemption, from what he and I hold dear, that’s yoga. He would do that by converting his studio for yogic science into a non-profit center of learning and healing

Simmons provided a template for other men caught with their sexual misdeeds down. That’s confront their deeds, admit the pain it caused, and spare no effort or expense in embracing the fight to end sexual abuse. Simmons publicly did that.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) made the decision to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee Tuesday.

An IOC report confirmed “the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system in Russia,” the organization said in a statement. The decision follows a 17-month investigation led by former president of Switzerland Samuel Schmid.

Official record books for the Olympics ― which will take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next year ― will permanently show that Russia did not win any medals. However, individual Russian athletes will be able to compete wearing a neutral uniform, The New York Times reports.

Russian athletes who qualify will have to meet “strict conditions,” the IOC said in a release, that include drug testing that could go beyond normal Olympic standards. But the Russian flag will not fly, and the Russian anthem won’t play at the games.

Two top Russian officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, have been banned from Olympic involvement for life, while Russian Olympic Committee President Alexander Zhukov’s IOC membership has been suspended.

The lawyer of Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia’s anti-doping laboratory who peeled back the layers of Russia’s state-run doping program in a 2016 New York Times report, said in a statement Tuesday that the IOC’s decision sent a “powerful message.” Rodchenkov’s story is further explored in the Netflix documentary “Icarus” released earlier this year.

“As the world has seen, Dr. Rodchenkov provided credible and irrefutable evidence of the Russian state-sponsored doping system, which was ultimately supervised and financed by then-Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko and other high-level government officials,” lawyer Jim Walden said in a statement. “The decision to bar Russia’s official participation in the Winter Olympics makes abundantly clear to Russia, and all countries, that there are serious consequences for flouting the rules of the international community.”

And, it is basically a Sufi text that cannot be treated as a source of political history of Mewar.
In this entire controversy, one comes across vandalism by lumpen elements holding state machinery to ransom.","A 21st-century movie based on the mythological-fiction of the 16th century about a 14th-century queen has ruffled political feathers in India. The members of Karni Sena, a politico-cultural group of Rajputs, man-handled Sanjay Leela Bhansali, movie's director, vandalized cinema halls and openly threatened a high-intensity violence if the movie is released. The protesters allege that the movie distorts the Rajput history, glorifies a barbaric invader as a lover and a brave warrior. Rumours are galore that the movie shows a love-affair between the Queen Padmavati and the invader Allaudin Khiljhi.

However, the truth is far more complex than what appears on the surface. Eminent journalists like Dr. Ved Pratap Vedic and Rajat Sharma have stated that the movie has absolutely nothing that is objectionable and insulting to the pride and culture of Rajputs. The fact that the above-mentioned journalists did not find anything objectionable with the movie shows that the ongoing agitation is not just about the alleged distortion of history and restoring the Hindu pride.

The entire saga smacks of ulterior motives which do not appear to be very clean.

The entire saga smacks of ulterior motives which do not appear to be very clean. So far the main agitators like Karni Sena and their leaders have not shown any gesture that shows their intent for any rational dialogue to sort out the issue in the light of evidence. Gujarat government has banned the movie; Yogi Adityanath has condemned the movie and even the Congress-led Punjab government has also banned the movie. It seems there are strong political stakes in the controversy.

Gujarat elections are on and Gujarat has roughly 6% Rajputs. Traditionally, they have been aligned with Congress. BJP for obvious political reasons preferred the Patidar community as they are numerically superior. Off late, because of the Patidar community's angst with BJP over the reservation issue, BJP has been wading in troubled waters which resulted in a major dent in BJP's traditional Patidar vote bank. Further, because of demonetization, the business community is already annoyed with Modi.

After Modi's departure to Delhi, the performance of the state government has been lacklustre. Modi's successor Anandi Ben did not enjoy the same popularity among the state BJP cadre as Modi did. Her handling of the Patel agitation further alienated the Patidars. As a result, she had to be dispensed with and replaced by Vijay Rupani. But the succession was not without frictions and controversies.

Since 2002, in the absence of any major communal riot, it has been difficult to cash upon the communal sentiments of Hindus for electoral gains. No one denies the fact that BJP has been losing ground in Gujarat ever since Modi has assumed the Prime Ministerial mentor. But Modi can't afford to lose Gujarat. It is indeed a prestige point for Modi, being his home state. Further, if BJP wins Gujarat, it will be a big psychological boost confirming the faith of the people in the leadership of the Modi in his home turf.

This psychological boost will be a boon for 2019 national elections. A prominent journalist from Dainik Bhaskar media group told this author that in the Padmavati controversy BJP sees an opportunity to rake up Hindu nationalism and dormant communal sentiments of Gujaratis. This controversy might put to silence disturbing questions on demonetization and job-creation, driving away people's attention from drab economic worries to volatile and passionate concerns of nationalism, Hindutva and a larger objective of regressive course correction in history. Further, in such difficult times if minor appeasement baits to Padmavati protestors swings even a small portion of Rajput votes to BJP, then, politically it could be the deal worth going for.

In such difficult times if minor appeasement baits to Padmavati protestors swings even a small portion of Rajput votes to BJP, then, politically it could be the deal worth going for.

Superficially, the entire drama may look like a display of power by the fanatic fringe of Hindu rightwing. Generally, among the left-of-the-center public intellectuals, the tendency will be to perceive the entire episode as an assertion of fascist Hindu rightwing elements under the allegedly favorable BJP government.

However, the truth might actually be far more complex and nuanced. After Indira Gandhi stopped privy purses, and with the strengthening of the grassroots democracy in India, the Rajput community faced a major decline in their socio-political clout. Their numbers have declined fast in the government services.

This has a led to a feeling of insecurity among them and some shrewd community leaders have been smart enough to cash upon such sentiments to advance their political careers. With these violent protests, they want to show that they have the street power and they can bring the state machinery to its knees. This author feels that this agitation has more to do with caste-based identity politics of Rajputs then with core ideology of Hindutva.

And, one can witness a revisionist tendency and a crude form of cultural assertion among the Rajputs in myriad ways. The young Rajput lad Om Banna has almost acquired a sacred status because of some supernatural stories surrounding his death and now he has become a strong instrument of political mobilization. Recently, over the police encounter of a dreaded criminal Anandpal, a Rajput, the community leaders made a big hue and cry and the matter had turned into a political hot-cake.

Caste Dynamics

One can find amateur historians trying to prove Maharana Pratap's victory over Akbar in Haldighati for petty political interests. Hence, at a deeper level there are very subtle and strong casteist undercurrents but since the Rajputs are Hindus, it becomes easier in the existing jingoistic socio-political milieu, for the Hindutva fringe and their twitter brigades to pile on, for socio-political gains.

But, the intellectuals have to be honest here. A broad-brushing analysis that this is just a fascist Hindutva business is very superficial and smacks of their personal hatred for the ongoing ruling establishment. Any honest and objective inquiry will explore the caste dynamics and dig into the socio-cultural roots of such developments.

Was Padmini a real character or a fictitious character that has acquired a sacred status?

According to the written sources, Padmavati is not mentioned in any of the historical sources of Rajasthan. The character finds its first mention in a text named Padmawat written 250 years after the Khiljhi's Chittor invasion, by a Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi who lived in Faizabad, separated from Mewar by more than 1000 kilometers. And, it is basically a Sufi text that cannot be treated as a source of political history of Mewar.

But then it deserves to be mentioned that Padmini might be a fictitious character but the practice of Jauhar by Rajput females is a historical fact. The Rajput females captured in wars were often ill-treated, their dignity violated and they were either sold in the slave markets of central Asia or confined to Harem of invader kings. In order to escape that humiliation and protect their honor the females often immolated themselves which came to be known as Jauhar.

Distortion Of Historical Facts?

In this entire saga, the main issue that has often been raised is the distortion of historical facts. This issue could have been seen in an objective manner too but most often such issues immediately acquire a saffron color and become a question of Hindu identity. This is so because Hindus feel that Marxist historians in India have maligned their heroes like Sivaji and Maharana Pratap and made heroes out of bigots and murderers like Aurangzeb, Tipu Sultan and Allauddin Khaljhi.

I have myself studied in the elitist bastions of higher education in India and found them to be left-dominated. During the last five to six decades of Congress rule, they got the patronage from the establishment. The left-liberal cluster that is derisively called as 'pseudo-secular' these days, had turned dictatorial and allegedly banished the alternative schools of thoughts from the academia.

In fact, this is one of the reasons why the right-wing forces in India got the popular support. They were successful in spreading the message across the wider sections of the majority community that for petty political reasons minority appeasement has crossed the limits and it would result in wiping out the socio-cultural roots of Hindus.

In this entire controversy, one comes across vandalism by lumpen elements holding state machinery to ransom. Even their baseless arguments and political chicanery get a pass because at deeper levels Hindus feel that their history has been tampered with.

Finally, a democratic and secular state like India cannot allow a group of violent elements to ride roughshod over the constitutional guarantees like freedom of expression.

We are setting a very wrong precedent by allowing such Taliban-styled fringe groups to acquire social legitimacy and a political clout. In a multicultural society like India, such violent extremism has no place if we are to keep our communal harmony intact and sustain ourselves as a vibrant democracy, safeguarding basic human rights.

During a news segment on Tuesday night before the race was called, WGCL-TV journalist Sharon Reed addressed a viewer, Kathy Rae, who sent an email criticizing the anchor’s comments on how race played a role in the election. In the email, Rae called Reed a “N***r,” misspelling the slur. (Readers should be aware that the word also appears uncensored below.)

Conversations surrounding the city’s mayoral race between Democrat Keisha Bottoms and Independent Mary Norwood have been drenched in racial tension . Bottoms, who was announced as the winner Tuesday evening with less than one percentage point of a lead, is black, and Norwood is white.

Reed addressed the email on-air, saying that Rae “mischaracterized” what she said.

“I didn’t say white people couldn’t talk about race. Quite the contrary, we think that race is an authentic discussion to have. It’s one that we’re having tonight because it’s one that you are talking about at home and it’s one that has clearly entered the Atlanta mayor’s race,” she said. “And that’s why, behind the scenes, my colleagues and I, white and black, we decided, hey, let’s go for it. Because we do try to keep it real here and I think we do a very good job of it.”

“So I think when arguing with somebody, you have to be careful not to mischaracterize their viewpoint, so I won’t mischaracterize your view either, Kathy Rae,” she continued. “I get it.

Reed shared the clip on her Facebook page, noting that this isn’t the first time she’s been called the epithet.

The video, shared by Twitter user Billy Michael Honor on Tuesday, received more than 16,000 retweets and 31,000 likes.

Everyone thought it was a formality. It wasn’t. As it was confirmed there was no agreement on the Brexit ‘divorce’ settlement, here’s where everyone stands after a day of high political drama: What is the issue with the Irish border? The Irish border - specifically the border between EU-member Ireland and the British region of Northern Ireland - is proving to be a major obstacle. Protracted talks over its future status is preventing negotiations between the UK government and the EU to start over a future trade agreement. Dublin fears the creation of a ‘hard border’, replacing the existing ‘soft’ arrangement, could disrupt 20 years of delicate peace in Northern Ireland and put the Good Friday Agreement in jeopardy. Some have alluded to the the army checkpoints and watchtowers that dotted the 310-mile border during the Troubles, and Ireland has sought assurances that nothing similar will be revived. However, there has been a stalemate.

Yves Herman / Reuters Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker announce the 'no deal' in Brussels on Monday afternoon

Ireland has called on Theresa May to keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union - essentially a free trade area - in order to avoid the ‘hard’ border. But, as the UK government is at pains to argue, this goes against the principles of Brexit, which it says must include the UK leaving both the customs union and the single market, which permits free movement of goods, people, services and capital. That’s enough of a catch-22 without the Democratic Unionist Party potentially bringing down the minority Conservative government. Why is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) having an influence? The Northern Irish DUP and its 10 MPs in Westminster has been propping up the Tories after signing a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement following May’s disastrous snap General Election. Walking away from the deal is the Northern Irish party’s trump card. Last week, speculation mounted that a deal was being thrashed out to harmonise trading relations in some areas between Northern Ireland and the EU (or, in other words, the Irish republic). The DUP appeared willing play its hand, hinting that any deal to “placate Dublin and the EU” would mean the Conservatives “can’t rely on our vote”. READ: Who Are The DUP? Meet The Northern Irish Political Party Propping Up The Tory Government So how does the UK government satisfy both Northern Ireland and Ireland? With great difficulty. On Monday, a leak of a draft text suggested the UK had agreed that Northern Ireland would maintain ‘regulatory alignment’ with the EU to prevent the need for customs checks at the border. A 15-page joint statement from the European Commission and the UK stated that “in the absence of agreed solutions the UK will ensure that there continues to be continued regulatory alignment” with the internal market and customs union. This is where confusion reigned supreme. As the text was passed around Brussels, London, Dublin and Belfast, debate raged over whether ‘regulatory alignment’ constituted effectively still being an EU member. A former Treasury adviser did not think so:

To save a week of pointless commentary can we all agree that ""regulatory alignment"" in some key areas is not the same as staying in the single market or the customs union? — Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) December 4, 2017

The fact that they are not the same thing is the WHOLE POINT of the wording — Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) December 4, 2017

As press conferences and lunches were arranged and cancelled as reports varied as to whether the DUP and the Irish government had agreed the deal, it was soon clear the unionists would not buy it.

DUP leader Arlene Foster, in robust fashion, told reporters they could not back the proposal. “We will not accept any kind of regulatory divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the UK,” she said. “Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom.” Why is the Irish border dispute blocking wider Brexit negotiations? Meanwhile in Brussels, May was hoping to announce that a deal had been agreed on Northern Ireland, as well as the rights of EU citizens after Brexit and how much the UK is willing to pay as part of the ‘divorce’ bill. So with the DUP effectively nixing the border solution, the UK Prime Minister was left in limbo (May was having lunch during the DUP press statement, and had to break from talks to phone its leader Foster to meet her concerns).

No deal today I’ve just been told #brexit — katya adler (@BBCkatyaadler) December 4, 2017

Standing side-by-side with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, she was forced to admit there was no agreement with Brussels on the entire divorce package. But they remained confident on getting agreement, saying differences remain only on a “couple of issues” - with the Irish question still outstanding. Negotiations over the ‘divorce’ settlement is known as Phase One, and is crucial to pushing on with Brexit. The EU insists Phase One has to be completed before moving on to Phase Two - namely the talks about fresh trading relationships between the UK and Europe. Negotiators are working to a strict timetable, with the hope from the UK side being that Phase One is wrapped up before the December 14 summit of EU leaders. This, in turn, is seen as important to providing enough time for new trading arrangements to be thrashed out by March 29, 2019 - the day the UK official leaves the bloc. Why has a ‘special’ deal for Northern Ireland prompted Scotland, Wales and London to ask for the same? Both Nicola Sturgeon and Sadiq Khan demanded ‘special’ Brexit deals for Scotland and London, arguing there was no reason why other parts of the UK can’t get different treatment if Northern Ireland does. Scotland’s Fist Minister said that if a Brexit deal can be done that “effectively” keeps Northern Ireland in the single European market, there is “surely no good practical reason” why others should not benefit from the same.

If one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market (which is the right solution for Northern Ireland) there is surely no good practical reason why others can’t. — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) December 4, 2017

Both Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain part of the EU in the referendum. The Mayor of London, buoyed by the capital voting by a margin of 59.9 percent to remain within the EU, followed suit:

Huge ramifications for London if Theresa May has conceded that it's possible for part of the UK to remain within the single market & customs union after Brexit. Londoners overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and a similar deal here could protect tens of thousands of jobs. — Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) December 4, 2017

The domino effect continued, with Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones also calling for Wales to be allowed to stay in the single market if other parts of the UK could.

We cannot allow different parts of the UK to be more favourably treated than others. If one part of the UK is granted continued participation in the Single Market & Customs Union, then we fully expect to be made the same offer. — Carwyn Jones (@fmwales) December 4, 2017

Brussels correspondents, however, suggested they might be guilty of political opportunism.

So is Brexit actually going to happen? Despite the many moving parts, Brexit is moving ahead - but at a glacial speed that has led many to question whether it will lead to a decent deal given the multiple compromises already made. A damning editorial in the London Evening Standard, edited by former chancellor George Osborne, pointed to the series of concessions the UK has made since the EU insisted the terms of trade couldn’t be negotiated until the divorce settlement was agreed. It pointed to: - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson telling Europe to “go whistle” if it wanted a generous divorce settlement, only for the UK now being close to agreeing to pay a £50 bn in return for favourable trade talks. - Conceding to all the demands on future status of EU citizens living in the UK, which has included accepting involvement of the European Court of Justice - crossing one of May’s apparent ‘red lines’. - The Irish border, and which Brexiteers “were publicly telling everyone it was a trivial issue which a clever camera could solve”. All that aside, Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders, said today that while time to reach an agreement on divorce terms is “getting very short”, a deal that would unblock talks on a future trade agreement is “still possible” by next week. In short, it’s still on.",What Is Going On With Brexit After 'No Deal' On The EU 'Divorce'?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-going-on-with-brexit-after-no-deal-on-the-eu-divorce_uk_5a2572aae4b03c44072f26e2

Republican politicians speak of economic growth, “saving” Social Security and Medicare, and the need to rein in the deficit.","Republican leaders claim that they are the party of family values. They are not. They also claim that they understand and respect hardworking Americans. They do not.

The Republican elite’s immorality goes well beyond Donald Trump, who has bragged about sexual assault, and has indeed been accused of it by over a dozen women. It goes well beyond Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was banned from a shopping mall to prevent him from preying on minors, and who has been credibly accused of the behavior for which he was banned.

The immorality and disdain of today’s Republican elites shine through in the policies that they embrace. They are embodied in the Republican budget, in their tax legislation, and in their relentless attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those Republican policies benefit the ones they truly value – their super wealthy donors.

Republicans in both chambers of Congress have now passed tax bills, which, when the smoke clears, involve the upward redistribution of income and wealth. As if today’s obscene level of income and wealth inequality weren’t bad enough, Republican elites want to increase it.

Both the Senate and House versions require millions of middle class Americans to pay more, while requiring the richest of the rich to pay less. In 2027, taxpayers with incomes between $40,000 and $50,000 will, as a group, pay $5.3 billion more in taxes, while those with annual incomes of $1 million or more will pay $5.8 billion less!

Moreover, hardworking Americans will be hurt in other ways. The increase in the deficit caused by the tax scam will automatically trigger $400 billion in cuts to Medicare. And even that isn’t enough for the party of immorality.

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) have made it clear what comes next. Rubio recently claimed that we need to change the structure of Medicare and Social Security (code for making huge cuts) because of the deficit. Ryan was even clearer, saying that he is planning to push legislation to “reform” (code for destroy) Medicare and Medicaid because “it’s the health care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt.”

Republicans have made this bankrupt argument for decades, but it is especially audacious of them to do it at the exact same time that they are planning to add at least $1 trillion to the debt to pay for their tax giveaway to the wealthy. The announced plans to go after Medicare and Medicaid, as well as Social Security, are in addition to the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, a linchpin to the workability of the law. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the repeal of that key provision will result in an added 13 million Americans without health care, while millions of others will see their health insurance premiums go up by ten percent or more.

Taking away health care from disabled children and elderly Americans, among many others, in order to give a huge tax handout to billionaires and giant corporations is one of the most immoral policies imaginable. But that’s exactly what the self-proclaimed “moral values party” is proposing to do.

The truth is that Social Security does not add a single penny to the debt. Medicare and Medicaid are far more efficient than their private sector counterparts. Gutting them would make health care costs rise more quickly, not rein them in. It would, however, transfer the costs from the federal government to elderly, impoverished, and disabled Americans who can’t afford them. It would mean the wealthiest among us, who are not paying their fair share now, would pay even less. Like the tax scam, cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will transfer wealth upward.

Why are Republicans so hypocritical about the debt, constantly using it as an excuse to demand cuts to vital benefits while they happily add one trillion dollars or more to it by giving huge tax cuts to the wealthy? Because they never cared about the debt at all. It’s just a convenient bludgeon for them to use in their decades-long war against Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Indeed, they have opposed these programs ever since they came into existence.

That opposition comes from the fundamental immorality at the heart of the Republican Party. It is a political party united around the principle that only the wealthy have any value. It is a party that has disdain for everyone else. A party that believes hardworking Americans doing backbreaking work at less than subsistence wages are lazy freeloaders.

Republican politicians are usually careful enough to not reveal their true attitude publicly during election seasons. But in unguarded moments, they say what they really mean.

In case the policies are too subtle or opaque, their immorality and their contempt for the rest of us have been made completely transparent by recent public comments from Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA.)

Hatch, in a heated exchange with Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), explained why Republicans have failed to renew CHIP, which provides health insurance to poor children. Shockingly, he said: “I have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won’t help themselves, won’t lift a finger and expect the federal government to do everything.”

Social Security and Medicare are benefits that are earned, just like Senator Hatch’s government salary. But his comments had to be referencing their beneficiaries. There is no other way to get to trillions of dollars.

Similarly, Grassley, explaining why the GOP wants to eliminate the estate tax, which only impacts the wealthiest 0.02 percent of Americans, stated: “I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it’s on booze or women or movies.”

Apparently, if working and middle-class Americans didn’t spend money on alcohol, women (who Grassley tellingly refers to as commodities rather than people), or entertainment, they could have $5.49 million to leave to their heirs! And, because Donald Trump has led such a puritanical life, he should be free of paying taxes toward the common good!

Grassley and Hatch’s comments are both woefully out of touch and deeply immoral. But they are not out of step with their party. Ryan frequently talks about “makers and takers.” He has claimed that “we’re going to a majority of takers versus makers in America…They’ll be dependent on the government for their livelihoods [rather] than themselves.”

Ryan insists that Social Security and Medicare, earned benefits that he dismissively calls “safety nets”, are in danger of becoming “a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency,” turning them into slothful and lazy “takers.” More crudely and succinctly, former Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) asserted that Social Security is “a milk cow with 310 million tits [sic]!”

These comments reveal the utter contempt Republican politicians have for hardworking Americans. It is ironic that the Republicans who are pushing to eliminate the estate tax apparently do not consider the heirs of billionaires to be “takers” but save that pejorative label for hardworking Americans who have the audacity to claim the Social Security and Medicare benefits they have earned.

Republican politicians speak of economic growth, “saving” Social Security and Medicare, and the need to rein in the deficit. But the truth is clear to anyone who is willing to really look. Today’s GOP is interested only in doing the bidding of their billionaire donors so that they can retain power. It is a party of politicians who, despite their claim to the contrary, are disdainful of hardworking Americans.

The American people did not vote for this morally bankrupt philosophy. None of the candidates in last year’s election ran on gutting Medicare and Medicaid, denying health care to poor children, or providing a massive tax transfer to billionaires. Republicans never do. Instead, they focus on trumped up scandals, personality, and divisiveness.

But next year, they are likely to find that their tax scam (regardless of if it ultimately becomes law) was a step too far — especially if Ryan acts on his plans to follow it with further attacks on Medicare and Medicaid. Voters will be furious, and they will not be distracted from their anger.

Democrats need to channel that anger by promising to govern in the exact opposite way that Republicans have. They should run hard on a pledge to protect and expand Social Security and Medicare. If they do, voters will know that the Democratic Party is the party of family values; they will know that Democrats are the politicians who respect all Americans, even those that happen not to be wealthy.",The Deeply Immoral Values Of Today’s Republican Leaders,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-deeply-immoral-values-of-todays-republican-leaders_us_5a2eb9f7e4b04cb297c2aee5?section=us_politics

The Irish border - specifically the border between EU-member Ireland and the British region of Northern Ireland - is proving to be a major obstacle. Protracted talks over its future status is preventing negotiations between the UK government and the EU to start over a future trade agreement. Dublin fears the creation of a ‘hard border’, replacing the existing ‘soft’ arrangement, could disrupt 20 years of delicate peace in Northern Ireland and put the Good Friday Agreement in jeopardy. Some have alluded to the the army checkpoints and watchtowers that dotted the 310-mile border during the Troubles, and Ireland has sought assurances that nothing similar will be revived. However, there has been a stalemate.

Yves Herman / Reuters Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker announce the 'no deal' in Brussels on Monday afternoon

Ireland has called on Theresa May to keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union - essentially a free trade area - in order to avoid the ‘hard’ border. But, as the UK government is at pains to argue, this goes against the principles of Brexit, which it says must include the UK leaving both the customs union and the single market, which permits free movement of goods, people, services and capital. That’s enough of a catch-22 without the Democratic Unionist Party potentially bringing down the minority Conservative government. Why is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) having an influence? The Northern Irish DUP and its 10 MPs in Westminster has been propping up the Tories after signing a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement following May’s disastrous snap General Election. Walking away from the deal is the Northern Irish party’s trump card. Last week, speculation mounted that a deal was being thrashed out to harmonise trading relations in some areas between Northern Ireland and the EU (or, in other words, the Irish republic). The DUP appeared willing play its hand, hinting that any deal to “placate Dublin and the EU” would mean the Conservatives “can’t rely on our vote”. READ: Who Are The DUP? Meet The Northern Irish Political Party Propping Up The Tory Government So how does the UK government satisfy both Northern Ireland and Ireland? With great difficulty. On Monday, a leak of a draft text suggested the UK had agreed that Northern Ireland would maintain ‘regulatory alignment’ with the EU to prevent the need for customs checks at the border. A 15-page joint statement from the European Commission and the UK stated that “in the absence of agreed solutions the UK will ensure that there continues to be continued regulatory alignment” with the internal market and customs union. This is where confusion reigned supreme. As the text was passed around Brussels, London, Dublin and Belfast, debate raged over whether ‘regulatory alignment’ constituted effectively still being an EU member. A former Treasury adviser did not think so:

To save a week of pointless commentary can we all agree that ""regulatory alignment"" in some key areas is not the same as staying in the single market or the customs union? — Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) December 4, 2017

The fact that they are not the same thing is the WHOLE POINT of the wording — Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) December 4, 2017

As press conferences and lunches were arranged and cancelled as reports varied as to whether the DUP and the Irish government had agreed the deal, it was soon clear the unionists would not buy it.

DUP leader Arlene Foster, in robust fashion, told reporters they could not back the proposal. “We will not accept any kind of regulatory divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the UK,” she said. “Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom.” Why is the Irish border dispute blocking wider Brexit negotiations? Meanwhile in Brussels, May was hoping to announce that a deal had been agreed on Northern Ireland, as well as the rights of EU citizens after Brexit and how much the UK is willing to pay as part of the ‘divorce’ bill. So with the DUP effectively nixing the border solution, the UK Prime Minister was left in limbo (May was having lunch during the DUP press statement, and had to break from talks to phone its leader Foster to meet her concerns).

Standing side-by-side with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, she was forced to admit there was no agreement with Brussels on the entire divorce package. But they remained confident on getting agreement, saying differences remain only on a “couple of issues” - with the Irish question still outstanding. Negotiations over the ‘divorce’ settlement is known as Phase One, and is crucial to pushing on with Brexit. The EU insists Phase One has to be completed before moving on to Phase Two - namely the talks about fresh trading relationships between the UK and Europe. Negotiators are working to a strict timetable, with the hope from the UK side being that Phase One is wrapped up before the December 14 summit of EU leaders. This, in turn, is seen as important to providing enough time for new trading arrangements to be thrashed out by March 29, 2019 - the day the UK official leaves the bloc. Why has a ‘special’ deal for Northern Ireland prompted Scotland, Wales and London to ask for the same? Both Nicola Sturgeon and Sadiq Khan demanded ‘special’ Brexit deals for Scotland and London, arguing there was no reason why other parts of the UK can’t get different treatment if Northern Ireland does. Scotland’s Fist Minister said that if a Brexit deal can be done that “effectively” keeps Northern Ireland in the single European market, there is “surely no good practical reason” why others should not benefit from the same.

If one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market (which is the right solution for Northern Ireland) there is surely no good practical reason why others can’t. — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) December 4, 2017

Both Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain part of the EU in the referendum. The Mayor of London, buoyed by the capital voting by a margin of 59.9 percent to remain within the EU, followed suit:

Huge ramifications for London if Theresa May has conceded that it's possible for part of the UK to remain within the single market & customs union after Brexit. Londoners overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and a similar deal here could protect tens of thousands of jobs. — Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) December 4, 2017

The domino effect continued, with Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones also calling for Wales to be allowed to stay in the single market if other parts of the UK could.

We cannot allow different parts of the UK to be more favourably treated than others. If one part of the UK is granted continued participation in the Single Market & Customs Union, then we fully expect to be made the same offer. — Carwyn Jones (@fmwales) December 4, 2017

Brussels correspondents, however, suggested they might be guilty of political opportunism.

She hasn’t

So is Brexit actually going to happen? Despite the many moving parts, Brexit is moving ahead - but at a glacial speed that has led many to question whether it will lead to a decent deal given the multiple compromises already made. A damning editorial in the London Evening Standard, edited by former chancellor George Osborne, pointed to the series of concessions the UK has made since the EU insisted the terms of trade couldn’t be negotiated until the divorce settlement was agreed. It pointed to: - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson telling Europe to “go whistle” if it wanted a generous divorce settlement, only for the UK now being close to agreeing to pay a £50 bn in return for favourable trade talks. - Conceding to all the demands on future status of EU citizens living in the UK, which has included accepting involvement of the European Court of Justice - crossing one of May’s apparent ‘red lines’. - The Irish border, and which Brexiteers “were publicly telling everyone it was a trivial issue which a clever camera could solve”. All that aside, Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders, said today that while time to reach an agreement on divorce terms is “getting very short”, a deal that would unblock talks on a future trade agreement is “still possible” by next week. In short, it’s still on.",What Is Going On With Brexit After 'No Deal' On The EU 'Divorce'?,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/12/04/what-is-going-on-with-brexit-after-no-deal-on-the-eu-divorce_a_23297061/

Word is Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Republican Ajit Pai, will hold a vote next month on reversing the landmark 2015 net neutrality order that bars corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and Time Warner Cable from blocking or slowing internet content.

We should be loud and clear in the coming weeks like we've been before: net neutrality is crucial to helping everyone, regardless of where they live or how much money they make, get online.

But there’s another way we can fight for an open internet.

Last week, 19 towns across Colorado voted to allow the exploration of creating a local, public alternative to expensive private providers.

Fort Collins voters went the furthest, passing a measure to finance an assessment of starting a city-owned broadband utility, which would aim to provide faster service at a cheaper price. That means residents could have a say in whether a new public network maintains the principle of net neutrality, whatever the FCC decides in the future.

“People who don’t normally get excited or vote actually turned out this time and actually got energized,” said one resident who had campaigned for the measure.

Not everyone was excited. Industry groups spent more than $450,000 campaigning against the measure. In fact, the very reason Colorado towns had to vote “yes” before even exploring public broadband is because of an industry-backed state law requiring municipalities to jump through hoops to take control of their internet infrastructure. (The industry has successfully pushed similar legislation in over 20 states.)

Comcast and the like are quaking in their boots about a public option, and they should be. Cities like Chattanooga, Tennessee, which became the first U.S. city to offer gigabit internet speed after going public, are outperforming private providers and even forcing them to innovate to play catch up.

Why shouldn’t internet access be a public good? The web should be like the Postal Service, which, because it’s public, provides affordable mail service to everyone, rich or poor, in all areas of the country.

And why should a handful of corporate executives and investors get rich while providing expensive, slow access and unbearable customer service?

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called on the British government on Wednesday to make a formal apology for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in which nearly 400 Sikhs were shot dead by British Indian army soldiers.

During a visit to the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism, Khan called the massacre one of the most horrific events in Indian history.

On Sunday 13 April 1919, some 50 soldiers began shooting at unarmed civilians who were taking part in a peaceful protest against oppressive laws enforced in the Punjab by British colonial authorities.

At least 379 Sikhs were killed, but the figure is still disputed.

""It is wrong that successive British governments have fallen short of delivering a formal apology to the families of those who were killed,"" he said.

""I'm clear that the government should now apologize, especially as we reach the centenary of the massacre. This is about properly acknowledging what happened here and giving the people of Amritsar and India the closure they need through a formal apology.""

Khan, who is from the opposition Labour Party, does not speak for Britain's Conservative government.

Former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron visited Amritsar at the end of a trade mission to India four years ago in a show of contrition over the massacre but stopped short of making a formal apology.

Khan is on a six-day mission to India and Pakistan to strengthen cultural and economic ties with the British capital.

The British Foreign Office said in a statement: ""As the former Prime Minister said when he visited the Jallianwala Bagh in 2013, the massacre was a deeply shameful act in British history and one that we should never forget.

""It is right that we pay respect to those who lost their lives and remember what happened. The British Government rightly condemned the events at the time.""",London Mayor Sadiq Khan Calls For UK Apology Over Jallianwala Bagh Massacre,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/12/06/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-calls-for-uk-apology-over-jallianwala-bagh-massacre_a_23299721/

Other industry sectors also covering treatment for this disease include Finance and Investment Banking, Consumer Products and Retail, Fashion, Luxury and Apparel, Media, Consulting and Audit, and Pharmaceuticals.

A just released report from FertilityIQ shows the improved landscape of employers offering a fertility benefit – from new entrants, including non-profit organizations, to major enhancements of benefits previously offered including coverage for up to 4 IVF cycles and no dollar limits. In Tech Companies Get High Marks for Covering Infertility Treatments, the New York Times describes the wide variation of coverage found in the new report including requirements for diagnosis, pre-authorization and dollar limits. Further, interviews with tech companies reveal the clear competition among tech firms to offer very generous fertility benefits. For a list of the 250 companies with the most generous IVF coverage in 2017-2018, click here.

With a strong economy, employees often have more choice about where to work and employers who want to attract and keep the best employees need to offer up-to-date, in demand benefits. Those employers offering fertility benefits often reap the benefit of strong employee loyalty which drives meaningful improvements in employee retention, ultimately helping to reduce employer costs. Interviews with employees also suggest enhanced productivity as access to needed treatment means less worry about a major issue, improving their ability to focus on work. The bottom line is a likely return on investment for employers that provide coverage for infertility care.

Employees do have strong, positive feelings when their employers offer coverage for infertility treatment, according to Barbara Collura, President and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association who presented survey findings at the recent American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) annual conference. RESOLVE partnered with ARC Fertility and EMD Serono to survey 702 employees who had at least one egg retrieval. Of those surveyed, 57% had health insurance covering some diagnostic and/or infertility treatment.

The survey found that employees have a higher rate of satisfaction with their employer if fertility benefits are offered compared to employers who do not offer a benefit:

· 4 times more believe their employer is meeting the needs of today’s families

· 2.5 times more believe their employer listens to their needs

· 1.5 times more believe their employer cares about their well-being

Comments from survey respondents also revealed stark differences in how employees felt about their employers based on whether or not they offered a fertility benefit. One woman stated that because her employer offered such coverage “I’m loyal – it’s the reason I stay.” Those employers who did not offer coverage earned negative comments from employees including: “behind the times in health coverage,” “makes me feel undervalued,” “discriminated against this disease,” and “must be a better place to work, I’m looking for a better job with better benefits, better understanding.”

Whether an employer offers coverage for fertility treatment also has enormous financial implications for those who seek IVF treatment. FertilityIQ describes the current trend of infertility coverage as one of “haves” vs. “have nots” with 80% of all of today’s patients either having all or none of their IVF care paid for by their employers, with most being in the “have not” category. Given the average U.S. household annually earns $51,000 in pre-tax income and the cost of IVF treatment – with multiple cycles – averages approximately $23,000 (including medication and consultation), fertility coverage makes a real and life-changing difference for those who need treatment but could not otherwise afford it.

There is help available for employees who want to talk to their employer about adding a fertility benefit. The RESOLVE Coverage at Work Initiative includes a template letter to use with a company’s HR Department or benefits manager. Among other things, the letter cites studies showing the actual minimal costs related to adding coverage, and the improved health outcomes which also lower employer expenses.

The tiny Madarangajodi village of Keonjhar district in Odisha, surrounded by hills and a few cultivable farmlands, has been in the news for the last few months. The village is known as village of widows. The men working in a nearby mining factory died in a span of two years, leaving more than 50 widows struggling to eke out a living and fight for their rights alone.

The men died of silicosis, a fatal disease that affects the lungs, while working in the pyrophillite grinding unit of the factory. Since 2007 the widows have been fighting against the Jharkhand-based mining company for compensation. In July 2017, the labor court of Keonjhar awarded a compensation of Rs 46 lakh to 16 families of the deceased employees of the now-defunct factory near Madarangajodi.

But the 16 families who heaved a sigh of relief find their hopes fading as the Jharkhand-based mining company plans to challenge the order of the Keonjhar labor court.

New jobs and hopes

It was in 1982 the Jharkhand-based company got rights for mining pyrophyllite over 53.8 ha near Madarangajodi village, about 20 km from Keonjhar town, the headquarters of Keonjhar district. Men from Madarangajodi and nine surrounding villages started working in the mining company, which was engaged in production of lime and sandstone.

""Before joining the mining factory, the men were either working as agriculture laborers or migrating to other places to work in construction sites. It was very difficult to meet the basic needs of the family,"" Gangadhar Dehuri, now 50 and one of the few survivors, told VillageSquare.in. ""When the mining company got lease and opened its unit we all dreamed of a better life.""

Before joining the mining factory, the men were either working as agriculture laborers or migrating to other places to work in construction sites.

The villagers thought that the jobs in the factory would eradicate poverty, they could feed and clothe their families and save some money for their future. Not only did the company pay very low wages but also regular inhalation of the dust — pyrophillite was being ground to a powder — pushed them into another difficulty.

Hidden occupational hazard

Sixty-year-old Padmabati Barik's husband was the first to develop breathing problem and succumb. ""Even after washing and cleaning with soap many times, there was a white layer all over the body. Some persons developed skin disease,"" she told VillageSquare.in, showing the white powder she had preserved. ""Imagine how it would affect if it was inhaled."" Some are believed to have complained of it being expelled through excreta.

""We didn't know this white powder would be so fatal. I witnessed my brothers and other men suffer from breathing problem at an early age and succumb to death,"" said Gangadhar. ""I worked in the loading department and not in the grinding unit, so I survived.""

Sarojini Khuntia lost her husband in 2006. He was only 28. But according to her, he had been suffering from silicosis since 2001. Explaining her husband's sufferings, she said, ""Initially he developed breathing problem. Due to poverty and lack of money we avoided going to the hospital. Later when it became worse, we went to a nearby health center."" The doctor referred him to Keonjhar district hospital.

""I worked in the loading department and not in the grinding unit, so I survived.""

At the district hospital Sarojini's husband was diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis and was given medicines accordingly. ""But when things did not change I took him to SCB (SCB Medical College and Hospital) in Cuttack,"" Sarojini told VillageSquare.in. The doctors informed that he suffered from silicosis, a fatal disease of the lungs caused by constant inhalation of crystalline silica.

During 25 years of the factory's operation, the men continued to work, unaware of the danger of silicosis. The toll was the highest in Madarangajodi. Most of the men who died suffering from silicosis were between 18 and 30 years of age. ""The situation was dangerous because every alternate month one or two persons would die. There are women who were widowed at the age of 19 and 20 left with children who were just a few months old,"" said Sabitri Barik a widow, wiping tears in her veil.

Even after they were diagnosed with silicosis the men continued to work in the mining factory. When they were unable to walk properly, the wives accompanied them to the worksite. ""Because the family depended on the weekly wages of the laborers even though the amount was meager. It was a support to feed the family and the treatment,"" Sunafula Khuntia, a widow, told VillageSquare.in.

Spurned by employees

For her husband's treatment, Sarojini spent nearly Rs 3 lakh, but the company did not provide any financial support during the treatment or after his death.

When the situation worsened and the men died one after the other, the women went to the company official, seeking compensation. ""We asked the company owner to give us compensation as the 50-odd men in these villages lost their lives to occupational hazards while working in the mining company,"" said Sarojini. ""But he said the laborers might have died due to liquor or other reasons, though we had medical reports that mentioned silicosis as the cause of death.""

After many men died, the widows gathered at the worksite and asked the company for compensation. When the company owner did not heed to their demands, they fought to close the factory down. ""When my husband died, our second child was then only six months old. We didn't want our children to work in the same factory and die of silicosis,"" Anjana Khuntia, one of the youngest widows, told VillageSquare.in. The factory closed down its operations in 2008.

After many men died, the widows gathered at the worksite and asked the company for compensation.

Reacting to allegations of lack of precautions by workers, Sarojini said that the men wore masks but that was not sufficient to stop the inhalation of the deadly silica. ""One can say that the factory violated the safety rules by not providing safety gear to the employees and not conducting regular health check-ups,"" Niladri Mishra, a longtime environmental activist in the mining areas of Keonjhar, told VillageSquare.in.

Official recourse

But the women's fight against the company for compensation did not stop. ""We discussed with many lawyers in the district to file a case against the company. But the company lured them with money,"" said Sarojini. ""We are poor people. Where will we get lawyers to fight for us?""

To sustain their families and the fight for compensation, the women went through many hardships. For their fight against the company, some sold their ornaments, while others borrowed money from moneylenders by mortgaging their house or farmland.

Though the villagers said 50-odd male members died of silicosis, the labor department attributed only 29 deaths to silicosis.

A social activist of Keonjhar moved the National Human Rights Commission that directed the Keonjhar district administration to carry out an investigation. The officials who visited the village in 2013 found merit in the complaint. Though the villagers said 50-odd male members died of silicosis, the labor department attributed only 29 deaths to silicosis.

""Many have been left out of the list because they couldn't provide necessary documents for proof of age, employment proof and medical report,"" Kainfula Mahakud told VillageSqaure.in. ""When my husband worked in the factory and died of silicosis, why should my family be denied compensation?""

Persisting with hope

It is nine years since the pyrophyllite mining company has been closed and the widows are left to fend for themselves. The company or the state government has provided no compensation, except a monthly pension of Rs 1,000. A visit to Madarangajodi and surrounding villages indicate how other issues like child labor, child trafficking, denial of education to girl children and early marriage plague the lives of the villagers living in extreme poverty.

""A case of employee compensation was registered at the assistant labor commission's court. After the probe the court decided that only 16 beneficiaries will be provided with a compensation of Rs 46 lakh,"" Laxmidhar Rout, Assistant Labor Commissioner, told VillageSquare.in. ""But there is a possibility of the company owner moving a higher court.""

If that happens, justice to these women will again get delayed. But the women are willing to fight for their rights till the end. ""We will not give up our struggle for compensation,"" declared the women. ""Because we have seen how painful their suffering was, during the last days of their lives,"" said Sarojini, adding a reason to their resolve.

WASHINGTON ― When explaining how he would (somewhat) extricate himself from his myriad conflicts of interest this week, President-elect Donald Trump and his tax lawyer completely ignored what would happen to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. It looks like he also failed to discuss that with the government agency that holds the hotel lease. Trump’s deal with the General Services Administration to operate a hotel in the Old Post Office building specifically states that the lease cannot be held by an elected official. And the clock is ticking down to Trump’s inauguration. Yet the GSA released a statement on Wednesday, after the president-elect’s press conference, indicating that it was not aware of his plans for the Trump Organization until he announced them to the public.

This is a legitimate international scandal and they’re not part of the conversation. Procurement law expert Steve Schooner, on the GSA

“GSA understands that an announcement has been made to change the business structure of the Trump Organization,” the agency said in a statement. “We are seeking additional information that explains and describes any new organizational structure as it applies to the Old Post Office lease. Upon receipt, consistent with our treatment of any contract to which we are a party, we will review this new organizational structure and determine its compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.” The agency’s apparent lack of knowledge is “extraordinary,” according to Steven Schooner, a government procurement law professor at George Washington University. “It does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this,” said Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget. “This is a legitimate international scandal and they’re not part of the conversation.” The GSA did not respond to a request for comment. The lease for the D.C. hotel was signed in 2013 and Trump announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. That means the agency has had nearly two years to come up with a plan on what to do if Trump won the presidency. So far, it has refused to state publicly whether it thinks Trump will be in violation of his lease the moment he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. On Wednesday, Trump announced his plans to hand over control of his business to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, while still maintaining his ownership stake. Such an arrangement does little to nothing to resolve any conflicts related to the business. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, called the plan “meaningless” and far short of the steps that every other modern president has taken to eliminate financial conflicts upon taking office.

In the economic hub of Sao Paulo, the main tourist draw Rio de Janeiro and several other metropolitan areas, protesters used barricades of burning tires and other materials to block highways and access to major airports.

Police clashed with demonstrators in several cities, blocking protesters from entering airports and firing tear gas in efforts to free roadways.

Many workers were expected to heed the call to strike for 24 hours starting just after midnight Friday, due in part to anger about progression this week of congressional bills to weaken labor regulations and efforts to change social security that would force many Brazilians to work years longer before drawing a pension. In addition, the strike will extend a holiday weekend ahead of Labor Day on Monday.

This will be Brazil’s first general strike in more than two decades if it gets widespread participation.

Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters A demonstrators holds a placard in front of a burning barricade during a protest against President Michel Temer's proposal to reform Brazil's social security system in the early hours of general strike in Brasilia, Brazil, on April 28, 2017.

Authorities boarded up windows of government buildings in national capital Brasilia on Thursday, fearing violent clashes between demonstrators and police.

Demonstrations are expected in other major cities across the Latin American nation of more than 200 million people.

“It is going to be the biggest strike in the history of Brazil,” said Paulo Pereira da Silva, the president of trade union group Forca Sindical.

Violent protests have occurred repeatedly during the past four years amid political turmoil, Brazil’s worst recession on record, and corruption investigations that revealed stunning levels of graft among politicians.

Nearly a third of Temer’s cabinet and key congressional allies came under investigation in the scandal this month, and approval ratings for the president, who replaced Dilma Rousseff last year after her impeachment, have fallen even further.

Rousseff’s Workers Party grew out of the labor movement, and her allies have called her removal for breaking budget rules an illegitimate coup.

“Temer does not even want to negotiate,” said Vagner Freitas, national president of the Central Workers Union (CUT), Brazil’s biggest labor confederation, said in a statement. “He just wants to meet the demands of the businessmen who financed the coup precisely to end social security and legalize the exploitation of workers.”

Marcio de Freitas, a spokesman for Temer, rejected the union’s criticism, saying the government was working to undo the economic damage wrought under the Workers Party government, which had the backing of the CUT.

“The inheritance of that was 13 million unemployed,” he said. “The government is carrying out reforms to change this situation, to create jobs and economic growth.”",Brazil Cities Paralyzed By Nationwide Strike Against Austerity,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/04/28/brazil-cities-paralyzed-by-nationwide-strike-against-austerity_n_16309504.html

Will there come a day when a woman uses Facebook to out her boss at the bank who’s been uncomfortably patting her on the butt for years while commenting on their “chemistry”? Will we see a time in the not too distant future when the ad executive who’s made it a job qualification for all “hot” interns to have a drink with him get his comeuppance on Twitter, instead of an iron-clad confidentiality agreement completely favoring the company and a Roger Ailes-sized golden parachute?

Probably not, as, aside from the fact these types of incidents are rarely made public ― due to heavily one-sided agreements, these women know, even if they’re on social media, their brave post will most likely be washed over like a grain of sand in the ocean when the next wave rolls in. They also know all too well there’s much more of a chance of being blacklisted and railroaded, or completely ignored, if you’re the only one, and/or especially if you, or your abuser, is not famous. It’s the simple reality. Like a tree in a forest, if TMZ doesn’t pick it up, does it mean it didn’t happen?

Of course, if your abuser is famous/powerful, it may work against you. Just ask #AnitaHill.

Sadly, even during this seismic shift of power from victimizer to victim, having the guts to speak out if you’re a working woman, and you’re the only one ― or think you’re the only one ― is still no easier for the average woman than it was before the hashtag. How do I know this? Because sexual harassment in the workplace is everywhere, every day. If there was such a momentous change, more than half the modern workforce would be fired or under investigation as we speak.

That’s not to say it’s had no effect on the everyday corporate environment. Aside from recent events putting the fear of God into quite a few would-be assaulters, and causing others to re-examine their current behavior, the “Human Resources option” is probably where the change is being felt most. The odds they’ll take your claim much more seriously than they would have just a few years ago have probably skyrocketed.

However, if you’re not planning on doing the “Today Show” and “Good Morning America,” after security escorts you out, who is going to give you another job? You just outed a well-respected, well-liked, and mightily powerful individual in your industry, and most of the world is unaware. Not to mention, you probably just signed an agreement that, upon uttering a word, makes you the guilty party and subject to prosecution. You are alone with your settlement ― if you’re lucky enough to get one. The stigma of being “damaged goods” or added to the unspoken blacklist will most likely follow you for the rest of your days. Even now. So how do we fix that?

Perhaps it needs to begin with changing the entire way we objectify women to being with? Take Miss America, for instance. Where is it written that the shape of a woman’s body, or how she looks in an evening gown, should determine whether or not she is qualified to represent the U.S. to the rest of the world? Does it matter if she’s fat or thin compared to how she views the world and the ideas she offers?

Or, how about electing smarter leaders to set better examples than the ones currently being set by our deplorable POTUS and his supporters?

One area we may want to look at changing immediately are these agreements these women are usually forced to sign, threatening them with all kinds of nasty shit if they so much as whisper about it to a friend. Perhaps we should focus more on protecting her and less on protecting the company, and/or the accused? That might be a good start.

Next, there needs to be a change in leadership roles across the board, as they set the corporate culture. As a friend of a friend so eloquently put it, if you knew about it and did nothing, you’re just as guilty.

Lastly, it’s possible these brave women are, in fact, all around us as we speak and, like the trees, we just don’t hear about them. As is evident by a friend’s comment on my Facebook post.

Again, the whole victim being victimized ― being rewarded for coming forward by being laid off ― needs to be reversed, ASAP. Reporting an incident of abuse/harassment at work should be no different than reporting a crime to the police. You should be protected, not ejected.

Plus, the BJP's combined vote share in the 16 MC chairpersonship elections (41%) is higher than that of the three other parties (16-17% each).

Any omissions or errors are the author's and HuffPost India does not assume any liability or responsibility for them.","Much of the commentary following the recently concluded elections to Uttar Pradesh's urban local bodies (ULBs) - involving chairpersonship contests to 16 municipal corporations (MCs), 198 Nagar Palika Parishads (NPPs) and 438 Nagar Panchayats (NPs) and 11,995 wards therein – has focused on whether the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) claims of having swept the polls are correct.

BJP sympathizers are citing their party's performance in the MCs in support of their claims (14 chairpersonships and wins in 46% of the wards), while its detractors are pointing to the BJP's slim pickings (28% of the chairpersonships and 18% of the wards) if NPP and NP-level results are factored into the overall result.

Readings of whether the Narendra Modi magic remains intact and whether the Adityanath-led state government has cleared its first major test depend on which of the two positions one accords more weight to.

However, in the rush to assess what the results imply for Modi, Adityanath, the BJP and the opposition, a fundamental question – whether these ULB-level election results can be considered a robust indicator of the wider mood in UP and whether they offer a true picture of the ground the state's major political parties may have lost or gained since the state assembly elections earlier this year – has gone unaddressed.

In the opinion of this columnist, there is a case for interpreting the results with caution both by BJP and non-BJP supporters.

UP's urban voters account for only 22% of the total voters in the state; voter turnout was only 53% (61% in the state assembly elections earlier this year); and, the significant proportion of chairpersonships (37%) and wards (64%) picked by independents and smaller parties suggest that local factors may have strongly determined voters' choices. The latter, notably, has been the case in the past too; in 2012, independents and smaller parties picked 80% of the chairpersonships and 87% of the wards. (The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) did not contest the polls then.)

Of the three types of ULBs that went to polls, it is the MCs where non-local issues appear to have played a relatively larger part. In MCs, independents and smaller parties found chairpersonships elusive and won in only 20% of the wards; in contrast, they have accounted for 37% of the chairpersonships and 70% of the wards in NPPs and NPs.

It is to the MC results then we turn to see how well the major political parties have fared – even while recognising that such analysis, given that MCs account for less than half (45%) of UP's urban and only 10% of UP's total voter base, can reflect the mood of only a section of the state's populace.

Data would suggest that the BJP has outperformed the other major parties in MCs. Not only has it bagged 14 of the 16 chairpersonships, but its ward tally (596, of 1,299 total) also comfortably exceeds that of the BSP (147), the Congress (110) and the SP (202). Plus, the BJP's combined vote share in the 16 MC chairpersonship elections (41%) is higher than that of the three other parties (16-17% each).

Having said that, there is reason to suggest that the BJP performance in MCs has not matched up to its assembly election performance.

(a) Wins in 46% of the wards, while representing an increase from 2012 levels (28%, excluding Saharanpur where the 2012 elections were not held), are not particularly flattering for a party that pretty much swept the assembly elections not long ago (winning 312 of the 384 constituencies it contested, a strike rate of 81%).

(b) If vote shares in specific assembly constituencies that broadly correspond with the MCs are taken into account, there is an 8% decline in BJP's vote share from February-March 2017 to now (in chairpersonship/ mayoral voting).

Whether this 8% vote share decline represents a sizeable loss of goodwill for the BJP is an open question given the qualitatively different nature of assembly and ULB-level elections, but the party, ever alert to shifts on ground, will note that it has dropped vote share in mayoral contests in all MCs barring Gorakhpur.

The drops may be modest in some places (5% or under in Faizabad, Moradabad and Lucknow) and possibly tolerable in others (between 5-9% in Aligarh, Agra, Allahabad, Firozabad, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Meerut and Saharanpur), but the over 10% drops in Bareilly, Jhansi, Mathura and Varanasi surely need introspection.

If there is anything comforting in these drops for the BJP, it is that the gains have been divided between its rival parties. The BSP has put up an impressive showing in Aligarh and Meerut (the two mayorships BJP has lost) and, while the MC-level vote share improvements of the Congress and SP are difficult to establish given that they did not contest all corresponding assembly constituencies (being in alliance), it is safe to say that the SP has registered gains in Faizabad and the Congress in Mathura.

In other MCs, the BJP's losses have translated into modest improvements for more than one party, including independents and smaller parties.

Importantly, and in what should be further relieving news for the BJP, the most notable of the BSP, Congress and SP performances have not only come at the expense of the BJP but also at the expense of each other. In Aligarh and Meerut, the BSP has benefited from a consolidation of the anti-BJP vote, as has the SP in Faizabad.

In sum, the message from the UP civic polls is this: The BJP has seen an erosion of support in larger urban centers in the last nine months and the disenchanted voter is yet to begin coalescing around a single opposition party.

By Mohd Imran Khan*, Chandi, Bihar

The winter chill in Bihar brings out smiles on Anita Devi's face because it would help her grow more organic mushrooms along with hundreds of other women in Anantpur and 10 neighboring villages in Nalanda district. By taking to mushroom farming in a big way, Anita has, like many other rural women in the vicinity, ensured a steady income for her family.

The women mushroom farmers are now respected for earning money and have contributed to change the socio-economic condition of their families for the better. ""Mushroom farming has not only empowered me and hundreds of other women, it has given boost to our rural economy,"" Anita, in her late 40s and speaking like an executive in her office adjacent to her house, told VillageSquare.in. ""Thanks to mushroom growing, women in villages are now earning members, and are no longer dependent on their husbands and family.""

Anita's words sound convincing as she has single-handedly changed her own fortune, and that of hundreds of other women by mushroom farming in past seven years. She is now well-known for motivating, inspiring and engaging a large number of women to grow mushrooms in her native village Anantpur and neighboring villages under Chandi block in Nalanda district.

When she started her journey to grow mushrooms in 2010, the scenario was difficult and unfriendly. It was a totally new concept in her village. She was trained in growing mushrooms at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University in Pusa, Samastipur district, and G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology in Uttarakhand and also learnt about mushroom seed production. ""When I was desperate to earn something, I approached Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Harnaut in Nalanda. The officials advised me to grow mushrooms. After that, I began my new journey of success.""

Fruits of success

Anita's move to grow mushrooms has given an opportunity for her husband Sanjay Kumar, who was struggling to earn a livelihood. Now he is a part of her team and helping her in her mushroom venture. With respectable profits from mushroom farming, Anita's husband has opened a garment shop in nearby Madhopur bazaar. Her two sons are pursuing graduation in horticulture and her only daughter is pursuing a B.Ed program.

""Some co-villagers, particularly women, used to taunt me for growing Gobar Chatta, as wild mushroom is known locally. They hardly missed an opportunity to embarrass me by telling that it will not help me to change my life,"" Anita, a graduate in home science, told VillageSquare.in. ""Ignoring all this during the initial days, mushroom farming proved successful and I was lucky to emerge as a role model for others that inspires many women to join me and follow me. They have adopted mushroom cultivation. Now there are hundreds of mushroom growing women farmers here.""

She is right. Her hard work and success to grow mushroom first attracted dozens of women from her village to start mushroom farming, followed by women in neighboring villages. After that, her nondescript village Anantpur has been declared a Mushroom Village in 2012 by a team of state agriculture department comprising the principal secretary, district administration, and experts from agriculture universities. Her success in popularizing mushroom cultivation and close association with mushroom is such that local people in Nalanda call her Mushroom Mahila (mushroom woman).

Spreading the message

Encouraged by her success, Anita has formed Madhopur Farmers Producers Company Limited at her newly built house to involve more women from neighboring villages to grow organic mushrooms. There are nearly 250 women currently attached with her company. ""In last few years, I have visited several villages in Nalanda and formed self-help groups (SHGs) of women. I have targeted to double the number of women. If things move as per planning, I will fulfill the target of including 500 women to grow mushrooms by next year.""

These women have been linked to SHGs formed under Jeevika, the Bihar government's rural livelihood program. Jeevika has been promoting large number of women SHGS with various incentives to take up mushroom farming to earn a livelihood. ""At present, more than 50 women are growing mushrooms in Madhopur Dih village, 30 women in Rajan Bigha village, 40 in Raitha village, 25 in Soradih village, 15 in Raisha, 10 in Kurthia village and dozens in other villages,"" Anita told VillageSquare.in.

She said that dozens of women associated with her company are cultivating mushrooms in villages outside Chandi block, including 100 women in Saril-Chak village under Nalanda block, and two villages in Bind block.

Anita and other women are mainly growing Oyster and Milky White mushrooms because the ease in growing them. Oyster mushrooms grow on almost all types of agricultural wastes, which are locally available free of cost.

""Both mushroom varieties are suitable to grow in the climate of Nalanda and profit is at least two to three fold. Women are also keen to grow button mushrooms but growing button mushrooms is very high-tech and requires investment and space,"" Anita said. ""Due to lack of facility, we are unable to grow button mushroom.""

""September to March is the best season here for cultivation of mushroom. We are growing mushrooms during the period without any air-conditioning facility because it is possible during comfortable weather,"" she told VillageSquare.in. ""We also grow some mushroom during summer.""

Profitable occupation

On an average, the daily production of oyster mushroom from her center is around 15 kg to 20 kg, which is sold at Rs 80 to wholesalers and Rs 120 to retailers. Her monthly income is more than Rs 25,000 from mushroom farming. In a reference to other women mushroom growers, she said that mushroom is sold both from their houses where buyers come directly as well as in the market.

By growing mushrooms, women have transformed their luck. Mushroom has given them self-confidence, economic independence and an identity. ""Women have successfully changed their status from poverty-stricken to prosperous thanks to mushroom,"" said Anita. For women, who have no extra source of income, growing mushrooms is simple, viable and profitable venture. ""I have encouraged women to grow mushroom in their house with virtually no investment to begin with. Mushroom is easily grown indoors during the winter.""

Manju Devi, another mushroom grower, said mushroom growing is easy and does not require a lot of space. She recalled how mushroom farming has changed the lives of several women. ""A woman mushroom grower Maya Devi has used her profit from mushroom to educate her son engineer and Rita Devi's mushroom farming has turned her sons self-employed now,"" she informed VillageSquare.in.

Bipin Kumar, field officer of Jeevika in Nalanda, said mushroom cultivation is boosting the income of women in rural areas. ""Mushroom farming has given a tremendous boost to women's empowerment,"" he said.

According to Bipin, who has been in constant touch with women of SHGs in villages spread across Nalanda, mushroom growing has positive impact on their lives and empowered them economically and socially and helped them to become self-reliant. It has also paved the way for farm diversification.

Seed production

Anita has also set up a high-tech lab for mushroom seed production. ""National Horticulture Mission has financially helped me by providing nearly Rs 15 lakh under subsidy scheme to set up mushroom seed production facility two years ago,"" she told VillageSquare.in.

""When I started growing mushrooms, I used to purchase 20 kg of seed from Rajendra Agriculture University because seed was not available locally. When dozens of women joined me to grow mushroom and demand for seed increased manifold, I requested the university to provide me 300 kg of seed. It refused on the ground that so much seed is not available for one buyer. So I decided to set up a mushroom seed production facility at Anantpur.""

Anita's lab has been selling mushroom seeds to small-scale mushroom growers, mostly women, NGOs and government agencies. ""At present I am selling 20 kg to 25 kg mushroom seed daily on an average but its demand will increase with more chill and fog,"" she said.

She pointed out that mushroom is being cultivated on a large scale in Nalanda, as it is profitable farming, unlike traditional crops and vegetables. At present, the market is growing and is far better than it was few years ago. There is no problem to market mushroom after harvesting, she said.

Uma Shankar Bhagat, district project manager of Jeevika in Nalanda, told VillageSquare.in that mushroom cultivation by small and marginal farmers, particularly women, has proved a successful way out of poverty. ""The number of women mushroom growers is growing in Nalanda, known for mushroom farming in Bihar.""

He acknowledged the role of Anita Devi in popularizing and motivating women to take up mushroom cultivation. ""Anita is not only an icon of mushroom growing, she is also known for mushroom seed production and mushroom processing facility in rural Nalanda.""

In an address to the Egyptian people this week, Francis said he hoped his visit would help bring peace and encourage dialogue and reconciliation with the Islamic world.

But it comes at a painful time for Egypt’s Copts, the Middle East’s largest Christian community, three weeks after Islamic State suicide bombers killed 45 people in twin church bombings.

Those attacks followed a cathedral bombing that killed 28 people in December and a spree of murders that has forced hundreds of Christians to flee North Sinai, where the group is most active.

“Pope of Peace in Egypt of Peace,” read posters plastered along the road leading from the airport to central Cairo, showing a smiling pope, his hand raised above the Christian cross and the Crescent moon of Islam.

Streets close to the Vatican embassy in Cairo and other sites have been cleared of cars and blocked off, and pedestrians were not allowed to linger.

“After all the pain we have experienced ... we are satisfied and confident that the state is taking strong security measures to prevent terrorism and protect churches,” said Father Boulos Halim, spokesman of the Coptic Orthodox church to which the majority of Egypt’s Christians belong.

“It’s in the state’s interests to protect its nationals and the Copts are not an independent people, they are part and parcel of the nation itself.”

STRAINED RELATIONS

Francis will meet President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi; Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, the world’s most influential seat of Sunni Islamic theology and learning; and Pope Tawadros II, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church who narrowly escaped a church bombing in Alexandria on Palm Sunday.

Francis is expected to give his key address to a conference on religious dialogue at Al-Azhar, part of efforts to improve relations with the 1,000-year-old centre after Egyptian Muslim leaders cut ties in 2011 over what they said were repeated insults against Islam by Pope Benedict.

Tayeb visited the Vatican last year after restoring relations. Widely considered among the most moderate clerics in Egypt, Tayeb has condemned Islamic State and its practice of declaring others as infidels as a pretext for waging jihad.

Francis denounces violence in God’s name and papal aides say a moderate like Tayeb would be an important ally in condemning radical Islam.

But Tayeb is under fire over the slow pace of reform at Azhar, which critics in Egypt’s parliament and media accuse of failing to combat the religious foundations of Islamist extremism. They say Azhar is an ossified institution whose clerics have resisted pressure from Sisi to modernise their religious discourse.",Pope Francis Arrives In Egypt Seeking Peace And Reconciliation,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/04/28/pope-francis-egypt_n_16309462.html

An improvised, low-tech pipe bomb device was affixed to his chest with Velcro and zip ties. The explosion, which occurred around 7:20 a.m. in the subway near Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, immediately plunged the commuter hub into chaos. Five people have been treated at two Mount Sinai hospitals for minor injuries related to the incident, the hospital said in a statement to HuffPost. They had all been released by about 5 p.m. local time. Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, who they said is a U.S. resident from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong. According to investigators, Ullah, who had no criminal record, triggered the bomb intentionally and mentioned the self-described Islamic State after his arrest. He last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, authorities said. Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press the suspect used matches, a lightbulb and a nine-volt battery to ignite a pipe stuffed with explosive material, but the blast wasn’t powerful enough to create harmful shrapnel. The man was injured himself, and had burns on his hands and abdomen, as well as lacerations, authorities said. He was being treated at Bellevue Hospital.

New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission/Handout/Reuters Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi man who police say attempted to detonate a homemade bomb in New York City on Monday, in a photo released by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.

The bomber reportedly told investigators he was inspired by terror attacks on Christmas markets in Europe, and chose the location in Manhattan due to its holiday-themed posters, The New York Times reported. He also said the bombing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria and other locations. Officials were preparing to charge Ullah in federal court in Manhattan, and the incident is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Times reported. Ullah lived with his father, mother and brother in an area of Brooklyn that has a large Bangladeshi community, his neighbors told the AP. Alan Butrico, who owns the house next door to Ullah and a locksmith business two doors down, said: “It’s very weird … You never know who your neighbors are.” The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver’s license from 2012 to 2015, after which it expired.

Police Commissioner James O’Neill called the explosion a “terror-related incident” during a mid-morning news conference. He declined to elaborate on Ullah’s statement, but called on citizens to come forward with information about the event and other concerning behavior. “We are New Yorkers. We don’t live in fear,” O’Neill said at a briefing. “If you see something doesn’t look right, you have an obligation to come forward, call 911, flag down a cop, and give us a chance to investigate it.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) described the explosive as a “low-tech device” and said the plot was isolated to one individual.

“This is one of my nightmares: a terror attack in the subway system. Luckily, the damage was minimal, but this was one in a growing pattern that we’re seeing develop,” Cuomo said on Spectrum News NY1 later Monday afternoon. “The good news is that we were on top of it. We have the greatest law enforcement force on the planet, in my opinion, and the reality was not as bad as the fear.” Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at an earlier press conference alongside Cuomo, stressed that terrorists “yearn to attack New York City.” “All we know of is one individual who, thank God, was unsuccessful in his aims,” he said. President Donald Trump said in a statement that the attempted attack proved the relevance of his executive order restricting the entry of travelers from eight countries into the United States. He also said the attempt showed the need for restrictions to so-called chain migration, which allows people to sponsor visas of family members besides spouses and unmarried minor children. “First and foremost, as I have been saying since I first announced my candidacy for President, America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows for too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,” the president said. The area where the explosion occurred is one of New York City’s busiest tourist and commuter zones. The Times Square-42nd Street/Port Authority station serves a dozen subway lines and a variety of local and regional bus lines. The blast immediately sent the key transit hub into chaos. The A, C and E subway lines were evacuated, Sgt. Brendan Ryan told HuffPost, and the busy Port Authority bus terminal was cleared and temporarily shut down. Other trains bypassed Times Square and Port Authority stations. Rosemary Usoh, 40, told HuffPost she was on the third floor of the bus terminal around 7:15 a.m. when at least a dozen police officers with automatic weapons shouted for people to evacuate the building immediately. “They yelled at us to get out, that there was an explosion,” Usoh said. “I was nervous. There were a lot of people running.” Alicja Wlodkowski, 51, told The New York Times that she was in a restaurant inside the bus terminal building when the explosion occurred. “A woman fell, and nobody even stopped to help her because it was so crazy,” Wlodkowski said. “Then it all slowed down. I was standing and watching and scared.” Video shows emergency crews responding to the Port Authority bus terminal on 42nd Street.

U.S. President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump kicked off a global business summit in southern India on Tuesday calling for better opportunities for women entrepreneurs battling heavy odds around the world.

Ivanka, also an informal adviser to her father, received a warm welcome in India's high-tech hub of Hyderabad with all the trappings of a state guest.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined her in the opening of the U.S.-backed Global Entrepreneurship Summit which New Delhi is hoping will further boost political and economic ties with the United States under the Trump administration.

Ivanka, wearing a bright green floral dress, said fuelling the growth of women-led businesses and closing the gender entrepreneurship gap could help expand global GDP by 2 percent.

""Women still face steep obstacles to starting, owning and growing their businesses. We must ensure women entrepreneurs have access to capital, access to networks and mentors,"" Ivanka said to loud cheers from a packed audience in a heavily-guarded conference centre.

In developing countries, 70 percent of women-owned smaller businesses were being denied access to capital, she said, leading to a near $300 billion annual credit deficit for them.

GES is an event conceived by former U.S. President Barack Obama. It has previously been held in countries such as the United States and Turkey, but this year's edition is the first under the Trump administration.

The theme of the conference this year is ""Women First, Prosperity for All"". More than half the participants at the summit are women, and all-female delegations are representing countries such as Afghanistan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Ivanka, who ran an eponymous clothing and jewellery business before becoming an adviser in the White House, has made women's issues one of her main policy areas.

She cited a Harvard Business Review report that found that in the United States investors ask men questions about their potential for gains, whereas they ask women questions about their potential for loss.

Billboards with pictures of Ivanka dotted many parts of Hyderabad which is also home to major U.S. firms such as Microsoft. In recent days, authorities took beggars off city streets in a clean-up drive before the meeting, media said.

More than 10,000 police officials were deployed in the city and sniffer dogs as well as ""spotters"", or men trained to detect any suspicious activity or people, were on stand by, a police officer said.

On the sidelines, Ivanka held talks with Modi, as well as Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj. Later she toured the conference centre with Modi and met a few entrepreneurs, before watching traditional Indian dance performances in the inaugural session.

""This event not only connects the Silicon Valley with Hyderabad but also show-cases the close ties between the United States of America and India. It underlines our shared commitment towards encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation,"" Modi said.

India has become a major market for the United States, with two-way trade of about $115 billion last year. They aim to raise that to $500 billion by 2022. Military and strategic ties are also improving as China's influence rises in Asia and beyond.

""The Trump administration sees India as a strategic partner and wants to engage with India more.

A fierce attack on India's large informal market a year ago, and its resilience in gaining back its conventional character right now are two common themes in the slew of analysis a year after demonetisation.

Data from various reports points at the long-term damage to the rural markets due to a sustained fall in commodity prices and loss of cash wages, which negatively affected the farming sector and consumption in rural areas. Contrary to that, recovery in urban informal markets has reportedly been quicker.

So how do we understand the resilience of urban informality in India?

One way it to know how the urban poor finance their household expenses and small businesses despite the weak conventional financial infrastructure provisioned to them.

One way it to know how the urban poor finance their household expenses and small businesses despite the weak conventional financial infrastructure provisioned to them.

The presence of a large number of banks and formal credit institutions in Indian cities does not facilitate sufficient access to the urban poor because access to finance is also about the processes, spatiality, technology and rules. A bank located in a middle-class neighbourhood requires forms to be filled, needs KYC documents, requires a minimum balance to be maintained, a guarantee for loans, and access to mobile technology.

These general 'gatekeeper' barriers often make such sites inaccessible to the urban poor.

Trinamool Congress (TMC) political party agitation as part of a nationwide protest against demonetisation Front of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Kolkata on January 11, 2017.

In India, to an extent, this gap is filled by formal and informal micro-finance facilities who are fundamentally different from banks in how they reach out to the poor even at their door-step to disburse and collect loans. The fact that the urban clientele of micro-finance institutes (MFIs) stands at 67 per cent shows how heavily urban regions are serviced by them, contrary to popular opinion.

In addition, there are other forms of finance too that are prevalent, popular and even more informal, like pawn brokers who generally operate privately but even set up shops where demand is high, like in city markets.

However the urban poor do not — or cannot — just depend on such instruments that enable access to money to confront weak financial infrastructure. They also adopt tactical choices to cut costs of doing business or to substitute their household expenses. For instance, they leverage space. For a vegetable seller, using pavements is a way to save on property cost for their business. They leverage mobility.

For a plastic commodity seller on a push cart, owning a mobile shop is a great way to reach a high number of customers, save on property cost, and disentangle themselves from the regulatory rules of running a formal business. They leverage pop-up markets. For small businessmen periodic Haat bazaars, festival congregations and public events serve as one-off opportunities to sell more than usual.

A snack vendor pushes a food cart on a street in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, on Saturday, Oct. 29, 2017.

They often wager their physical health. For porters, to employ hand-pulled trolleys instead of fuel-driven ones, or waste collectors handling hazardous material by bare hands is a bet they make to remain competitive in the cut-throat urban labour market. And as we see prominently these days, they leverage accessible technology. The recent spurt of cab services such as Ola and food delivery services such as Swiggy, are examples of how quickly job seekers, mostly from lower income groups adopted smart phones equipped with easy-to-use applications when they saw a big opportunity in app-based work.

The urban poor also leverage 'ecological infrastructure'. In her book 'Nature in the city: Bengaluru in the past, present, and future', ecologist Harini Nagendra mentions the importance of kitchen gardens and lakes in Bangalore for serving the household needs of many communities. However, we need more research to know the extent to which, and in what way, the poor use the ecological option in current circumstances of fundamentally changed urban ecology.

Lastly it is not always the poor themselves who find substitutes for formal financial services; the state does too in the form of instruments such as subsidies, credit guarantees and soft loans to compensate what the poor cannot avail through networked financial services.

These observations can extend to many other actors, institutions, equipment and technology, yet these examples are sufficient to say that finance has multiple and diverse channels when it comes to households or businesses run by the poor. While we are still strengthening our banking and credit facilities, and implementing programmes to formalise the economy it is critical to remember that these channels will remain the only buffer for millions of poor until then.

In fact, informal and substitute modes of finance are a critical component of a modernising economy which is still in a transitional phase. These modes may have a low share in tax and digital economy, yet their biggest utility is in acting as 'shock absorbers' for the poor from the disruptive effects of sudden changes in the way transactions happen. Therefore, dismantling this crucial component will rather make the transition in the economy more lopsided.

A better policy might have two parallel sets of goals. On the one hand, it would increase banking access, build the capacity of the poor to use banking and payments technology, and create schemes to hand-hold small businesses. On the other, it will open up spaces for street vendors, negotiate time-slots for haat bazaars in city markets, encourage non-polluting options of transport in inner areas and reclaim and reimagine land-use and lakes to support traditional livelihoods.",The Urban Poor Created Ingenious Coping Methods After Demonetisation,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/siddhant-nowlakha/the-urban-poor-created-ingenious-coping-methods-after-demonetisation_a_23299870/

Former Vice President Joe Biden also recorded a robocall for Jones, Politico reported Monday. Biden previously campaigned for Jones in October.

Neither call mentions Moore by name. National officials want to avoid the perception that they are getting too involved in the race, which has drawn outsized national attention because of the accusations against Moore.

While many national Republicans have sought to distance themselves from Moore, President Donald Trump has endorsed him, defended him against the allegations and recorded his own robocall to GOP voters late last week.

“I’m going to make America safer and stronger and better than ever before. We need that seat. We need Roy voting for us,” Trump says in the call.

An Obama robocall may be just what Jones needs to gin up excitement for his campaign on the eve of the election.

Joseph De Sciose, a 64-year-old photographer in Birmingham, told HuffPost last week that he still has Obama’s robocall on his voicemail at home from last year, when he urged Alabamans to vote for Hillary Clinton for president.

“My wife still listens to it,” said Sciose. “We’re never getting rid of that one. Because it’s so cool to hear his voice.”

Mumbai Mirror quoted police sources as saying that he often travelled on the route.

Sachdev has been booked under section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of IPC, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) since Wasim is 17 years old, a report in the Economic Times said.

Wasim has accused Sachdev, who sat behind her on Air Vistara's flight to Mumbai, of keeping his feet on her armrest and running it over her back, neck and shoulders as she struggled to document the violation and draw the attention of the crew.

""The lights were dimmed, so it was even worse. It continued for another 5-10 minutes and then I was sure of it. He kept nudging my shoulder and continued to move his foot up and down my back and neck,"" Wasim wrote on an Instagram live story. She posted a photo of a man's foot and said, because the cabin lights were dimmed she could not get a better photo as evidence of the trauma she suffered.

She is seen crying in the video and saying ""It's not done at all.""

In a statement, Air Vistara said it was investigating the incident.

Sources in the airline told ANI that Wasim ""had not brought the incident to notice of the crew till the flight commenced descent. After landing the crew inquired about the incident and asked Zaira and her mother if they want to file a complaint but they denied."" However, Tuhin Mishra, Wasim's manager, told news channels that they had in fact approached cabin crew, ""but they didn't act"".

Condemning the incident as ""shameful"", Maharashtra State Commission for Women's chairperson, Vijaya Rahatkar, said MSCW will direct DGCA to conduct an inquiry in the matter. Several political parties have reacted to the incident.

Wasim won a National Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing a young Geeta Phogat in the film Dangal.

We hear it. We don’t like it. And attitudes such as these must change if we ever hope to see change.

There are reasons why coal miners have voted for pro-industry politicians, and naïveté and gullibility are not foremost among them. A common misconception is that today’s miners are old style traditionalists dedicated to mining coal as a continuation of the way of life they’ve inherited. This may be the case for foreman wearing white hardhats who receive invitations to the White House, but the rest of us are not quite so obtuse. When mining families defend the industry outside the confines of sheer economic necessity, they do so in response to the assault on their culture by outside elitists and out-of-touch environmental groups.

Those of us who entered the mines during the coal market upswing of the 2000s were facing difficult, if not impossible choices. Some of the men I worked with were tired of being away from home, spending weeks on the road to earn a living as construction workers or commercial truck drivers. Others were prison guards who could no longer handle the mental stresses of working in the region’s super maximum-security prisons. Relocating one’s family was no easy option either. Real estate values in an economically depressed region do not compare to areas with better job opportunities. Even if we had the financial ability to relocate, we were still faced with the prospect of competing for jobs in areas where public schools are better funded and there are more people with college degrees.

In Appalachia, we at least had a sense of place that reaches back generations, and the support of friends and family. When you have that, coal mining doesn’t seem quite so bad, but it no way means you are unaware of your standing within the grand scheme of things.

Miners are still keenly aware that their labor is doing more to benefit outside investors and corporate executives than it is their communities. We have all witnessed friends and family fight in vain for compensation after suffering from permanent injuries and black lung. We have seen the companies file bankruptcy to shirk their financial obligations to our forefathers. Everyone also understands that they must walk a straight company line or else risk finding themselves among the next group to be laid off in a market downturn.

Few people seem to realize the lack of choices miners face. They do not realize that many miners would jump at the chance to earn a decent living without risking their life and sacrificing their health. The problem is, even with re-training, there are no jobs waiting that can match the salaries and benefits they have now. The last thing coal miners need to hear are promises of economic development from environmental organizations and politicians looking for votes and funding.

This is all obvious to us “ignorant hillbillies.” It is also obvious to us that we are frequently characterized as simple-minded white trash in the national media and by faux hillbilly authors like J.D. Vance. And we know why this happens: because this kind of caricature makes it seem to be our fault. Like we were too dumb to leave when the coal industry crashed. Like we are the ones too stupid to understand the environmental costs. Like we were the ones who foolishly believed Trump would bail us out.

On Monday, Plummer was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his role as billionaire oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Director Ridley Scott landed Plummer for the part after removing Spacey amid the sexual misconduct claims.

The movie’s crew unanimously agreed to reshoot key scenes at the last minute ahead of the film’s Christmas release date.

“It isn’t replacing. In a funny way it’s starting all over again because it’s going to be different, naturally,” Plummer told “Entertainment Tonight” about Spacey’s exit from the film. “I think it’s very sad what happened to him. Kevin is such a talented and a terrifically gifted actor, and it’s so sad. It’s such a shame.”

Michelle Williams also snagged an acting nomination for her work in the film, and Scott was honored with a Best Director nod.

“This doesn’t do anything to ease the suffering of people who were all too personally affected by Kevin Spacey, but it is our little act of trying to right a wrong,” Williams said. “And it sends a message to predators — you can’t get away with this anymore. Something will be done.”

Broadway actor Anthony Rapp was first to come forward with a story in October about Spacey sexual harassing him when he was 14 years old. In the ensuing days, others accused Spacey of similarly predatory acts, prompting his firing from the Netflix series “House of Cards.”

Spacey apologized to Rapp in a much-criticized statement, in which he publicly declared he was gay for the first time, and said he would seek “evaluation and treatment.”

But it’s not just young people who are affected by Instagram ― the UPitt study mentioned above dealt with adults up to age 32. And the harmful effects of Insta-envy likely don’t stop there, says Emily Weinstein, a Harvard University researcher who recently published her own study on Instagram use. “Comparison doesn’t just happen in adolescents or jealous people. Events at every stage of life could give you that reaction,” she told HuffPost. For a self-conscious teen, seeing photos of flawlessly fit bloggers might ignite jealousy. For a single 20-something, images of happy couples could cause despair. “It can happen at any age.” HuffPost spoke with psychology experts, most of whom agreed that avoiding Instagram entirely is unrealistic in our hyperconnected society. Instead, they offered tips for using the app in a way that leaves us healthier instead of harmed. 1. Unfollow accounts that don’t bring you joy. Think of this as the KonMari method for your Insta feed: Next time you open the app to a particular photo, ask how the image makes you feel. Does that shot of your friend’s vacation make you feel dejected for sitting at your desk? Does the photo of your baby nephew give you a boost of feel-good fuzzies? Keep in mind that the same image that produces a negative feeling for one person may bring about positive feelings for another, Weinstein said. “For some people, [following] those design and decor blogs is very calming, and for others, the photos make them envious, because their homes don’t look like that,” she said. “We’re not going to all look at same content and have the same reaction.”

Alexandra Iakovleva via Getty Images

That’s why it’s important to evaluate for yourself which accounts bring you joy and which don’t, Weinstein said. While you can do this photo by photo each time you log in to the app, she says it’s more likely you already know which accounts inspire you and which make you feel jealous, sad or have an onslaught of FOMO. “Most of us can figure out where to start [unfollowing accounts], and once you start, it becomes obvious and a habit,” she said. “It’s mindfulness. It’s elevating your awareness.” If you can’t tell whether an account improves your mental state or not, Weinstein suggests unfollowing it for a few weeks and seeing if you miss it. You can always refollow later. 2. Bulk up the positive content. While you’re at it, you may want to follow more accounts similar to the ones that make you feel good, Weinstein said. For many people, these are funny meme accounts or ones that deal with specific hobbies like travel or art. 3. Constantly remind yourself that people aren’t posting their real lives. Sure, we all know that Instagram presents a filtered version of reality. But it’s critical to keep this top of mind while scrolling, said Brain Primack, lead author of the University of Pittsburgh study. We may subconsciously expect celebrity images to be altered but forget that our friends carefully choose and edit their photos, too. “When we see [Instagrams of] a model or an [advertisement], we know that person ‘isn’t real,’ or that they’ve been Photoshopped,” Primack said. “But when you see your college friends having this wonderful life, you know them as real people, so you don’t think of the fact that they’re carefully curating what they put out there. It’s easy to think, ‘Hey, everybody else is having a great life and is more successful than I am. I have challenges.’”

courtneyk via Getty Images

In her study, Weinstein found that teens’ attitudes toward Instagram affected how they felt after scrolling through a feed. Those who kept in mind that the images were “curated and effortful” reported more positive emotions after viewing than those who took the feeds “more literally” and thus made harmful mental comparisons such as “that person’s life is better than mine.” Weinstein concluded that actively reminding teens about the curated nature of Instagram photos could leave them with a greater sense of well-being after scrolling. Do your brain a favor, and give yourself a similar reminder before you browse. 4. Post, like, comment and message more often. Overall, we spend more time looking at social media (aka “passively viewing”) than we do responding to posts or creating our own (aka “actively viewing”). A 2015 study of Facebook habits found that participants used the site passively about 50 percent more than they used it actively. A subsequent study from researchers around the world found that passive use tended to produce damaging social comparisons and envy, while active use created feelings of social connectedness and friendship. This means that commenting on and posting Instagram photos is preferable to mindless scrolling, said Philippe Verduyn, the study’s lead author and an assistant psychology professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. “Merely looking at the pictures of your Instagram connections is not the way to go,” he said. “You may easily end up thinking that other people’s lives are much better than yours ... It is better to actively reach out to your online connections: engage with them, share pictures ― you will feel more connected to your online friends, as they are likely to actively respond to your posts as well.”

Of course, commenting on photos just as often as you look at them is a more involved task. But the potential results of doing so are worth considering. 5. Ask yourself the “five whys.” Many users are familiar with the feeling of scrolling through an Instagram feed in order to avoid something, whether it be getting out of a cozy bed in the morning or working up the nerve to respond to a confrontational text message. Sometimes, guilt sets in when we realize just how long we’ve spent “killing time” on the app. To reduce this feeling ― and to make your browsing experience more fulfilling overall ― it’s helpful to analyze precisely why you look at Instagram, according to Oscar Ybarra, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan who co-authored the study with Verduyn. His “five whys” process involves asking yourself why you’re using Instagram (maybe it’s “because I’m bored waiting in line at the grocery,” for example), then asking into that answer again (“Why am I bored waiting in line? Because I’m not talking to the people around me.”) and again (“Why aren’t I talking to the people around me? Because I’m nervous to initiate conversation.”) until you’ve done it five times. The results could be revealing (“Next time, I’ll be bold and say hello to someone in line at the grocery.”). “People should ask themselves why they are using [Instagram],” Ybarra told HuffPost. “Then, once they have their answer to the first why, they should interrogate this answer by asking ‘why’ again, and continue this process. Many times we log on to these sites mindlessly for distraction or to fill time, but we never confront ourselves and ask why we’re doing it.”",This Is The Healthiest Way To Browse Instagram,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/12/07/healthiest-way-to-use-instagram_n_18761384.html?ir=Healthy+Living

Panic buttons are rapidly gaining popularity as a way to protect hotel employees who work alone and enter intimate spaces.
Hotels in New York City are already required to provide panic buttons under a collective bargaining agreement with labor unions.
As the hotel association’s board notes make clear, the hotel lobby fears that unions have a winning issue with panic buttons.","Many worker advocates view sexual harassment and assault as a pervasive danger for hotel housekeepers who work alone. As HuffPost reported last week, the concern is so great that several cities have moved to outfit housekeepers with handheld panic buttons that can alert hotel security when workers feel threatened.

But at least one group isn’t buying the merits of the panic button idea: the hotel industry.

At its annual board meeting last November, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the leading lobby for the industry, characterized panic buttons as a “fig leaf” for other regulations being proposed for hotels, like higher minimum wages or caps on housekeepers’ workloads.

According to notes obtained by HuffPost, the board suggested panic buttons weren’t necessary to protect housekeepers, and outlined plans to push back against the new regulations.

“While deemed by many experts and hoteliers to be a solution in search of a problem, the panic button message has proved to be an effective fig leaf for the new workforce rules, making the initiative appear to be about protecting women, rather than the merits of the other mandates,” the board notes state.

The context for those remarks was an ordinance proposed in Seattle to require large hotels to provide workers with panic buttons and to track guests who’ve been accused of harassment or assault. But the ordinance included other measures, such as limiting housekeepers’ workloads to prevent injuries and obligating hotels to help pay for workers’ health insurance.

Seattle voters overwhelmingly approved the whole package, known as Measure 124, last November. Hotel groups sued to stop the measure from going into effect, primarily over privacy concerns for guests accused of harassment. A judge dismissed the lawsuit targeting the ordinance, which was championed by the hospitality workers union Unite Here.

Panic buttons are rapidly gaining popularity as a way to protect hotel employees who work alone and enter intimate spaces. Seattle was the first city to enact a panic button ordinance. The city council of Long Beach, Calif., narrowly voted one down earlier this year, but the city council of Chicago passed one last month. Hotels in New York City are already required to provide panic buttons under a collective bargaining agreement with labor unions.

As the hotel association’s board notes make clear, the hotel lobby fears that unions have a winning issue with panic buttons. Polling and “message testing” in Seattle quickly proved that the hotels’ position against the ordinance was a loser, according to the notes. The board said it had developed a new social media campaign to “counter attacks about hotel working conditions” and “illustrate the underhanded union tactics being deployed.”

Noting the likelihood that more cities would pursue panic button legislation, the board said it had “already begun to lay the lobbying and campaign groundwork to fight back.”

In an email, Unite Here spokeswoman Rachel Gumpert said the hotel association’s description of panic buttons as “a solution in search of a problem” was “astoundingly inept and insulting to the tens of thousands of our hotel workers who have experienced unwanted sexual contact and advances at work.” She said the group should apologize for “denying the prevalence of sexual harassment of hotel workers as well as insulting the intentions of women who are fighting back against it.”

Rosanna Maietta, a spokeswoman for the American Hotel and Lodging Association, said in an email that the safety of guests and hotel employees is a “top priority,” and that the group had partnered with non-profits to develop safety training programs for hotels. She also noted that the Seattle ordinance “went beyond simple panic buttons” to include the other provisions.

“While no industry is immune to dealing with sexual harassment as the headlines over recent weeks have shown ― from Hollywood to the media industry and even [the Service Employees International Union] ― our industry has in place procedures and protocols for employees around reporting and prevention and these are continuously reviewed and updated,” Maietta wrote. “As an industry, we will continue our work, day in and day out, with a focus on ensuring America’s hotels are secure places for all those who work and visit them.”

The panic button measure approved in Chicago also requires hotels to develop sexual harassment policies, show workers how to report incidents and provide them with time to file complaints with the police. Maietta said the ordinance was “the product of collaboration and compromise” between stakeholders including the Illinois hotel lobby.

The Chicago law gained wide support after Unite Here released the results of a survey of 500 Chicago-area hotel and casino workers. More than half of hotel workers said they had been sexually harassed by a guest, and 49 percent said they had experienced guests answering the door naked or otherwise exposing themselves.

One such worker shared her story with HuffPost. While working as a minibar attendant, she was invited into a room by a male guest who turned out to be masturbating. “I felt like crying,” the worker said.

Correction: This post originally stated that the Seattle ordinance could be waived for hotels with collective bargaining agreements. In fact, only the portions of the ordinance not related to sexual harassment could be waived.

Hadiya, a woman from Kerala at the centre of a controversy about her marriage to a Muslim man and conversion to Islam, has a strict life of minimum exposure to the outside world awaiting her at her college hostel where she will continue her homeopathy studies under her her Hindu name – Akhila Ashokan.

The Supreme Court yesterday freed her from the custody of her parents, but the college rules aren't a walk in the park either.

Hadiya, 25, flew to Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu from Delhi and headed to Salem by road. She was accompanied by the Kerala police, and is due to undergo a 11-month internship in homeopathy at the Sivaraj Medical College in Salem, about 170 km from Coimbatore. She was not permitted to speak to the media at the airport in Coimbatore.

A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra turned down her plea that she should be allowed to go with her husband Shafin Jahan who would pay for all expenses for her internship course.

Salem medical College Principal G Kannan said Hadiya will be treated as one of the inmates of the hostel and that no special treatment will be accorded to her.

Hadiya alias Akhila at the supreme court after hearing on November 27, 2017 in New Delhi, India.

The rules of the hostel are strict.

The Indian Express quoted Kannan as saying that while previously students were allowed to use cellphones in the hostel for only an hour a day, in light of this sensitive case, he was thinking of banning phones for all students staying in the hostel.

""Since they are here to study, a phone with the warden is more than enough,"" he said. The hostel does not have a television set. Students have to report to college at 8:45 am and lights are turned off at 10:30 pm.

According to the report, once a week, students are allowed to go out for shopping, but never unescorted. The warden accompanies them. It must be mentioned here that the students are all above the age of 18.

Kannan has also told the paper that he will not allow ""anyone except her parents"" to meet her. And when parents come to meet her, ""we will make sure that I or an official are present.""

Hadiya was in the custody of her parents for almost six months after the Kerala High Court had on 29 May anulled her 'nikah' with Shafin Jahan.

""Hadiya does not have any idea about Syria, where she wanted to go after converting to Islam. I cannot have a terrorist in the family.""

Deputy Commissioner of Police Subbbulakshmi, who held a meeting with college authorities in Salem, told reporters that adequate protection will be given to the woman. Hadiya's father welcomed the apex court decision allowing her to continue her studies and said he did not want a terrorist in the family

Hadiya, KM Ashokan said, wanted to go to Syria after converting to Islam but had no idea about what it entailed.

""Hadiya does not have any idea about Syria, where she wanted to go after converting to Islam,"" he said, adding ""I cannot have a terrorist in the family.""

Ashokan said he was sad that his daughter had to undergo all the unpleasant experiences because of which her studies were interrupted. ""But now I am happy as the court has allowed her to study further,"" Ashokan told reporters in Delhi.

He denied allegations that she had been kept under house arrest and added, ""She was fully surrounded by police inside and outside the house."" Ashokan said he was not worried about her security in Salem as she was now under the protection and observation of the apex court.

""I accept the Supreme Court's decision. She is under the protection of the Supreme Court as it is monitoring the case and so I am not worried about her security,"" he said.

He also said he would go to Salem and meet her as and when necessary as the court had allowed him to do so. ""The court has not given anyone guardianship, including Shafin Jahan, of my child,"" Ashokan said, adding that only close relatives like him were allowed by the court.

The apex court, which yesterday interacted with Hadiya for nearly half-an-hour in the courtroom against the wishes of her father who had sought an in-camera interaction, had directed the Kerala police to provide her security and ensure that she travels at the earliest to Salem to pursue her homeopathy studies.

Election polls often provide a pretty good sense of who’s about to win. But sometimes, what they tell us is simply that the race is too uncertain to make any bets before the votes are counted. The surveys of Tuesday’s special election for Alabama’s next U.S. senator fall squarely in the latter category. Poll aggregation gives scandal-plagued Republican Roy Moore a negligible edge as of Monday. But that’s almost beside the point in a race where, on Monday alone, results ranged from a Fox News survey finding Moore trailing Democrat Doug Jones by 10 percentage points to an Emerson College poll that gave Moore a 9-point lead. The Alabama race is a case study in nearly everything that makes horserace polling tricky. Its mid-December date, and the fact that there’s nothing else on the ballot, means pollsters have relatively little data to guide their assumptions about who’ll turn out to vote. The flurry of sexual misconduct allegations surrounding Moore, and the shifting reactions of national and state Republicans ― the party’s national committee pulled funding for the race, but then reinstated it ― complicate things further. Add in variations in methodology, and the minor wrinkle of write-in votes (which will likely be scant, but which pollsters lack a good way of measuring), and you have a recipe for exactly the kind of volatile spread seen in the polls.

God bless anyone modeling turnout in a (1) special election in a (2) normally safe seat in a (3) nationalized contest that (4) features an anti-establishment primary winner who's (5) accused of creeping malls & molesting young teens but (6) hasn't lost his state party. — Matt Glassman (@MattGlassman312) November 17, 2017

Some of Jones’ best numbers, it’s worth noting, come from pollsters like Fox News and The Washington Post who use live interviewers, rather than the automated calls used by many other survey-takers. The use of live interviewers also allows for direct calls to to cell phones, which automated polls can’t do. (Some pollsters using automated calls, though, attempt to supplement their samples by, for instance, using online panels.) Fox News pollster Dana Blanton noted that the network’s survey found respondents interviewed by cell phone ― a group that tends to be younger and less white than landline users ― favored Jones by a 30-point margin. “The fact that traditional, high-quality probability samples, like the Fox News poll, include both landline and cellphone numbers may be why these polls show Jones doing relatively well compared to automated or blended polls,” she wrote. But it’s also worth noting that, if the 2016 election taught us anything, it’s that “traditional, high-quality” methods aren’t any guarantee of nailing the results. And the difference in mode (live-caller vs. automated calls) could also affect the surveys in other, unexpected ways. It’s not unthinkable that voters in this particular race could be more inclined to conceal their preferences from live interviewers. And more than anything, as the hoary-but-true-political cliche goes, “it all comes out to turnout.”

I'm guessing Moore supporters in Alabama aren't going to want to pick up the phone when pollsters call for a while. Questions is whether they stay home from voting, too. — Ariel Edwards-Levy (@aedwardslevy) November 10, 2017

If turnout looks like a typical off-year election in Alabama, Moore is the favorite to win. If disgruntled or conflicted Republicans end up staying home, or if fired-up Democrats flood to the polls, Jones has a better shot. The problem is in figuring out which scenario is more plausible. Pollsters haven’t been consistent in finding whether Moore or Jones has an advantage among the smaller field of “likely voters” when compared to the entire electorate. Several pollsters have driven home the uncertainty surrounding turnout by taking the still-unusual step of releasing multiple estimates of the race, and by publicly walking through the kinds of choices survey houses face when making sense of the data. The online polling firm SurveyMonkey offered 10 different ways of looking at the same data using different weighting and assumptions about turnout. The results ranged from a 10-point lead for Moore to a 9-point lead for Jones. “We know the actual electorate will be a fraction of all registered voters,” SurveyMonkey’s Mark Blumenthal said. ”[W]e just don’t know how small that fraction will be or who exactly will turn out.” Using self-reported data on whether Alabamians felt they were probable or certain to vote gave Jones a healthy lead. Looking at self-reported data on their voting history favored Moore. On top of all that, SurveyMonkey pollsters noted that in terms of how their sample group voted in last year’s presidential race, Donald Trump only enjoyed an 11-point margin (he carried Alabama by about 28 points). Reweighting the results to match the outcome of 2016 boosted Moore’s numbers ― but it’s far from clear whether doing so is the right call. The group “may indicate either a big underlying Democratic turnout advantage seeping into the response patterns of our respondents, or it may be a sign of sample bias in need of correction,” Blumenthal wrote. “Either way, when combined with the potential for purely random error inherent in all surveys, the findings make a projection of the outcome virtually impossible.”

SurveyMonkey

A second turnout experiment, released Monday by Monmouth University, found a more modest spread, ranging from a 4-point lead for Moore when using a “historical midterm model, akin to Alabama’s 2014 turnout,” to a 3-point edge for Jones when using a “model with higher overall turnout, where voter demographics look more like the 2016 election.” A third model, based on “patterns seen in last month’s Virginia gubernatorial race ― i.e. relatively higher turnout in Democratic strongholds,” found the race tied.

Air pollution exposure has been linked to increases in hospital admissions and deaths from cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and lung cancer. A key culprit is cars, since emissions from gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles are one of the main sources of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and particulates.

“For many people, such as the elderly or those with chronic disease, the only exercise they very often can do is to walk,” Chung said. He said he believes the results of the new study, carried out in London, would be replicable in many North American and European cities. He also said the impacts are likely to apply to other age groups, but further studies are needed on that.

The report calls for stricter air quality limits, better traffic control measures and greater access to green spaces. Chung also said the study indicated individuals should avoid busy, congested areas whenever possible and opt for green spaces instead. He acknowledged that may be hard ― and costly ― for those living or working in inner cities.

“Our hope is that this study will add to the evidence city leaders need to contribute to policies that will encourage preservation of green spaces,” said Jim Zhang, professor of global and environmental health at Duke and study’s co-author.

He added: “As economic growth and urbanization happen around the world, lots of cities are left with very little green space. ... People like outdoor exercise. We should provide them with spaces to enable that instead of giving them no choice but to walk and cycle through busy, polluted streets.”

​Brooke Havlik, communications director for the New York-based nonprofit organization WE ACT for Environmental Justice, said that far from improving the situation, the U.S. is going backward at a federal level when it comes to combatting air pollution.

“The Trump administration and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt are actively working to dismantle critical​ public health and ​clean air protections,” she said.

Poor air quality is creating a public health crisis in the U.S., said Natalie Nava, project leader at the environmental group Greenpeace USA.

She noted that although the Obama administration proposed stronger fuel efficiency standards for vehicles to fight air pollution, since President Donald Trump took office, “car companies have actually been lobbying ... to get these standards rolled back.”

“As long as American automakers drag their feet on fuel standards and other sustainability regulations, they’re showing that they care more about their short-term financial interests than they do about long-term benefits for public health, the planet, and even the economy,” she said.

This was him in 2010.

""Only when women are empowered to thrive; will our families, our economies, and our societies reach their fullest potential,"" Ms Ivanka Trump said while addressing the recently concluded 8th annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), in Hyderabad.

One wonders if her sentiment would resonate with the women who work at India's garment factories - earning just about $100 a month while battling verbal and sexual abuse in mostly hostile workplaces. Many of these women could be stitching cotton tops for her apparel brand.

According to a Washington Post report, a significant percentage of Ivanka Trump's products is manufactured in Asia across factories located in India, China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among others.

In China, the story revealed, factories used by the Ivanka Trump brand not only made its labourers work excessive hours, they were also guilty of several violations including paying labourers salaries below minimum wage in China. Managers also, allegedly, verbally abused several women workers.

Rights activists feel that if Trump actually wants to walk the talk, she should perhaps address the issues related to miserable conditions factory workers -- especially women -- are subjected to.

In the run-up to her recent India visit, The Post carried a story pointing out the mystery shrouding the conditions of labourers - especially women - in the Indian factories that could be manufacturing products for Ivanka Trump's brands.

The report further mentioned G-III -- a large clothing distributor and the manufacturing partner of Ivanka Trump's brand -- recently expanding its base to Bangalore. While there is no direct evidence of labour rights violation by this company in India, the terrible condition of garments workers in Bangalore, with women being the worst hit, is no secret. However, Time magazine had reported, how the there have been allegations of poor working conditions in factories owned by G-III in China.

As per this report, one in every seven women working in the garment industry in the city has been raped or forced into a sexual act at work. In absence of any effective factory-level reparation mechanisms, number of complaints lodged by these women workers is negligible says a report by Scroll.in.

It's quite an irony then that while speaking about women charting their own courses and achieving incredible feats, Trump - who has made women empowerment and economic independence the overriding focus of her political image - seems to have expunged the reality of the women workforce who comprise more than half of India's textile industry labourers.

For a sector that contributes 11% to India's exports and over 5% to the gross domestic product, a majority of garment factory workers earn only minimum wages.

In Bangalore, the monthly wage of over five lakh labourers employed in more than 1,200 factories is just about Rs 7,474 including dearness allowance - an income way below the minimum amount required to sustain a family.

To add to that reports have shown that wage related non-compliance rates in India's garment sector have been higher for women at 74% compared to 45% for men, clearly indicating the gender centric bias.

The Scroll report quotes labour rights advocates stating that the women workers don't have much bargaining power.They are poor, non-unionised, and often the sole breadwinners for their families. Multinational brands largely offer ""narrow margins"" to manufacturers, who then fight to keep service conditions low.

No wonder then, her rhetoric about the Donald Trump administration 'striving to promote greater opportunity for women around the world, both through our domestic reforms and our international initiatives' at the Summit themed ""Women First, Prosperity for All,"" seems like an empty gesture.

If Trump wants the world to find any substance in her #WomenWhoWork declaration, she might as well make some sincere attempts to improve the working conditions of women labourers. Let the first phase of this effort begin in India by revealing the identities of all the factories she partners with in the country, followed by a meticulous investigation of their day to day operations.

We’re at the cusp of a next-generation video offering: YouTube, but with a modern mix of free, paid, and sponsored revenue elements.","On Feb. 14, 2005, three partners gathered at a pizza parlor in San Mateo, Calif. Like most startups, they’d found a problem they wanted to solve. They were making videos with their friends of hanging out at social events, just what kids do — and they had no way to share them. YouTube was born, and user-generated video (UGC) took off like a rocket.

Massive user engagement uploads and views followed. People liked YouTube because it was easy, it was fun, and it was free.

YouTube Jawed Karim: Youtube First famous Video ""me at the zoo""

But behind the scenes, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim had a problem. The server and traffic bills were growing exponentially. Sequoia Capital stemmed the bleeding with at first $3.5 million, and then $8 million.

Just a year and a half after its launch, YouTube was sold to Google for $1.65 billion in stock.

But the costs continued to mushroom, and the looming legal threats from copyright holders hung like a cloud over YouTube’s future. People were uploading movies, music, and all sorts of digital video that made the sharing site popular with copyright scofflaws. Perhaps not surprising, but YouTube would need deep pockets to address it. Viacom filed a billion-dollar lawsuit against Google for copyright infringement in 2007.

And YouTube’s problems have been growing worse by the day for 10 years, creating what is now a massive gap between what video was — television — and what it strives to be: useful, engaging, nichified, targeted motion media delivered by the internet.

So far it’s been an ocean of tears as companies have tried to meet audience demand for relevant video, and been crushed trying to compete with the powerful economics of “free.”

Angel.co lists 5,880 video startups, many more than I need to name here. But here’s just a few you may remember: Revver, Blip.TV, Joost, 5min, Motionbox, Ramp, Pluto TV, Vidyard, Airtime, Daily Motion, Tout, Metacafe and Frequency. 5,880 startups with an average valuation of $4.5 million equals $26.4 billion.

And so every day, when you read about another company “pivoting to video,” it’s worth noting that so far, with the benefit of hindsight, and BILLIONS of dollars spent, no one has made that work — not in technology, content, aggregation, or curation. There are many “at bats” — and so far, all strike-outs.

So what happened, and what’s next?

What Happened?

After Google purchased YouTube, the search giant set out to bring its powerful and successful AdSense offering to long-tail video. YouTube had the videos, it had the creators — now it just needed to get the AdWords economic engine to point its efforts at video.

Google tried with any number of products, but the model didn’t translate. Text ads were easy to make, low-cost to place, and understandable. Video ads, even with a number of self-serve tools, just didn’t catch fire. Google was a public company (since August 2004) and as such needed to find big opportunities that could generate big new sources of revenue.

Madison Avenue — with its coffers full of brand advertising spend — wasn’t about to buy into Google’s UGC YouTube offering.

“We are in the advertising business,” Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO, told The New Yorker back in 2008. The purchase of DoubleClick for $3.1 billion made clear that Google was going to buy its way into the swank private clubhouse of brand advertising.

The company’s mission back in 2008 was “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Making information accessible takes on the established makers and publishers of media, whose raison d’être is to own and distribute content.

So today 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. But the vast majority of that video doesn’t meet the rather stringent requirements of big brand advertisers. And as long-tail video advertising hasn’t really showed up, YouTube is in the complicated spot of being both a disrupter of web video, and a net loser of revenue.

Statisticbrain.com reports that the annual cost of running and maintaining YouTube is $6.3 billion, while the annual revenue generated from YouTube is $4 billion. That’s a loss of more than $2 billion dollars. And before you think that Google partners are the big winners in this equation, Statisticbrain notes that the average YouTube partner earns just 32 cents per 5,000 views — or a CPM of .064. Those numbers sting.

Wondering how this works, I asked an insider at Google if the company ever considers abandoning the free YouTube upload business to start charging for users whose videos weren’t monetizable (which is most of them). The answer? “Sure, we talk about it, but then we realize our comScore numbers would plummet, and we leave things as they are.”

So, here we are. Video uploads are free. Anyone who charges for video services has to compete with Google. And even as video becomes the format of choice for both advertisers and consumers in the mobile web, finding business models for creators and networks seems like a distant mirage in the desert.

What’s Next?

We’re at the cusp of a next-generation video offering: YouTube, but with a modern mix of free, paid, and sponsored revenue elements. Video makers and uploaders are pushing at the edges of the one-size-fits-all thinking that has made YouTube the upload site of choice.

With strategic focus, Facebook has made uploads to its platform the preferential way for display video for its 2.07 billion monthly active users. LinkedIn has rolled out a somewhat limited video upload offering. Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram all now invite uploads. And Amazon, with its massive AWS infrastructure, has taken a cautious step into video uploads with Amazon Video Direct, though ironically it requires an .srt subtitle file, and recommends using the YouTube automated transcription tool to create the lower third text.

Remember:

Video isn’t free to make.

Video isn’t free to store.

Video isn’t free to deliver.

As long as YouTube continues to rely on its big brother Google’s ad revenue to underwrite its video losses, the video space is stuck, unable to connect revenues, audiences and makers.

Just around the corner, there is a new generation online video platform that provides a flexible, fast, multi-platform solution to turns video’s many speed bumps into an economic SaaS solution. Upload once, publish to many platforms — and pay with either advertising avails or a service fee.","How YouTube 'Free' Killed Video, And What Comes Next",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-youtube-free-killed-video-and-what-comes-next_us_5a14401fe4b010527d6780a4?section=us_technology

The end of the year is a good time for small and midsize business owners who benefit from U.S. consumers’ holiday spending spree. Twenty percent of the annual revenues the average small and midsize business earns comes in between Thanksgiving and Dec. 31, the second national SMB & Money Survey reports.

For companies that sell products, this time of year is even more profitable; they earn an average of 28 percent of their annual revenues at year-end.

But it’s not all good news, according to the survey, which was conducted by Survata for WePay. More than 70 percent of the business owners surveyed say they faced at least one serious business problem during last year’s holiday season, the most common being late payments.

More than 21 percent of small and midsize businesses surveyed struggled with late payments between Thanksgiving and Dec. 31, 2016. What’s more, over two-thirds of those surveyed say at least 10 percent of their customers fail to pay on time.

Cash crunch

When your business doesn’t get paid on time, it not only puts a major crimp in your cash flow, but it also eats up valuable time you could be spending on more important things. Nearly six in 10 business owners in the survey say they have to follow up at least twice to get late-paying customers to meet their obligations.

Even small business owners who get paid immediately at the point of purchase, such as retailers and e-commerce businesses, struggle with their own financial issues during year-end. More than one-fourth (26 percent) of respondents say they lost money to fraud or chargebacks (disputed charges) in the last 12 months; 22 percent of those lost $5,000 or more. Making matters worse, if you have too many chargebacks, you may run into problems with your payment processing company.

Protect yourself

If you don’t want to be one of these statistics, it’s important to take steps to protect your business. Here are some tips to reduce chargebacks:

Analyze the reasons behind your chargebacks. Chargebacks can be caused by credit card fraud, such as stolen cards, or by “friendly fraud,” in which customers order products online and then claim they never received them and ask for a refund. If your website doesn’t provide accurate, detailed product descriptions, you may also end up with a high number of chargebacks from dissatisfied customers when the products aren’t what they expected.

Maintain proper website security and follow the payment processing protocols recommended by your payment processing company.

Make sure the descriptor (the business name that appears in customers’ credit card statements) is recognizable as your business. When customers don’t recognize a descriptor, they often assume they’ve been charged in error and dispute the charge.

For sales transacted in person, always check the customer’s identification and make sure that the signature on the credit card matches their signature.

If your problem is late payers, the best defense is being proactive. Follow these tips to get your customers to pay on time:

Send invoices immediately upon delivery of products or services. Use electronic payment acceptance and online invoicing to speed things up.

Make sure you send your invoices to the correct address, department, and individual.

Design invoices that are easy to read and clearly state the amount due, due date and how to pay.

Follow up with customers as soon as a payment is late. The faster you act, the more likely you are to get paid before the year is up.

For customers that consistently pay late, you’ll have to consider whether it’s worth continuing to do business with them. If you decide to keep working with late payers, institute policies to protect your business such as requiring cash on delivery or partial payment upfront.

Financial issues can quickly spiral into ongoing cash shortages that can destroy your business. Whether your money problems spring from chargebacks, fraud, or late-paying customers, take steps to get them under control before year-end.

Victim B told HuffPost she never expected Yeatman to say such a thing and was left stunned.
She said she didn’t intend to identify herself as an alleged victim until Yeatman said higher-ups at Netflix didn’t believe Masterson’s accusers.","One of actor Danny Masterson’s alleged sexual assault victims says a Netflix executive told her this weekend that higher-ups at the company don’t believe the four women who have accused Masterson of rape. Netflix confirmed in a statement that Andy Yeatman, its director of global kids content, made those “careless” and “uninformed” comments, but noted that he was not initially aware that the woman he was speaking to had accused Masterson of rape. Masterson stars in the Netflix program “The Ranch,” alongside his former “That ’70s Show” co-star Ashton Kutcher (“That ’70s Show” is also streaming on Netflix). Although four women have accused Masterson of raping them and the Los Angeles County District Attorney and Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the allegations, Netflix has not taken any action against the actor, not even a suspension pending investigation. The lack of action on Netflix’s part ― even though the company moved quickly to suspend and then fire Kevin Spacey after BuzzFeed published a report detailing an allegation of sexual misconduct against the actor ― has led to outrage on Twitter, an online petition that had gained over 36,000 signatures by Monday morning, and a Daily Beast story titled “Netflix’s Disturbing Sexual-Assault Hypocrisy.”

Victim B told HuffPost she never expected Yeatman to say such a thing and was left stunned. She said she then told him, “I’m one of them.”

Yeatman spoke with the woman, whom HuffPost is referring to as Victim B, on the sidelines of a kids’ soccer game in Los Angeles. Yeatman is the head coach of a soccer team for 8- and 9-year-old girls. Victim B’s husband is the head coach of the team that played against Yeatman’s on Sunday. Their respective daughters play on the teams that their fathers coach. When Victim B approached Yeatman and asked him if he worked at Netflix, she says he answered in the affirmative. Victim B said she asked Yeatman why Netflix was not taking action against Masterson in light of the district attorney’s investigation and the multiple accusations of rape. According to Victim B and another witness, Yeatman said Netflix takes sexual misconduct allegations seriously but that “we don’t believe them,” referring to Masterson’s four accusers. Victim B told HuffPost she never expected Yeatman to say such a thing and was left stunned. She said she then told him, “I’m one of them,” indicating she was one of Masterson’s accusers. The conversation ended quickly. Victim B said Yeatman approached her at the game about an hour later, ostensibly to clear the air, and told her that he’d had no idea she was one of Masterson’s alleged victims. Victim B told HuffPost that she began to cry and told Yeatman, “I hope no one ever says that to your daughter.” Yeatman then told her that he can’t decide whether Netflix takes action against Masterson. Victim B told Yeatman that she and the other women accusing Masterson of rape were telling the truth and that “Netflix is going to regret this, this is a mistake, they’re going to see.” Victim B said, and the witness confirmed, that Yeatman said, in what they described as a condescending tone, “we’ll see.” A Netflix spokesman denied that Yeatman said “we’ll see.” But the company confirmed in a statement that Yeatman told Victim B that Netflix executives didn’t believe the four women accusing Masterson of rape. “While he was coaching a youth soccer match today, Mr. Yeatman ― a Netflix kids’ programming executive ― was approached by a stranger who did not identify herself or explain her connection to Danny Masterson,” the statement read. “Mr. Yeatman’s comments were careless, uninformed and do not represent the views of the company. Further, he would have no insights into decision making on The Ranch. We are aware of the allegations against Danny Masterson and we are following the current investigation, and will respond if developments occur.”

Victim B said she initially approached Yeatman when she found out from her husband that he was a Netflix executive. Frustrated by the silence from Netflix on the Masterson issue, she said she hoped he could provide some direction. She said she didn’t intend to identify herself as an alleged victim until Yeatman said higher-ups at Netflix didn’t believe Masterson’s accusers. Victim B noted that she had seen Yeatman in the past at other soccer games and that her husband knew him from previous games. Lilly Yeatman, the wife of Andy Yeatman, sent an email to the husband of Victim B after this piece was initially published, saying Victim B “has really done a terrible thing to a great guy” and that her husband “is terribly sad and heartbroken for any woman who has been hurt or mistreated.” The email, which Victim B provided to HuffPost, was sent from Lilly Yeatman’s professional email address at Disney.

Victim B

Neither Disney nor Lilly Yeatman immediately responded to a request for comment. Masterson has been the subject of an almost year-long investigation conducted by the LAPD and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. Four women have accused Masterson of violently raping them in the early 2000s. They have told law enforcement that they believe Masterson spiked their drinks with something that led them to black out before and during the alleged rapes. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said that the encounters in question were consensual. An attorney for the actor denied that Masterson ever placed any drugs in someone else’s drink and said that as a Scientologist, Masterson has a strict anti-drug policy for himself and for guests in his home.

Sources in the police department and district attorney’s office have described the evidence against Masterson as “compelling” and “overwhelming.”",Netflix Exec Tells Woman The Company Doesn’t Believe Actor’s Rape Accusers.

I'm still not surprised by Donald Trump's disgraceful performance in office. By the time he was elected it was clear how dishonest, corrupt, bigoted, incompetent, and just plain vile he is. What is dismaying is how many Republicans -- in Congress, in his administration, and across the country -- are willing to tolerate this sick behavior to get what they want. They should be treating Trump like a sad, irrelevant Humpty Dumpty egg on a throne, and work with the Democrats to address the challenges facing middle-class, working Americans. But they don't care about any of that.

Now the Senate has passed a disgraceful tax bill, with 51 of 52 GOP senators voting yes. The bill not only validates the presidency of an unfit, malevolent should-not-be-president; it also transfers billions from the middle class to the ultra-rich, meaning Donald Trump himself, and the biggest Republican donors. This was, in many ways, the worst moment so far in an ugly year for America.

Trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with disrespect for constitutional values, know-nothing ignorance, serious bigotry, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy.

Permanent spoiler alert: We can’t imagine anyone other than Donald Trump, Sr., ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. But we won’t get tired of him winning. Believe me.

10. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), chair, Senate Finance Committee. Last week’s ranking: ―

Hatch whined and complained every time Senate Democrats tried to bring the truth into his committee's tax bill debate. Most things he says of substance are first whispered, loud enough for us all to hear, by an aide into Hatch's ear. She apparently wasn't around to whisper when Hatch this week told MSNBC that, as presidents go, Trump is “one of the best I’ve served under.”

9. Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury. Last week’s ranking: ―

Mnuchin kept claiming that his Treasury Department was preparing for release a full analysis of the tax bill. But that didn't happen, and Senator Elizabeth Warren rightly asked Treasury’s inspector general to investigate whether the Secretary acted improperly. I'm sure Mnuchin, worth hundreds of millions himself, and tax-conscious wife Louise won't care what the IG says, because they're gonna make millions more from this deal.

8. Susan Collins, United States Senator (R-ME). Last week’s ranking ―

Next election, Collins will likely get many of the votes of the billionaires in Maine. No one else should vote for her.

7. Apple, Google, Facebook, Uber, and other tech giants. Last week’s ranking: ―

The big tech companies want us to believe they're cool, and that they're kinda on our side against Trump. But they lobbied hard to pass a Republican tax bill that gives them numerous ways to get more money, while their customers, and people who can't afford their services, will pay more money.

6. General Michael Flynn (US Army-Retired), former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Last week’s ranking: ―

Decent folk may now see Flynn as our potential new best friend - yay. But Flynn has now admitted that while serving as the president's national security advisor, he lied to FBI agents. And he's done a lot of other dishonest, corrupt things in the past few years. Luckily the people he may be informing on to Robert Mueller are just as disgraceful.

5. John McCain, United States Senator (R-AZ). Last week’s ranking: ―

Sometimes it looks like McCain is a man of great integrity. But given all the times he's voted for dishonest, predatory special interests, it seems more likely that what motivates him sometimes to take a bold stand is just spite. He's not a saint; he's a troll.

4. Charles and David Koch, billionaires. Last week’s ranking: ―

They are getting almost everything they want from the Trump administration -- huge tax breaks, greater leeway to pollute and overheat the planet. Which isn't surprising, because administration heavyweights like Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, Don McGahn, Marc Short, and Scott Pruitt have long been their paid stooges. Worse, the Kochs have helped fund the ugly Project Veritas sting/deceptive editing operation.

3. Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States. Last week’s ranking: 9

Robert Mueller already has the evidence -- it's right in front of our eyes -- to nail Trump for obstruction of justice, and he may be closing in on collusion with Russia as well. That's good. But if that happens, we may be stuck with this Koch stooge / religious fundamentalist / regular liar as president for quite a while. Awesome.

2. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, and Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House. Last week’s ranking: 4

McConnell and Ryan know Trump is disgusting, but they're getting psyched about standing by his side as the most disgraceful tax bill ever written becomes law. The pair are living monuments to Washington as a corrupt swamp; the men who make the GOP -- and thus our federal government in 2017 -- a purely pay-to-play operation, where rich individual and corporate donors can buy whatever policy they want in exchange for campaign donations and the promise of future revolving door jobs. Bonus points for circulating a supposed economists' letter -- later highlighted on Twitter by Trump -- endorsing the tax bill; the letter's signers included a possibly nonexistent person, a non-economist office assistant, and a convicted forger.

1. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Last week’s ranking: Are you serious?

Our tax victor president is a vile piece of garbage. You already know the details from this lowest of weeks.

Instead of honoring the World War II Navajo Code Talkers, Trump insulted them with a painting of Indian Killer Andrew Jackson and a slur employed to randomly attack Senator Warren.

Trump reportedly is now telling people that the Access Hollywood tape, for which he directly apologized last year, may be fake, and that the Obama birth hoax, which he disgracefully perpetrated before recanting, may again be real. He also reportedly has pressured senators to drop the Russia probe.

Trump poison tweeted in advance of his government shutdown meeting with Chuck and Nancy, thus killing the meeting. Maybe, as has been hinted, Trump did it on purpose because he likes the idea of a shutdown. Or maybe it's more proof that he just doesn't understand the, um, art of the deal.

Trump sent avowed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau-hater Mick Mulvaney down the street to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Trump tweet-attacked CNN International as fake, imperiling the safety of journalists and of people whose struggles are highlighted by CNN global reporting.

Trump retweeted sketchy anti-Muslim videos distributed by a racist, xenophobic U.K. group. He ratcheted up support for the bigoted accused child molester Roy Moore, while weighing in like a gossip blog on the scandals of others. His insane bluster regarding North Korea has totally backfired.

And Trump falsely told an audience in Missouri that the tax bill ""is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me."" We all learned long ago that while nearly everything Trump says is a lie, you can be sure it's a lie when he adds his signature assurance, ""believe me.""

Trump is again number one — the most disgraceful figure in the Trump administration. Trump is not merely a disgrace; he’s a total and complete disgrace.

And these companies’ response to it thus far has been deeply inadequate.

But lost among the outrage is the damage that has been done to the communities targeted by the false and bigoted content. In short, the Russian social media content took an already toxic election campaign and made it far worse.

It is no coincidence that Russians used anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, anti-Latino, anti-LGBT, anti-Muslim, and anti-black messages to stoke divisions, since candidates were already stoking them.

This is not just a crisis for marginalized communities. It is a crisis for our democracy.

According to Facebook’s testimony earlier this month before the Senate Committee on Intelligence, at least 126 million Americans—or more than one-third of the country—were exposed to this Russian content. That means millions more people than we realized were exposed to the falsehoods and hyperbole that are being used as the rationale for the immigration polices the Trump administration pursued.

And the Russians joined the many homegrown actors online already peddling this corrosive content. In other words, communities of color have been fighting a tidal wave of misinformation with a bucket.

This is not just a crisis for marginalized communities, it is a crisis for our democracy. And it is far past time for the tech companies involved to treat it as such.

That is why it is so dismaying to us that for months these companies dismissed these concerns as overblown, even though they have been aware of the dangerous use of their platforms for a long time. While they have pledged to “do better,” they have been woefully short on specifics. And we are most concerned that they have yet to fully acknowledge their role in giving bigots both credibility and a platform beyond their wildest dreams.

These companies have to address this crisis with concrete specifics. We know that companies are wary of solutions that could restrict free speech, but there is nothing against creating more speech.

Social media companies must work with organizations representing affected communities on how to most effectively counter hate speech on their platforms. The companies should provide the opportunity, the resources and the training to help these organizations create and disseminate this content.

There is something to be said for fighting hate speech with better speech and falsehoods with facts. We want to see tech companies adhere to the kind of accountability and transparency that is the hallmark of companies that practice sound corporate responsibility.

But ultimately, the failure to fully see or acknowledge the impact on Latinos and other communities of color points to another longstanding issue—the profound lack of diversity in Silicon Valley.

The Russian crisis underscores why diversity matters. A more diverse workforce could have helped these companies understand the deep impact of what was happening online. And that includes taking demonstrable and quantifiable steps to not only diversify the pipeline of potential new employees, but also their current workforce, leadership and boards of directors.

The issue of diversity in tech has been raised for years, by us and a host of other organizations, elected officials, and leaders. And while the companies have been very open to dialogue and most have made steps in the right direction, the results are dismal.

In 2014, 4 percent of Facebook employees were Latino; today it is just 5 percent. For Twitter and Google, it was 3 percent in 2014, and is only 4 percent currently. At the highest and decision-making levels for all companies, those percentages plummet even further.

Polls show that the vast majority of Americans believe diversity is one of America’s greatest strengths. These companies need to decide whether they will be a party to the erosion of that cherished value, or if they will do what it takes to both prevent the use of their platforms to destroy the ties that bind us as Americans.",Lack Of Diversity In Tech Makes It Difficult To Override Russian Fake News,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lack-of-diversity-in-tech-makes-it-difficult-to-override_us_5a0b343be4b006523921843a?section=us_technology

JK Rowling, one of the internet's sanest voices, a writer who has consistently been a vociferous champion of women's rights and social equality, recently broke her silence on a controversy that has shadowed her for a while now – the casting of Johnny Depp as Grindelwald in Warner Brothers' Fantastic Beasts series.

For those not in the know, in 2016, Depp's personal life took a tumultuous turn as his then wife, actress Amber Heard, accused him of physically and verbally abusing her during the course of their nearly 4-year-long relationship. In May 2016, she filed for divorce, even providing photographic evidence of physical assault, after Depp struck her face with a cellphone.

Heard's friend, iO Tillet Wright, who witnessed the violence first-hand, in an essay for Refinery 29, wrote, 'The reports of violence started with a kick on a private plane, then it was shoves and the occasional punch, until finally, in December, she (Heard) described an all-out assault and she woke up with her pillow covered in blood. I know this because I went to their house. I saw the pillow with my own eyes. I saw the busted lip and the clumps of hair on the floor.""

In her sworn court declaration, Heard stated, ""Johnny has a long-held and widely-acknowledged public and private history of drug and alcohol abuse. He has a short fuse. He is often paranoid and his temper is extremely scary for me as it has proven many times to be physically dangerous and/or life-threatening to me.""

The Los Angeles judge hearing the case found the evidence compelling enough to grant Heard a restraining order against Depp.

After their divorce, Heard and Depp issued a statement, which Heard re-posted after Rowling' wrote her defense of Depp.

After Heard's claims dominated the news cycle, Potter fans expressed genuine concern about the casting of Depp in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Rowling, until now, had maintained a stoic silence on the matter even as her Twitter feed was cluttered with fans expressing a desire to get him removed. Rowling never said a word. In fact, when one Twitter user, @hobbitlindsey, questioned Depp's participation in the movies and Rowling's silence on the controversy, she was blocked by the author, a rather uncharacteristic move.

As someone who has never shied away from engaging politically (she was a vocal critic of Brexit and routinely calls out Trump) or shaming sexist trolls, haters, bigots, xenophobes, and body-shamers, Rowling's meek defense of Depp is uniquely disappointing, convenient and inconsistent with her fiercely liberal and progressive worldview.

Here's Rowling's complete statement:

JK Rowling's statement on Johnny Depp's inclusion in the Fantastic Beasts series.

As we've seen, in a post-Weinstein era, there's a significantly higher consciousness of the effects and implications of male violence and sexual abuse. At least in the entertainment industry, (Al Franken may have grudgingly resigned but don't forget accused paedophile Roy Moore is still running for Senate and Donald Trump is still the President of the United States), there's a legitimate reckoning as more and more women come forward to share stories of abuse and an increasing number of powerful men face very real consequences for their past actions.

In that context, Rowling's statement, where she asserts that she's 'not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies' is a massive setback for what feels like a legitimate and much-needed revolution. When she says, she's 'genuinely happy' with her choice, she has chosen to disbelieve a woman who suffered violently at Depp's hands. When she selectively quotes Heard on having expressed a desire to 'move on,' she's consciously ignoring the part where Heard wrote that 'neither party made false accusations.'

It's one thing to call out perpetuators of abuse when there's nothing personally at stake, but quite another when there are serious financial as well as social ramifications.

It's one thing to call out perpetuators of abuse when there's nothing personally at stake, but quite another when there are serious financial as well as social ramifications. The women who came forward to share their stories risked all of that, and much more, and Rowling's support of Depp belittles their courage and insidiously stifles their collective voices.

It also delegitimizes their struggle.

Rowling, in the past, has made her position clear on Weinstein, although not directly.

On 11 October, she quote tweeted a tweet from Trump's Former Deputy Assistant, Sebastian Gorka, where he said, 'THINK: If Weinstein had obeyed @VP Pence's rules for meeting with the opposite sex, none of those poor women would ever have been abused.'

(Pence's rules for meeting with women is to never do it alone)

Rowling responded to it, saying, ""If the only thing preventing a man committing sexual assault is the presence of witnesses, he's too dangerous to be at liberty.""

But calling out a sexual predator when there are no real financial or legal consequence to you is far easier than calling out an abuser, whose inclusion or exclusion, directly affects your economic advancement.

Times such as these are the true test of how far you can go to defend your ideals and more importantly, how consistent your actions are with your projected ideals. A moral dilemma such as the one Rowling faced -- to choose between perceived commercial gains or take an ethical stand -- reveals if she believes in championing causes or it's mere lip-service/a PR exercise.

Today, Rowling is in a position of power, where she can influence the decision of a mammoth studio to get Depp dropped and replaced with another, a more credible A-lister – if that's one of the reasons to continue having him in the film. By doing so, she could've set perhaps the most solid example, after Kevin Spacey's firing from one of Netflix's top-performing show, House of Cards, and emboldened the efforts of several hundred women who still fear calling out their aggressors for the fear of sabotaging their careers.

And if Netflix can act, why can't Warner Bros? And it's not just Netflix, it's a whole lot of corporate giants who're part of the awakening.

In an unprecedented move, Sony allowed Ridley Scott to reshoot the Kevin Spacey-starrer All The Money in the World after the film was fully complete. NBC fired top-ratings drawer, Today show host Matt Lauer, Amazon dropped its studio head, Roy Price. HBO has cut all ties with Louis CK. (Here's a list of at least 40 men who've lost their jobs/resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct came about).

Why should Depp be absolved of his transgressions and continue to be recruited in top projects? Especially when the degree of his transgressions is much severe, the timing of the event recent, and the the evidence, overwhelmingly clear?

We need men to lose.

We need men to realise that there are consequences, economic, social, legal and otherwise. Society doesn't owe these men rehabilitation, that's their and their battle alone. And what it definitely doesn't need to do -- like Rowling's decision quite actively has -- is to enable their economic advancement and contribute in refurbishing their image by consciously glossing over their very serious moral and potentially legal offenses.

Now, more than ever before, we need this reckoning to continue. To win. To validate the difficult truths of all those women who suppressed traumatic memories with unimaginable courage and risked re-traumatization by choosing to open up.

And Rowling, along with us, let them down too.

It's deeply wounding to be disappointed by somebody you've idolized. It not only saddens you, it thwarts your little reservoir of idealism. It's disenchanting when your heroes leave you with a profound sense of betrayal. But perhaps we need to shift our idea of what constitutes a hero, just like we have of what definitely doesn't constitute one.

A hero cannot be a projected version of our collective fantasies, who we, as hopeful followers and worshippers of literature and cinema, put on a pedestal they never signed up to be put on.

A hero cannot be an armchair hashtag activist.

A hero has to be one who champions causes, uses all the tools available to them to enable social change, and calls out a bully, a harasser, a predator, even if it comes at a commercial disadvantage.

For a writer who made an incredible career by authoring a story about a boy who survived abuse, it's heartbreaking to see Rowling defend a man, who, in all likelihood, perpetuated it.

For all its magic, the Harry Potter universe, primarily, is built on the premise of standing up to bullies.

Sadly, it's author today is complicit in encouraging one.

As the great wizard Dumbledore once said, ""Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.""

For now, we know the choice Rowling made. It's a choice she'll have to live with.

I am the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board till 2020 and I will keep calling for the Ram Temple.
Jawad has branded Rizvi's intervention in the Ayodhya dispute as just another attempt to cover up corruption in the Shia Waqf Board.","LUCKNOW, Uttar Pradesh -- There is a fairly good chance that you have not heard of Syed Waseem Rizvi from Old Lucknow – a most sympathetic champion of the campaign to build the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

The mild-mannered Shia Muslim may not have exploded onto the national scene like the blustering Shri Rajput Karni Sena, but in Uttar Pradesh, the Muslim community finds itself obsessing over the 48-year-old chairman of the UP Shia Waqf Board, the body which looks after Shia properties in the state.

Once the blue-eyed boy of Samajwadi Party's Muslim firebrand Azam Khan, both Rizvi and his mentor were looking down the barrel of a federal investigation after the BJP came to power in UP earlier this year and accused them of corruption in their handling of Waqf properties. Waqf refers to properties donated for a religious or charitable cause that cannot be transferred or sold.

Suddenly, the heat is off. Instead of fretting about a CBI probe, Rizvi has been meeting with influential men like Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar to discuss ways and means of resolving the contentious Babri Masjid–Ram Janmabhoomi dispute. Not surprisingly, they all see building the Ram Temple in Ayodhya as the only way forward.

In a strange twist to an already tragic story, 25 years after hundreds of kar sevaks demolished the Babri Masjid, a Muslim has emerged as a messiah for the Hindu nationalists bent on building the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

Undaunted by a volley of criticism from both Sunni and Shia leaders, Rizvi has proven himself to be more loyal than the king when it comes to bashing the Sunni Muslim litigants in the title suit of the Babri Masjid, now in the final hearing stage before the Supreme Court.

While the Waqf board chairman has no qualms about disregarding the history of sectarian violence in his hometown, Hindu nationalists have found someone to say the things from which even they must refrain.

In its affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in August, the Shia Waqf Board said, ""It is submitted that the Sunni Central Waqf Board U.P. is under the dominant control of Sunni hardliners, the fanatics and non-believers in peaceful co-existence, who have no stake in the present case...""

While addressing a press conference in Delhi, last month, Rizvi said that Pakistan was funding the UP Sunni Waqf Board, the Muslim litigant in the legal dispute.

In a recent conversation with HuffPost India, Rizvi repeated the allegation but offered no proof. In addition to recalling that Pakistan had seen huge demonstrations on 6 December, 1992, the Shia Waqf Board chairman said, ""The Sunni Board cannot pay its members but it can hire expensive lawyers like Kapil Sibal. How do you explain it?""

When I pointed out that he might be toying with the fragile calm that prevailed between Sunnis and Shiites after a century of bloodshed in Lucknow, Rizvi said, ""What is more important, Shia-Sunni unity or Hindu-Muslim unity?""

""I suppose the Shia-Sunni problems in the Middle East and Pakistan are also my fault. Shia and Sunni have fought since the beginning. Even to make peace in Lucknow, it was the Shia who compromised. Is that real peace?"" he continued.

What is more important, Shia-Sunni unity or Hindu-Muslim unity?

More than words

Rizvi's recent interventions mark the first time that anyone has attempted a sectarian divide over the Babri Masjid since 1946, when a civil court in Faizabad ruled that the 16th century mosque belonged to the Sunni community.

In November, a month before the final hearing was to commence in the Supreme Court, the Shia Waqf Board moved the Supreme Court against its Sunni counterpart, claiming that the Babri Masjid had always belonged to the Shiite because its architect and Mughal commander Mir Baqi was Shia.

Not only did the Shia Waqf Board force itself into the interminable litigation going back half-a-century, Rizvi welcomed Hindus to build their Ram Temple on the disputed site. He even asked the BJP-run state government for land to build a ""mosque of peace"" in Lucknow, over 100 kilometers from Ayodhya.

Rizvi told me, ""The only way to resolve the dispute is to build the Ram Temple. Will the Muslims ever be able to build a mosque in the old spot? No, never. So why not give millions of Hindus what they have desired for so long? Why not end the dispute and make peace?""

The only way to resolve the dispute is to build the Ram Temple.

While ratcheting up the rhetoric against the Sunnis, Rizvi has also managed to orchestrate a major turnaround in his own declining fortune. The Waqf Board chairman told me that he had a ""good"" meeting with the chief minister, but he vehemently denied trying to appease the BJP.

""Even the Samajwadi Party had false corruption cases against me. In fact, the Akhilesh government was worse. They slapped six FIRs against me and dissolved the Waqf Board. The Supreme Court stayed it. This year, the BJP sacked six members of the Waqf Board but the Allahabad High Court stayed it. I am fighting each and every allegation and winning because the truth is on my side.""

Despite the host of allegations against him and no dearth of powerful enemies, Rizvi has by some miracle managed to get elected as chairman of the Shia Waqf Board four times.

While his friends joke that a lucky star is shining on him, Rizvi attributes it to his ""life experience"" working as a cook in Saudi Arabia, a salesman in America, and making carburetors in a factory in Japan.

""I am the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board till 2020 and I will keep calling for the Ram Temple,"" he said. ""Let the entire Muslim community stand on one side. I will stand on the other side.""

The timing seems most convenient. Ten years since he first became the chairman, his enthusiasm for the Ram Temple peaked only after the BJP came to power and accused him of corruption.

To the question, ""Why now?"", he replied, ""Well, why not.""

I am the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board till 2020 and I will keep calling for the Ram Temple.

Shia divided

The Shiites, who make up just 10 to 15 percent of the Muslim population in India, have from time to time backed Hindu nationalist forces like the BJP. In the 2014 general election, for instance, the Shiites backed Narendra Modi, but in the UP Assembly election in 2012, they backed the Samajwadi Party and in the state polls this year, it was Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party.

On the Babri Masjid, however, the Shiites have stood behind the Sunni since independence. After the BJP came to power in UP this year, a few cracks have appeared. In addition to their political loyalties and ideological convictions, longstanding personal rivalries have also pitted Shia leaders against each other and fashioned their response to the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute.

Take, for instance, the revered Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, who, while sharing the stage with yoga guru Baba Ramdev in August, told Muslims, ""If you give this one plot, you will win crores of hearts.""

Sadiq was immediately opposed by his own nephew, Maulana Kalbe Jawad, the most powerful religious leader in the Shia community, who has for years led an agitation against the Shia Waqf Board and its chairman.

In a past life, before they both rose to hold public positions, Jawad and Rizvi had played carrom together. Rizvi told me that he used to play cricket with Jawad's nephew. But for years now, the mualana has been accusing Rizvi for raking in crores by illegally selling Waqf properties, and Rizvi has accused the Shia cleric of making millions by selling burial spots in graveyards.

Jawad has branded Rizvi's intervention in the Ayodhya dispute as just another attempt to cover up corruption in the Shia Waqf Board.

If you give this one plot, you will win crores of hearts.

DOUGLAS E. CURRAN/AFP/Getty Images Hindu fundamentalists attack the wall of the 16th century Babri Masjid Mosque with iron rods in the city of Ayodhya.

Advantage BJP

It suits the Hindu nationalists just fine to have the Shia leaders fighting amongst themselves and exchanging barbs with the Sunnis in the media over the Babri Masjid, giving rise to the perception of a divided Muslim community.

Perception is vital for the Hindutva camp.

Rizvi's intervention bolsters the Hindu nationalists who would have you believe that the vast majority of Muslims are in favor of relenting and only the radicalized section persists in hurting Hindu sentiments. Meanwhile, couching the anti-mosque campaign in terms such a ""peace"" and ""winning hearts"" helps create a mahaul (atmosphere) which forces the Muslims to settle.

In reality, Rizvi and the nine members of the Waqf board are only custodians of the Shia properties, not representatives of the community. And they have all been roundly criticized by both Shia and Sunni leaders. But these subtleties are lost in the carefully crafted clamor.

Religious leaders of both sects are shocked at just how much publicity Rizvi has received. His detractors were confident of him being dismissed as a troublemaker right off the bat but contrary to their expectations, major newspapers and new channels have been carrying his controversial remarks for the better part of the year. His meeting with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar garnered tremendous attention.

Rizvi insists that he is speaking truth to power. ""It is high time that the matter was resolved. Muslims want to end the dispute with Hindus. The Sunnis must listen,"" he said.

It doesn't bother Rizvi if his involvement in the Ayodhya dispute is short-lived.

When I asked him his plans if the Supreme Court rejected the Shia Waqf Board's claim as the Faizabad court had done in 1946, Rizvi said, ""I will accept it. But I have spoken the truth and people will remember it.""

The Grammys have been under fire for their lack of diversity over the years, so an absence of white men in the top category this year could signify a sea change in the organization. Last year, the Grammys snubbed two artists of color ― Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar ― for Album of the Year, instead favoring white female artists Adele and Taylor Swift. Many noted the enormity of Beyonce’s work in “Lemonade” and Lamar’s in “To Pimp A Butterfly.” Adele herself even expressed concern over her win, saying of Beyonce, “What the fuck does she have to do to win album of the year? That’s how I feel.”

@kendricklamar was snubbed. Out of the nominees, ""To Pimp A Butterfly"" was the superior album. Then again, the Grammys rarely get it right. February 16, 2016

Fans have also been asking another awards institution ― the Academy ― to increase diversity of nominees. At the Academy Awards in both 2015 and 2016, all 20 actors nominated in the lead and supporting acting categories were white (which, as USA Today noted, hadn’t happened since 1998). The lack of diversity sparked outrage in the form of a trending Twitter hashtag, #OscarsSoWhite, and many celebrities boycotted the show altogether. It’s not clear if the Recording Academy voting members, which determine the final nominations for the Grammys, considered last year’s fan feedback in making this year’s choices.

When it comes to setting business goals, don’t settle for “doable”","Why New Year goals for business are best thought out over the holidays

Why set goals in these turbulent times?

You can’t underestimate the importance of organizational goals — especially in turbulent times. Goals set and measured are goals achieved and treasured. And achieving meaningful annual goals requires setting a high bar, well in advance. December is a great time to do that.

I know that after a long year, and during the home stretch to the holidays, it’s easy to get stuck in reactive mode, and to tell yourself you’ll think about goals “later.” Don’t! End-of-year/start-of-new-year goals and resolutions are just what the doctor ordered. They refocus us on the big picture, and reconnect us with our ideals. They energize us.

Case in point: Recently, I completed a series of CEO calls focused on goal-setting, as part of my executive coaching practice. The process was as illuminating as it was invigorating — so I wanted to share the exercises we went through together.

My hope is that they will help you make the most of the season: get out of our default-reactive mode… and raise the bar on your proactive goal-setting mode for 2018. Because, once in place, your short list of business goals and objectives will seriously increase your odds for success by helping you and your team focus on what’s really important — and tune out the rest.

Setting business goals: Make it real and keep it simple — and achievable

No matter what, or whom, you lead, the first rule in setting goals is to assume that your organization’s existence depends on them. (Because, in a very real way, it does.) The goals you pick will focus your department or organization on where to spend the vast majority of energy, attention, and efforts next year.

This exercise recognizes that your organization is a mosaic of people — and that its success and sense of cohesion are intimately tied to the hearts, minds, and actions of the professionals that choose to come to work every day. Your people.

So you’ll want to set aside some undisturbed time to reflect on what’s most important to you and your employees in the year ahead, and periodically, to revisit those goals. Be thorough and clear, and pick a short list — no more than five key goals for the year ahead.

Below you’ll find some tips on how to design your goal shortlist for the new year. As you read through them, keep in mind that some of these can take the form of one-on-one interactions, and some will be more appropriate for executive team discussion once you’ve gotten your initial responses.

5 steps to better business goals for 2018

1) Bottom-up and top-down. No one employee — including no leader — has all the answers. So you should not only identify your business goals, but ask the people reporting to you to do the same — and then ask them to repeat the exercise with their reports, and so on, throughout the organization. This will be essential data for setting goals that are credible and achievable.

2) Clean out your blind spots. Every organization has them — and so does every leader. Here again, you can and should draw on your colleagues and reports for help. The questions below are designed to help you and your employees find the blind spots that can lead your organization or group astray — so you can clean them out and chart a clear course forward:

What have we tried to achieve in 2017 that we must accomplish in 2018, and how will that be rewarding to you and your team?

In thinking about our outcomes (results, quality, customer engagement, etc.), what targets are we hitting — and which ones are we missing due to our own actions as executives?

What am I not hearing or dealing with as a leader that I need to address?

Is there anything I can do to get out of the way of — and, indeed, accelerate — our success?

3) Lessons learned this year… to incorporate into next year. The turn of the year offers a perfect opportunity for a business to evaluate its performance, and adjust course. Consider these questions:

What new lessons has 2017 taught us — and what lessons from 2017 and prior years have we yet to fully address? Are there endemic issues that need to be looked at?

How has our business ecosystem — market, products, customers, providers, partners, costs, competition or regulatory landscape — changed since last year? How well did our strategy track in response — or in leading those changes? And what do we need to adjust in 2018?

How have our SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) evolved in 2017 — and what should that mean for our goals in the new year?

What are the most relevant metrics for today? What do success, neutral, or failure look like in 2018? What should our measurable goals be going forward?

4) Make them relevant to your bigger picture. Once you’ve settled on your goals for 2018, ask yourself: how aligned are these goals — and our people — with our organization’s business plan and three-year strategic priorities? With its larger mission and vision? This is a good opportunity to check your direction before plunging into the new year.

5) Communicate! Decide the best way to package your goals, and then communicate them throughout your organization. How will you cascade these messages, and ensure everyone is crystal clear on the goals you’ve worked so hard to design?

Usha Dubey was barely nine when one of the world's worst industrial disasters struck Bhopal.

She lost her elder brother in the leakage of the deadly methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas from the Union Carbide factory in the city. The gas killed thousands in the night of 2-3 December, 1984. Lakhs of people were left with devastating disabilities.

""I was also considered dead and was thrown among a pile of bodies, but a nurse found me alive and saved me,"" recalls Dubey.

""My memory of the gas disaster is that I was standing and crying, 'mere bhai ko le aao' (bring back my brother). As my parents had already died I had no one in the world and I was kept in a camp that housed children like me who were found abandoned after the disaster,"" says Dubey, who still suffers from after-effects of the gas.

""I have severe breathing issues and can't talk for long. Now that I am speaking to you, I won't be able to talk for hours. I always feel exhausted and can't see clearly. I got married but my husband left me because he felt I was mostly ill and not of much use,"" she says.

""The governments never cared about us. In hospitals for gas-affected, it is extremely difficult to get medicines. There are long queues and if at all one gets the medicines, they are not good,"" she says.

Even 33 years after the gas tragedy, the survivors find it hard to get proper medical care and face administrative apathy. The worst is the case of the woman survivors, particularly, those who were widowed in the tragedy.

Pension Stopped

There are around 20,000 such women, but the meagre pension of Rs 1,000 that was started in 2010, was stopped a couple of years ago. These women don't get a pension and despite several agitations, no action has been taken in this regard.

Activist Balkrishna Namdev says that it is unfortunate that the women who lost their husbands and who suffer from severe ailments have been deprived of the meagre amount.

In fact, there have been protests, and demands have been raised from different quarters that the government should start the pension so that the survivors could sustain themselves, but this has fallen on deaf ears.

Hospitals were set up for gas victims and were aimed at providing them free treatment but now most of them are now lacking in facilities. Even the super-specialty Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) is facing shortage of doctors and many of its departments are not functioning.

'Nobody Bothers About Us'

Take the case of Aqueel Ahmad, who has been on dialysis for almost 12 years. He says that every month he needs medicines worth Rs 3,000-4,000 from outside as hospitals that were set up for the gas victims don't provide medical care.

Rani, another gas victim, says that the promises never materialized. ""Neither governments provided medicines, not any efforts were made for employment generation,"" she says. Aneesa Bi, 65, rues that for the governments, the plight of gas victims seems to be a non-issue. ""Nobody bothers about us,"" she says.

The figure of deaths due to gas tragedy and its after-effects crossed 20,000 long ago. Lakhs were suffering from pulmonary issues, ailments of skin, throat, eyes and kidney.

NGOs working for the gas victims say that the agreement between Indian government and the Union Carbide in 1989 was totally unjust and there was little focus on proper compensation, rehabilitation and medical care of the victims.

The affect of the gas passed on to next generation too. The huge toxic waste lying in the premises of the Union Carbide factory led to severe contamination of underground water in the areas near the factory. Every year after rains, it continues to contaminate the water even more.

Cancer prevalence is too high among gas victims and kidney ailments are too common.

But, all these issues remain unresolved. Activist Abdul Jabbar says that the compensation case is in Supreme Court. ""The BJP is at the helm both in the state as well as centre. The government should take steps in this regard,"" he says.

""The survivors, especially, the women who were widowed in the gas tragedy, should be given lifetime pension of at least Rs 2,000 per month"", adds Jabbar, the convener of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan (BGPMUS).

In a letter to PM Narendra Modi, BGPMUS' ND Jayaprakash and Abdul Jabbar have drawn his attention towards the fact that the huge chemical waste still remains in factory premises and its removal wasn't considered a priority despite the Swachh Bharat campaign.

""The complaints of abdominal pain are too high among gas victims exposed to contaminated ground water.

That's when car dealerships are under pressure to make their numbers, say insiders.
If you're considering a new car purchase in 2018, wait until Labor Day, which consumer finance expert Andrea Woroch says is considered the ""Black Friday for car shopping.""","No single consumer purchase causes more headaches, more irritation and leads to more buyer's remorse than a car purchase. Nothing even comes close to it.

And with good reason: Car dealerships love fees and extras perhaps more than anyone else in the travel industry. They rarely tell the entire truth about their prices, indiscriminately blurring the lines between the sticker price, invoice price and out-the-door price. They try to upsell you on preposterous extras like ""undercarriage protection"" and extended warranties. And they play games with you when you just want to buy a car, doing the ""I'll-talk-to-the-boss"" two-step while you stew in a cubicle.

The result can be up to 15 percent net profit margins on some sales for the dealership. But it can leave you feeling ripped off.

I ought to know. I've played that game more times than I'd care to admit.

But there's good news for you: In just a few weeks, a brief window will open where you will have the advantage. And outside of those few weeks, I have a little advice that will ensure you don't get taken on your next car purchase.

When to buy

If you're in the market for a new car, the scales tip in your favor on the last day of the month. That's when car dealerships are under pressure to make their numbers, say insiders. ""If you can coincide your purchase with the end of a sales quarter -- March, June, September or December -- you’re liable to see even greater results,"" says Jim Milan, a manager for Auto Accessories Garage, a car accessories website.

The day of the week and time of day is important, too. Swing by your dealership on a Monday or Tuesday, when no one else is there, and you'll get better service and perhaps even a lower price. Later in the week? Not so much. Also, if you come into the dealership late in the day, you'll probably be able to negotiate a more favorable price, so it pays to wait until late afternoon to take that test drive.

Pay attention to specials, too. Manufacturer promotions can change monthly. For example, last March, GM offered lessees of Asian brands a $3,000 bonus on select models.

""You could lease a 2017 Cruze LT from just $99 for 24 months with $219 at signing,"" says Alex Bernstein, a senior pricing analyst at CarsDirect. ""We haven't seen a deal that good on the Cruze ever since.""

Generally, the best time of year to buy a new car is fall and winter, according to data compiled by TrueCar, an auto buying site. Bonus points if you can hit the retailer at the end of the model year. For example, the car I covet is a 2017 Honda CR-V. The model year ends in December. Maybe I'll pay a visit to my dealership on a late Monday afternoon at the end of December to see if anyone there is in a sellin' mood. Betcha they will be.

If you're considering a new car purchase in 2018, wait until Labor Day, which consumer finance expert Andrea Woroch says is considered the ""Black Friday for car shopping.""

""With the release of new models and the holidays coming up, dealerships need to make room for new vehicles and lower prices on older models accordingly,"" she says. ""You can also expect more competitive financing offers like zero-percent interest for qualified buyers. Such deals will trickle through the following months so keep looking out for discounts through October through December. Just don’t get talked into buying the latest model for more.""

How to buy

The ""how"" is an interesting -- but more complex -- question. You can drop by your dealership for a test drive, but that's exactly what they want you to do. Once you're behind the wheel of a new car, they think you'll be hooked and the sale will be theirs. Don't put yourself in that situation.

""From the color of the ink salespeople use, to the angle of the writing, to the need to 'check with the boss,' to the circling of numbers, it's all thought out and strategically planned to get someone to buy,"" says Bill Brierley, a former car salesman from San Diego. ""It was fascinating the psychology that they put into everything.""

So, rule #1: Avoid the dealership if possible. Do all of your negotiating before you buy, not when they have you right where they want you.

But where?

Hire a broker

Professional car buyers like AAA or Costco will find the model you want and broker the deal. They usually negotiate with a dealership's fleet department, which is programmed to sell lots of cars quickly. The broker adds a fee, but you usually pay close to or less than the published invoice price.

Readers have had mixed results with these services. Pam Mandel bought her car through Costco, which offered fixed pricing and ""no screwing around."" She adds, ""it was painless."" But another reader, David Simundson, tried AAA's Auto Buying Service. Not only did it fail to find the vehicle he wanted, but it inundated him with phone calls about cars he didn't want. ""Never again,"" he says.

My own experience with AAA was similarly disappointing. It found a price on the car I wanted for a few hundred dollars below the sticker price. No one pays the sticker price.

Use an online buying site

These come in many different flavors. Among the most most popular sites: CarsDirect and TrueCar, both of which let you find actual prices on cars and shop real-time inventory. There are also online sites such as Authority Auto, which will look for the model you want, but charge a fee. Or you could check sites like Carvana for a pre-owned vehicle.

Online buying can work, but not always. Audrey Strong used TrueCar to buy a used car earlier this year. ""Worked great,"" she says. ""The car actually existed, was on the lot and they gave it to us for less than the price listed, provided the Carfax [repair report] and were transparent about issues with the car.""

I personally found the inventory selection on TrueCar was good for my desired model, but it required that I enter my personal information, which added me to some dealerships' spam lists. For the vehicle I wanted, Carvana only listed used, high-mileage vehicles which were of limited appeal. CarsDirect had the most options. And Authority Auto's approach felt wrong. I'm deeply skeptical of paying money for the opportunity to buy something, so I skipped it.

Direct negotiations

My favorite buying method is being your own broker and buyer. Use a service like TrueCar or Kelley Blue Book to find the invoice price and ""fair market range"" of the vehicle you want. Then contact the dealerships directly by email. Pro tip: Dig up the fleet manager and contact that person directly, asking for a bid. They typically won't try to lure you in for a test drive, focusing instead on making a quick sale.

That's what Ross Werland did when he bought a Subaru last year. ""Using a very specific model, I queried every Subaru dealership within an hour's drive via email about that model,"" he recalls. ""All of them got back to me with offers. Very easy. We took the lowest one.""

If only it were always that easy. But these expert tips will help you get closer to a painless car purchase.",Buying A New Car? Read This First,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/buying-a-new-car-read-this-first_us_5a26e8e2e4b0f69ae8ce8082?section=us_business

Singh was raped and an iron rod was inserted into her vagina, that ruptured her intestine. Her friend was thrashed and the two were thrown out of the moving bus. She died of her injuries. The case resulted in an outpouring of anger and led to crucial changes in India's rape laws.

In economically-savvy Gujarat, dissatisfaction among traders and farmers about demonetisation and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) seems to have turned the tide in Congress's favour. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is nowhere close to losing its grip on a state it has ruled for nearly two decades, a new opinion poll showed.

The poll predicted a ""photo finish"" with a definite thrust in momentum for the Congress which has tied with the BJP for the same voting percentage after the third round of the pre-election tracker. It predicted that both parties would get 43% of the votes polled.

""The momentum is clearly in the Congress's favour,"" CSDS director Sanjay Kumar told The Telegraph, adding that ""normally, the party that comes from behind tends to gain.""

The third and final round of the pre-election tracker was conducted by Lokniti and Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) for ABP News from November 23-30, 2017, after interviewing 3,655 voters in 200 locations spread across 50 assembly constituencies.

Congress rallied in Gujarat riding mostly on the anger of traders — who form the backbone of state — over demonetisation and GST. While the overnight banning of higher currency notes stalled the rural economy across the country, GST brought Gujarati traders out on to the streets.

In October the BJP was ahead by four points among traders, a lead that has all but vanished, with the Congress claiming 43 percent votes, as opposed to BJP's 40 percent among the trading community.

Congress has not only gained from farmers' resentment but women voters too seemed to have shifted towards the party – from 39% favouring Congress in the last round to 42% in the final tracker poll.

Another interesting shift has been among the Patel community. Traditionally a strong BJP base, the Patels constitute about 15 per cent of the state's population. The Patel/Patidars were found to be backing the Congress in the latest poll. The Adivasis who had gravitated towards the BJP in the first two opinion polls seem to be back with the Congress.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's charisma endures, there has been a dip in his popularity – down to 64 percent from 67 percent at the end of October.

Suburban Express, an Illinois-based company that services University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) students, sent a promotional email to its customers several days ago, touting “passengers like you” among its perks. “You won’t feel like you’re in China when you’re on our buses,” the ad read. The bus company then issued a follow-up email titled “apology,” wherein it expressed its disappointment at the university’s admission of Chinese international students. (University data shows that there are about 5,900 students from China attending the school, making up approximately 12 percent of its student body.) The bus company claimed that “mismanagement” put the school in a “financial bind” and therefore pushed the university to accept large numbers of international students.

“Nearly 20% of U of I students are natives of China, and this high percentage of nonnative english speakers places a variety of burdens on domestic students,” the “apology” email read. “We agree that having a healthy mixture of different cultures and ethnicities is valuable. But we’re not comfortable with the idea of selling our university to the highest foreign bidder.” Suburban Express eventually attempted to walk back its statements on Tuesday, saying the promotion was “grotesquely xenophobic in nature” and the followup email attempted to “excuse a wrongfully nationalist statement.” But by then, the company was already under fire. The anti-Chinese ad was swiftly slammed across campus, with the school officials making it clear that such messaging would not be tolerated. “The message specifically insulted members of our Chinese, Asian and Asian American communities who are a vital and valued part of every aspect of both the University of Illinois and our local cities.” a statement from the Student Affairs office read. “We cannot prevent a private company from operating in our community. But we can, loudly and unambiguously, say that the opinions expressed by Suburban Express are offensive, bigoted, insulting and in direct opposition to the values of this university.”

Ald. Ameya Pawar, chairman of the city council’s Asian-American Caucus, called for the Aviation Committee to hold hearings regarding the incident, as the company frequently shuttles students to Chicago’s O’Hare airport, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. State Attorney General Lisa Madigan said Monday that she issued a subpoena to the company over potential civil rights violations. “I am concerned that this advertisement may reflect that Suburban Express is discriminating against potential customers,” Madigan said in a press release. “Under the law, access to transportation must not be impacted or based on a person’s race or national origin. My office is investigating to determine whether Suburban Express’ policies and practices violate the law.” University student group Asian Pacific American Coalition suggested alternative transportation options for those outraged by the incident. The organization also broke down why the Suburban Express emails were so inappropriate. Using the phrase “passengers like you,” its statement read, implies that white students are given an option to avoid students of color, which points to the “much larger problem of racism and white supremacy in this nation.” Labeling the company’s follow-up email as a “non-apology,” the group also mentioned how the presence of international students on campus shouldn’t be a source of outrage. “Having the ability to network with and learn from students from other countries is a privilege,” the group statement read. “To limit our social understanding to those in Illinois limits our students’ education.” As the community awaits the results of Madigan’s investigation, the company claims it will take steps to “reform” its practices. “Although we have never prevented any student of any demographic from boarding our bus simply because of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender orientation or nationality, the comments made have created the image that Chinese exchange students are not welcome, and we are striving to change this,” Suburban Express wrote in a Facebook post.

ISTANBUL – Emerging from a crowd of around a dozen women, Farida, a 32-year-old Syrian refugee living in Istanbul, stood in front of a cabinet full of bright and colorful threads and beads. Looking at the materials with friends, she mused what color she should use for her next earring project.

“Let’s not use orange and pink this time,” she murmured to one of her friends, another Syrian refugee.

After picking her favorite colors, she knuckled down at a workshop table at the center of Small Projects Istanbul, housed in a basement in the Fatih neighborhood bustling with dozens of other Syrian women and their children.

“I usually prefer to make the earrings in light colors. My all time favorites are white and blue. White symbolizes hope and peace. Blue is for clarity and pureness,” she said.

Farida’s color choices are a reflection of her past. A year and a half ago, the mother of three fled her home in Aleppo, where she was a housewife and her husband was an Arabic teacher.

For over a year, Farida has participated in the “Drop Earrings, Not Bombs” initiative where she has mastered the art of making brightly colored, drop-shaped earrings.

Didem Tali Syrian women stand in front of a selection of threads at a workshop with Drop Earrings, Not Bombs.

The drop-earrings the refugee women make are then sold both in stores and online. Aline Joubert, the media manager of Small Projects Istanbul, who is also involved with the project, said each participant makes 300 Turkish lira (around $85) a month with the earrings. The project’s revenue is evenly distributed among the participants. Although a family is unlikely to get by with the earring-making income alone, Joubert said it fills a gap.

“It’s not a lot of money, but it’s not trivial either,” Joubert said. “It’s usually enough for the monthly grocery expenses of a Syrian family here. This way, women can be independent and they don’t have to ask for money from anyone when they’re shopping for groceries. But more importantly, this is the first job many of these women here ever had. It gives them a confidence that they’re able to make a contribution to their households,” she said.

The contribution Farida makes goes a long way, particularly as her husband is currently struggling to find stable employment.

“I love it when one of my children asks for something at a supermarket and I am able to buy it for my child,” she said, with a proud smile.

Many Syrians who have fled their war-torn country for Turkey struggle to support their families. There are more than 2.9 Syrian refugees registered with UNHCR in Turkey, and more than 225,000 in Istanbul. Unable to find steady jobs, many look for work in the informal labor sector, where “exploitation includes child labor, long working hours, poor health and safety conditions, increased risk of occupational accidents and low wages,” according to a report from the International Migration Institute and the University of Oxford.

What’s more, for women like Farida, attending regular earring-making workshops has benefits that far exceed the modest financial gains.

Research shows that, when a refugee family relocates to a new country, women tend to be particularly vulnerable to social isolation and mental health problems due to language barriers and the constriction of gender roles, especially after fleeing war. However, like many of her peers, Farida has found friendship and a community with her fellow earring-makers.

“Istanbul is a great base for Syrians, but when we first came here we didn’t know anyone,” Farida said.

Didem Tali Earrings made by Syrian refugee women working with Drop Earrings, Not Bombs, an income-generation and community building project.

For many survivors of war and trauma, art and color therapy are proven ways to process past traumas and help with symptoms of illnesses such as depression and PTSD, which many refugee women suffer from.

Farida doesn’t have a home to go back to in Aleppo, and making earrings has allowed her to stop dwelling on her difficult past.

“I’ve never made handcrafts before, and I really like artistically challenging myself. Even if the workshop is over, I will continue trying new things. It’s also a good feeling to think that the earrings I make will be worn by someone in different countries,” Farida said.","Syrian Women Have A Message: Drop Earrings, Not Bombs",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/05/17/syrian-women-have-a-message-drop-earrings-not-bombs_n_16671156.html?ir=WorldPost

The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles, called the story an “egregious, hurtful, and disgusting campaign of defamations,” according to court documents obtained by Variety. Sheen, 52, is seeking unspecified damages.

The Enquirer claimed in its report that Sheen, then about 19, sexually assaulted 13-year-old Haim on the set of the 1986 film “Lucas.” The tabloid quotes Haim’s friend Dominick Brascia as saying Haim and Sheen “smoked pot and had … anal sex.”

Sheen “categorically denies these allegations,” a rep for the actor said shortly after the story’s publication. Brascia is named as one of the suit’s defendants, as is Dylan Howard, chief content officer of American Media Inc., the Enquirer’s parent company.

Howard, the suit alleges, “is on an active vendetta against” Sheen.

“With calculated malice, the National Enquirer has concluded that it can make money by running false and salacious stories claiming that Mr. Sheen is a sexual molester that preys on young pubescent boys,” the suit claims.

Howard also has been the target of sexual misconduct allegations.

American Media told Variety in a statement that it was “look[ing] forward to litigating” against Sheen.

He went to the U.K. for a year and put together a curriculum on transgender surgery, training under the guidance of experienced surgeons.
And most health care professionals, Garcia thinks, would benefit greatly from basic training about transgender patients.
“There isn’t a natural incentive to train people who will then compete with you.”The Growth Of Transgender Surgery Centers In The U.S.Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is part of a growing trend.
And one advantage big academic medical centers have over smaller private clinics is the bureaucratic power they bring to bear on issues like health coverage.","When Dr. Maurice Garcia was a young surgical intern in San Francisco in the early 2000s, he regularly encountered transgender patients who had horror stories about their encounters with doctors.

Once, a transgender woman came to him distressed that she couldn’t find a surgeon to remove her testicles. Garcia couldn’t fathom why she was having such a difficult time finding someone to perform a simple and common surgery routinely done for people with testicular cancer. He thought it was especially odd because there were significant medical benefits to the procedure; removing the testicles meant the woman could stop taking certain hormones and lower her dosage of other hormones.

“[She was] told, ‘I’m not a transgender surgeon, you have to find someone else,’” Garcia recalled. “Or, ‘I don’t believe in that.’”

These kinds of roadblocks moved some patients to seek gender-affirming surgery in Mexico, Thailand or elsewhere, where procedures were cheaper but surgical standards might be lower. When they returned to San Francisco with serious complications from botched procedures, neither Garcia nor his colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, knew how to manage the injuries.

A Knowledge Gap In Transgender Care

Currently, medical schools devote only an average of five hours of their curriculum to teaching “LGBT-related content,” according to a 2009-2010 survey of deans representing 150 medical schools in North America. This is woefully inadequate to prepare doctors to see and treat the approximately 1.4 million American adults who identify as transgender, and may explain why members of the medical community appear to have such a strained and fraught relationship with their transgender patients.

Garcia wanted to make things better for his patients. So he sought permission from his superiors to learn more about transgender care and bring the knowledge back to UCSF. He went to the U.K. for a year and put together a curriculum on transgender surgery, training under the guidance of experienced surgeons. When he returned, he established UCSF’s first gender-affirming surgery program.

Now, three years later, he’s brought his expertise to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he established the hospital’s Transgender Surgery and Health Program — the second such academic medical center to offer gender-affirming surgery on the West Coast, as The New York Times first reported.

Garcia believes that academic programs like these are key to helping not just transgender patients in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but patients all over the world. Unlike doctors at private clinics, where it’s thought that the majority of gender confirmation surgeries are conducted, those at academic centers also gather research to be published in peer-reviewed journals that will help deepen the field of genital surgery — perhaps discovering techniques that could help a wounded veteran or cancer survivor retain some measure of fertility, sexual or urinary function.

And most health care professionals, Garcia thinks, would benefit greatly from basic training about transgender patients. He hopes that the research he conducts at his center, as well as the expertise he builds as he develops a model for transgender care, will also help change the dialogue among medical professionals about how to compassionately and competently treat transgender patients.

Performing more gender confirmation surgeries at academic centers is also important because it fills an important gap in medical education, said Dr. Loren Schechter, director of the Center for Gender Confirmation surgery at Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago.

“One of the things that’s lacking in medical schools is gender education,” he said. “When academic medical centers are performing the surgeries, you’ve got exposure to medical students ― the next generation of doctors.”

Garcia also plans to take the center’s goals a step further by establishing a fellowship program for urology surgeons who want to gain specialty training in transgender surgery. This fellowship, set to launch next summer, is part of a growing movement. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago were the first to offer year-long fellowships in transgender surgery in August, and Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia just announced the launch of its new fellowship program for surgeons in November.

Garcia hopes that the spread of fellowship programs in the U.S. means that doctors interested in the field can train at home, as opposed to traveling abroad like he had to when he couldn’t find other experts to mentor him.

“Private practice is a very lucrative business,” he said. “There isn’t a natural incentive to train people who will then compete with you.”

The Growth Of Transgender Surgery Centers In The U.S.

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is part of a growing trend. By adding a transgender surgical program, the hospital now joins other academic medical centers, like UCSF, the Cleveland Clinic, Boston Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.

And one advantage big academic medical centers have over smaller private clinics is the bureaucratic power they bring to bear on issues like health coverage. In addition to bringing gender confirmation surgery to Southern California, Cedars-Sinai’s program also accepts patients who are on Medi-Cal and Medicare, opening up access to crucial treatment that was generally available only from expensive private practice clinics. The hospital’s experience dealing with health insurance companies can also spare patients a lot of heartache and money.

Nikolai Miles, a 26-year-old security guard in Thousand Oaks, California, decided to get a double mastectomy back in 2014 — a standard part of the series of surgeries that transgender men can get to affirm their identity. He went to a private practice in San Francisco that required him to pay all the money ― $8,500 ― upfront, while assuring him that they were going to work with his insurance to get as much of the operation covered as possible.",This Doctor Wants To Transform Transgender Care In America,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/12/06/maurice-garcia-transgender-care_n_18766632.html?ir=Healthy+Living

One such firm is Amazon that touts its environmental credentials. These include hosting rooftop solar systems, supporting Clean Power Plan, and committing to 100 percent renewable energy for its web farms. But, when soliciting HQ2 proposals, it has not listed climate considerations.

Not surprisingly, city rankings produced by various analysts fail to account for climate change vulnerability — an issue that will affect the viability of any business. Including climate vulnerability data from FEMA, we identify two cities that feature in the top 10 in both rankings. We hope this piece will motivate any company scouting for a new location to look into the climate vulnerability dimensions.

What is Amazon looking for?

In September 2017, Amazon announced that it is going to create its second headquarters (HQ2) and invited cities to send their proposals. In its Request for Proposals (RFP), Amazon listed core elements of its preferred location: “Metropolitan areas with more than one million people; a stable and business-friendly environment; urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent; communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.”

By the October 18 deadline, 238 proposals were in: from cities in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, as well as by counties and even states! An economic development group supporting the bid of Greater Tucson sought to send a unique gift: a 21-foot saguaro cactus. But Amazon declined to accept such gifts as part of the bidding process, although it welcomed other gifts such as tax breaks.

Business Analysts Make Recommendations

Amazon will announce its decision only next year. But this has not prevented several analyst firms and media outlets to rank these proposals and make their recommendations. Moody’s Analytics led the charge and published their top 65 candidates. Their analysis examines 34 variables such as the business environment, costs, human capital, quality of life, transportation, and distance to Amazon’s core facilities, including Amazon’s owner Jeff Bezos’ home.

Others soon followed. Anderson Economic Group produced its list of 35 top candidates, examining three categories of variables such as access to labor and services, ease of transportation, and cost of doing business. CNN, without revealing its methodology, also identified eight cities that Amazon should consider. The New York Times presented its own analysis, identifying Denver as the only candidate that can offer everything Amazon needs.

But where is climate change in these rankings?

It is surprising that neither Amazon nor the analysts, who have ranked various cities, thought it fit to consider how a given city might be vulnerable to climate change. After all, sea level rise, extreme temperatures, drought, and floods would probably make it difficult for the projected 50,000 Amazon workers to function effectively in HQ2. In fact, Moody’s recently told its clients it incorporates climate risk in its state and municipal bond ratings.

There is substantial evidence that climate change is already impacting communities in the U.S. According to NOAA, in 2017 alone, there were 15 significant weather and climate related events, such as drought, flooding, freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones, and wildfires, each costing over $1 billion. Many of these events occurred in relative proximity to the top ranked cities for Amazon HQ2. The map below depicts these billion-dollar extreme weather events and the proximate location of these cities.

Suppose we include climate change in the rankings

We have constructed a simple indicator to measure cities’ vulnerability to climate- and weather-related extreme events. Using FEMA data on declared emergencies such as severe storms, severe ice storms, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, coastal storms, and weather-related fires, we counted days (starting 1992) during which a county had a federally declared emergency or disaster. We started the analysis for year 1992 to include Hurricane Andrew, the second most damaging storm in the U.S. after the 1926 Great Miami storm.

Table 1 presents the top 25 cities as per Moody’s ranking and according to our climate vulnerability ranking. Top ten cities for each group are highlighted. Only two cities make it to the Top 10 in both: Pittsburgh and Portland. This suggests that economic and business criteria probably do not help us to understand a city’s vulnerability to climate change.

Dolsak and Prakash

It is not clear how much importance Amazon should attach to climate vulnerability rankings. That is, how much should it weigh climate vulnerability in relation to economic indicators? Further, because cities may already have taken some proactive measures to climate-proof by say building sea walls, should cities be ranked on their resilience to climate change, as opposed to vulnerability? These are fair questions that Amazon and other businesses looking for a new location for their offices or factories should consider. As never before, there is a compelling reason for firms to include climate change issues in their business plans.

The most ardent support for the Trump administration’s plan to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem comes from an odd coupling of American Jews and Christian Evangelicals.

American Jews, as usual, do not speak with a single voice on Trump’s move. As reported in the New York Times, they responded with both “praise and alarm.” But those who support it are easy to understand in conventional nationalistic and political terms.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the leading voice of the conservative wing of American Judaism, referred to Jerusalem as “Israel’s undivided capital city,” and argued that moving the U.S. Embassy would not “in any way prejudge the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.”

Right or (more probably) wrong, there’s nothing mysterious about this position. It’s garden variety tribal politics.

The response of evangelical Christians, on the other hand, requires a bit more explanation. According to the Christian Broadcasting Network, which claims to provide “the Christian perspective” on public affairs, American Evangelicals “are ‘ecstatic’ over the Trump administration’s plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.”

“Ecstatic” is a particularly apt word here, although “enraptured” would have worked, too. The specific religious ecstasy at play here derives from a Protestant theology created in 19th Century England, known as “dispensationalism.”

Dozens of articles and scholarly works have been written about dispensationalism, but the end point is clear: the seventh and final stage of God’s dealing with man, called the Millennium or End of Days, will usher in an earthly paradise.

But there’s a catch. The earthly paradise will come only after the Jews rebuild the Temple in Israel’s capital, Jerusalem. A series of cataclysmic events will then follow, culminating in a final war of civilizations. In the end, Jesus will return to rule in glory.

Christians will bask in a thousand-year reign of peace in God’s kingdom.

Jews will be slaughtered by the millions.

Just because millions of Jews will be collateral damage on the road to their earthly paradise, of course, doesn’t mean that Evangelicals don’t love them.

Evangelicals demonstrate their sensitivity to the thorny problem of exterminating Jews by engaging in a polite theological debate over what they call the “Future Jewish Holocaust Problem.” One biblical scholar asserts that “Jews will soon be slaughtered in a bloodbath that exceeds that of Hitler’s Holocaust.” Another is more politically correct, arguing that “while this certainly seems to be the case,” perhaps “we should not try to quantify” the extent of the carnage. According to yet another evangelical deep thinker, maybe the Jews will get off easy, and only “two-thirds of the Jewish people [living in Israel] will be exterminated.”

For evangelical Christians, fulfillment of this prophecy is a good thing.

For Jews, not so much. For them, an earthly paradise would probably offer better options than another Holocaust and the extinction of their religion.

Dispensationalism is not a fringe theology among the approximately 50 million American Evangelicals. It was first popularized in the United States in 1970 by a best-selling book called “The Late, Great Planet Earth.” The 11-book “Left Behind” series, beginning in 1995, then catapulted the doctrine into the “mainstream” of evangelical thinking. Together, the works sold about 100 million books.

Since then, dispensationalist theology has been taught to tens of millions through Bible camps, colleges, theological seminaries, films, revival meetings, Sunday schools, churches, and talk radio. Evangelicals control hundreds of radio stations. They sit on, and sometimes dominate, schoolboards and legislatures across the nation.

They are an enormous political force.

And Donald Trump owes them. Big time. They put him in office.

Now he is paying them back. Anyone who doubts that Trump takes presidential action in order to cater to his evangelical base need only look at his own words. Trump met in September with evangelical leaders to reassure them that he was pursuing their agenda. He sought and received assurance that “the Christians know all the things I’m doing for them, right?”

As a payback to Evangelicals, Trump’s Embassy move makes a certain kind of lunatic sense. Evangelicals believe it takes them one step closer to the supposed biblical promise of an earthly paradise free of Jews. And some Jews also support the Embassy move on their own biblical grounds, having mostly to do with history, and without the “convert or die” part.

All of these improbable strands came together at a signing ceremony staged to look like a Saturday Night Live skit.

There was Donald Trump - liar, serial adulterer, admitted sexual predator, profane braggart, racist - solemnly affixing his ridiculous kindergarten signature to a presidential order arising out of a 19th Century prophecy.

There was Mike Pence - self-righteous fundamentalist Christian who worries that being alone in a room with a woman other than his wife could lead him on a path straight to Hell - gazing adoringly at Trump, who really shouldn’t be left alone with a woman other than his wife, and who doesn’t exhibit any of the Christian values that Pence claims to hold dear.

Making an announcement that incites violence in the Middle East, isolates America from allies and foes alike, sets back hope for a successful peace process, and brings absolutely no benefit to the United States.

All because of his supposed love of the Jewish people and his undying support for the Jewish nation of Israel.

As payback to people who believe that any Jews left after most of them have been exterminated in another Holocaust will abandon their religion and accept Jesus as their savior.

Dear President Trump,

My name is Riju Agrawal. My family immigrated to the U.S. from India 25 years ago. My parents represent the thousands of Indian immigrants who come to this country as skilled workers and eventually become U.S. citizens through the long and arduous process of naturalization. However, I write to you today not as an immigrant, but as an American. In October, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it would make it more difficult for H-1B visa holders to renew their visas, in line with your ""Buy American, Hire American"" executive order. I implore you to reconsider these changes to the H-1B visa program. They will hurt, rather than help, our country and our economy.

However, I write to you today not as an immigrant, but as an American.

You issued the executive order in April in response to ongoing concerns about the loss of American jobs to low-wage immigrant labor. Your administration argued that on average, H-1B workers are paid less than the median wages for the roles into which they are hired because the program has been exploited by firms like Infosys, Cognizant, and Tata Consultancy Services to outsource American jobs to cheaper Indian labor.

Your executive order suggests that you aim to protect the ""economic interests"" of American workers. But we can't protect the long-term economic interests of American workers by hobbling the fast-growing technology firms that are going to create high-skilled American jobs in the future.

Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook represent the best of American innovation and ingenuity, and they're changing almost every dimension of our lives. These firms rely on foreign-born workers because of talent gaps in roles ranging from software engineering to management. By hiring foreign-born workers, the firms are able to grow more rapidly, which in turn helps create additional jobs for American workers. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg wondered publicly, ""Why do we offer so few H-1B visas for talented specialists that the supply runs out within days of becoming available each year, even though we know each of these jobs will create two or three more American jobs in return?""

We can't protect the long-term economic interests of American workers by hobbling the fast-growing technology firms that are going to create high-skilled American jobs in the future.

Furthermore, restrictions to the H-1B visa program will render American companies less competitive than their foreign counterparts in China by increasing the cost of labor and hindering the transfer of ideas and knowledge. Making it difficult for American companies to find the highest-skilled and lowest-cost workers will only increase the cost of products that we all need and want. American workers are also American consumers!

Microsoft previously explained in a court motion that ""Washington's technology industry relies heavily on the H-1B visa program...Microsoft, which is headquartered in Washington, employs nearly 5,000 people through the program. Other Washington companies, including Amazon, Expedia, and Starbucks, employ thousands of H-1B visa holders. Loss of highly skilled workers puts Washington companies at a competitive disadvantage with global competitors."" If we prevent these companies from inviting a few thousand workers to the U.S., they will have no choice but to either move their factories to China because the domestic costs of labor are too high, or to increase the prices of their products. Neither move would benefit American workers or American consumers.

American workers are also American consumers!

In recent remarks, both you and Secretary of State Tillerson emphasized the importance of a renewed partnership between the U.S. and India, especially at a time when China is behaving ""less responsibly"" in the Indo-Pacific region.

However, having lived in India and worked in Indian government, I can assure you that India will not continue a partnership that it views as one-sided. Your administration's desire to amend the H-1B program and limit the ability of talented Indians to work and live in the United States will surely strain ties between the two countries. Your team has already heard multiple complaints on the H-1B issue from India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, and Minister of Commerce & Industry Suresh Prabhu. Damaging the U.S.'s partnership with India because of the H-1B issue is a short-sighted move that will come back to haunt us later as China's rise in Asia continues unchecked.

India will not continue a partnership that it views as one-sided.

President Trump, I know you understand the importance of the H-1B visa for the American economy. You've said yourself, ""We need highly skilled people in this country...For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country."" For this reason, I implore you to restore the fast-track review (""premium processing"") of H-1B visa extension applications and to resist the urge to gut the H-1B program. Our American economy depends on it.

Your fellow American,

Riju Agrawal

“Net neutrality is something that is essential for small businesses, for consumers, and it is essential to keep the freedom associated with the internet alive.”He added that he’ll look into ways to defend net neutrality for the internet as a whole.

He added that he’ll look into ways to defend net neutrality for the internet as a whole.

Speaking at the Global Conference on Cyberspace held in New Delhi on Thursday, India’s minister of law and justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said that “right of access” to the internet should be “non-negotiable.”

“Internet is supposed to be democratic. It is a big global platform, but must be linked the local ideas and concepts,” Prasad said, according to The Indian Express.

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also attended the event, similarly expressed his support for net neutrality, saying that the protection “lowers the barriers of entry by preserving the internet as a fair and level playing field and helps businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive online.”

“Open internet facilitates the marginalized and oppressed segments that are not adequately represented in the mainstream media, to tell their stories and to mobilize justice, as we have seen in recent times,” he added.
