Editor's note: The following column first appeared on The Resurgent.

For the last several years, Democrats have been complaining about the constitution. While they lament Donald Trump's supposed disregard for the constitutional processes in the United States, they have been trying to delegitimize the fifty states as semi-sovereign powers in our federal system.

Democrats do not like that states are not just administrative subdivisions of Washington and they hate that the Senate has legitimacy.

In fact, Joy Reid of MSNBC is on social media calling rural Americans a ""core threat"" to our democracy. Note the following tweets below:

Both Kyle Griffin's original tweet and Reid's response highlight a core threat to our constitutional system: basic ignorance.

A direct conflict between the U.S. and Russia is a daily threat.

Two months ago, the Pentagon accused Russia of dropping bombs dangerously close to American special operations forces in eastern Syria. The U.S. issued a stern warning. In response, Russia threatened to retaliate if its troops came under fire by the U.S.

The two nations use a “de-confliction” hotline every day to share information about their operations in Syria, as military officers seek to avoid a mistake or miscalculation that could ignite a full-scale war between them.

Such a conflict is something neither side may want, but its two leaders may be powerless to prevent it. Why? Because of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s continuing investigation.

The longer the special counsel’s case drags on, the less likely it will be that President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin can sit down together in earnest to discuss key issues. These issues include diffusing the increasingly dangerous encounters in Syria, plus a myriad of other contentious topics that imperil American-Russian relations.

Gorbachev Issues Warning

Among those who are deeply concerned is Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. He recently described U.S.-Russia relations as having deteriorated into a “severe crisis,” warning that the nuclear arms control treaty that ended the Cold War is teetering on the precipice of collapse. Each side accuses the other of violating the terms of the treaty.

Writing in a Russian government newspaper, the former Soviet leader offered a dire prediction: “If the system of curbing nuclear arms crumbles, and that is exactly what the collapse of the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) treaty can lead to, the consequences will be catastrophic.”","Gregg Jarrett: Mueller's Investigation Imperils American-Russian Relations, Jeopardizing Lives",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/30/gregg-jarrett-muellers-investigation-imperils-american-russian-relations-jeopardizing#commenting

Earnhardt was appreciative of the award and said he's always done his best to represent the sport his family has been such a huge part of for decades.

""I always tell people all the time, all I wanted to do was be able to pay my bills and be able to race a long time,"" Earnhardt said. ""I've always tried to take a lot of pride in taking the sport to new places and introducing it to new people.""

He then tried to turn the attention to Truex, his good friend and former driver. Truex won two second-tier series titles driving for Earnhardt before Truex graduated to the Cup Series.

Now a married man expecting his first child next year, he said he finally understands what his father meant: there's only one chance to celebrate firsts, and he vowed to party hard Thursday night in celebration of Truex's first Cup title.

Earnhardt was winless in his final season, didn't make the playoffs, and wasn't all that competitive at the end of his 19-year career. But he's beloved by ""Earnhardt Nation"" and his fans supported him all year during his ""Apreci88tion"" tour.

His farewell party began earlier this week in a salute from sponsor Nationwide, which Earnhardt turned into a charity event.

Network news chief Andy Lack said in a memo to the staff that NBC received a complaint from an NBC employee about Lauer’s behavior on Monday and determined he violated company standards. NBC said the misconduct started when Lauer and a network employee were at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and continued beyond that assignment.

Lauer issued a statement Thursday following his termination.

Simply put, the FBI appears to be fully complicit in a cover-up that attempted to influence a presidential election for a favored candidate – Hillary Clinton.
And the truth was trampled on a Phoenix tarmac.","In Washington, the ostensible story is rarely the real story. We know, for example, that former President Clinton engineered a meeting with President Obama’s attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on the tarmac of the Phoenix Airport on June 27, 2016.

That’s the official story, replete with the charming and intentionally disarming detail that all they talked about was their grandchildren. It was just coincidental, don’t you know, that at the time the FBI was looking into Hillary Clinton’s use of a “personal” email server to send, receive and store classified information.

And it was also simply coincidental that just a few days later, the director of the FBI – who served under Attorney General Lynch – announced that he wouldn’t recommend a prosecution of Hillary Clinton.

Richard Nixon must be rolling over in his grave.

What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting.

What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting. In fact, the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous meeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton – but rather on one of the whistleblowers who got the word out.

The organization I head, Judicial Watch, asked the FBI on July 7, 2016, for any records that might pertain to the infamous tarmac meeting. We had to sue after we were ignored by the agency.

Then the FBI told us flat-out that it couldn’t find any records. And we now know that was flat-out untrue. Because, in responding to another one of our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, the Justice Department gave us heavily redacted documents that showed there were additional documents tucked away at the FBI headquarters.

If not for Judicial Watch's lawsuits these documents would still be hidden today.

Because of the revelation in our other lawsuit, the FBI – without our knowledge—""reopened"" our FOIA request. The agency supposedly found about 30 pages of information, which it needed six weeks to review. The FBI finally gave them to us late Thursday.

Now we know why the FBI played shell games. The documents show that FBI officials were concerned solely about the leaking of details of the tarmac meeting. None of the documents show top agency officials cared one whit about the propriety of the meeting itself, but only about who blew the whistle on the covert tête-à-tête.

In one email, an FBI official writes “we need to find that guy.” And in another we learn that the Phoenix FBI office was contacted “in an attempt to stem any further damage.” An FBI official working on Lynch’s security detail even goes so far as to suggest non-disclosure agreements to keep the full facts from coming forth.

The holiday season is here and with it comes a lot of cheerfully chaotic family get-togethers. As much as you’re looking forward to bounties of presents and festivities, you should also be ready to handle big crowds and prepare for the unexpected this year. Here are a couple of things to do now and pointers to ensure a stress-free holiday season.

Don’t be a perfectionist. Everyone has an ideal picture in their head for how holiday gatherings are going to go, but don’t be tied down by it. That’s an easy recipe for immediate disappointment and stress. Instead, keep an open mind, embrace any flaws or mishaps that might happen along the way and make the most of it. Cherish the small things and be grateful that you’re surrounded by loved ones.

Clean up the common areas. Organize, declutter and make way for your guests by clearing space in your entryway, living room and lounge areas. Add more coat hooks or shoe racks as needed and stock up on floor cushions or foldable chairs for extra seating. Consider purchasing removable chair covers to protect hard-to-clean furniture from inevitable spills.

Prep as much as possible ahead of time. It’s never too early to get a head start on the homemade dishes you’ll be serving. Buy non-perishable ingredients now and choose dishes that can be at least partially prepped (such as chopping vegetables or marinating meat) if not completely cooked ahead of time and reheated later.

If you have a dedicated dining area for the occasion, go ahead and set the table now. Employ minimalist style techniques to keep decorations sweet and simple this year. Consider placing a few candles and flowers in the middle instead of an ornate centerpiece.

Create different social zones. Having only one room for your guests to hang out in can get stuffy fast. Combat this problem by establishing multiple common areas for guests to mingle around in. Arrange a few chairs and blankets by a fire outdoors and move a drinks or an appetizer cart outside of the kitchen.

Plan an activity for down time. Capitalize on downtime before and after meals to foster togetherness with fun holiday activities. Station s’mores by the firepit and place board games around the house for easy access. For Thanksgiving, you can display a gratitude jar or tree station for guests to share what they’re most thankful for this year. For Hanukkah, set up tables to play the dreidel game, make candles or craft a menorah. During Christmas, organize a DIY ornament- or gingerbread house-making station.

Take mindful breaks for yourself. Focus on your personal well-being and pause from festivities when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Create a serene retreat for yourself, which can be as simple as soft throws piled on your bed, a bathtub filled with epsom salts or a walk outdoors.

Be prepared for overnight guests. As important as it is for you to have a private space of your own, create one of the same for your overnight guests. Stock the area with all necessary bathroom supplies, bedding and a list of important home information (phone numbers, door codes, WiFi passwords, etc). Spend a night there yourself to test it out and ensure your space is well-equipped and comfortable.",How to prep for family gatherings this holiday season,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/22/how-to-prep-for-family-gatherings-this-holiday-season.html
21,"['cultural', 'pizza', 'treasure', 'nations', 'unesco', 'list', 'united', 'money', 'neopolitan', 'world', 'youre', 'heritage', 'national']","You might think you’re reading The Onion, but here’s breaking news that’s not fake: Italy has petitioned a United Nations agency to give Neapolitan pizza World Cultural Heritage status.
The UNESCO process of granting World Cultural Heritage status is so blatantly commercial that a Japanese businessman got a faded silver mine that was closed in 1923 to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, even though there was nothing to look at.

Come on – with all the starving children in the world, you’re really spending piles of money to determine whether Neapolitan pizza is a World Cultural Heritage?
Now you know why conservatives want us to stop funding the United Nations.","You might think you’re reading The Onion, but here’s breaking news that’s not fake: Italy has petitioned a United Nations agency to give Neapolitan pizza World Cultural Heritage status.

More than 2 million Italians, who clearly have far too much time on their hands – or too much pizza in their hands – have signed a petition requesting this special status for a special food.

The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will vote Monday in Seoul, South Korea, on this critically important international issue – assuming war doesn’t break out on the Korean Peninsula first.

If it sounds crazy to put pizza on the Intangible Cultural Heritage list, consider the fact that the geniuses at UNESCO have already given six other kinds of food items such revered status.

The lucky winners on the list are the Mediterranean diet, Turkish coffee, Croatian gingerbread making, French gastronomy, Mexican cuisine, and washoku (a collective term for traditional Japanese food).

Hey, what else do the U.N. bureaucrats have to do? There aren’t any more pressing world issues to deal with, are there? Or am I forgetting something?

Now you might expect me to fulminate against the silliness and wastefulness of grown men and women, no doubt making comfortable salaries, spending money given to the United Nations to debate the importance of pizza. But I won’t. Quite to the contrary, I’m thrilled.

After all, UNESCO is supposed to be about preserving the world’s true cultural heritage. But instead, the U.N. agency makes a political hash, to use a gastronomic metaphor, of everything it touches.

For example, UNESCO recently made Hebron a Palestinian cultural site. But Hebron’s Tomb of the Patriarchs – where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, and Leah are said to be buried – is revered by Jews and Christians worldwide.

In other words, UNESCO allows itself to be just one more U.N. mechanism for bashing Israel.

The UNESCO process of granting World Cultural Heritage status is so blatantly commercial that a Japanese businessman got a faded silver mine that was closed in 1923 to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, even though there was nothing to look at.

But that meant that a million tourists a year came to see what was left of the meaningless silver mine, which formerly had only attracted around 15,000 people.

Moreover, by declaring places World Cultural Heritage sites, UNESCO actually puts those sites at risk, due to increasing numbers of tourists, combined with lack of funds to care for the sites.

It’s almost like the Vietnam War argument of “We had to destroy the village in order to save it.”

So if UNESCO wants to mess around with menus, I’m all for it. The high-level diplomats dealing with this major world issue will spend real money for food, transport, and first-class lodging for the vote in Seoul – which could just as well have been taken via Skype or even email. But that wouldn’t have been as much fun, of course.

Who could pass up a chance for some delicious kimchi on the world’s taxpayers’ dime? Obviously not the “flying wedge of…gourmets,” as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page scolded UNESCO way back in the mid-1980s.

So if UNESCO wants to play with food, I’m all for it. Doing so will keep the agency from causing more mischief on the international stage.

Here are four more foods UNESCO should spend the next two years debating for its Intangible Cultural Heritage list, thus distracting the diplomats from inserting themselves into geopolitical issues outside of their brief.

1. The Subway Foot-long Meatball Sandwich

There is much to debate here. Should the length be 12 inches? Longer or shorter? White, wheat, rye or some other kind of bread? What kind of tomato sauce? These and other serious issues could easily take up hundreds of hours of debate.

2. Fenway Franks

Must be boiled in a metal urn. But what size, exactly? And what type of metal? Must be carried on the back of a teenager for several innings of baseball – but how many innings? And how should the hot dogs be served? Soft? Firm? Lukewarm? Piping hot? Soggy? With mustard? In what kind of bun?

And these are only some of the possibilities for world diplomats to consider. This should be good for at least six months of debate.

3. Haggis

This is a delicious (if you’re a Scot) pudding made of sheep's heart, liver and lungs, served in a pouch made from the animal’s stomach. The possibilities for debate on this are endless.

What are the precise qualities and measurements required for each ingredient? I doubt the UNESCO folks will embrace this dish, but they sure will love playing golf on the famed the Old Course in St. Andrew’s between ballots.

4. Crow

If they had the slightest bit of decency, the UNESCO folks would serve themselves a plate of crow with a side of humble pie. Come on – with all the starving children in the world, you’re really spending piles of money to determine whether Neapolitan pizza is a World Cultural Heritage?

Eladio Rodriguez, an accountant at the Argentinian sports marketing company Torneos and Competencias, appeared in a New York City courtroom in the corruption trial of the former soccer officials.

Facing charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud are Juan Angel Napout, Jose Maria Marin and Manuel Burga, ex-heads of the soccer federations of Paraguay, Brazil and Peru, respectively.

Authorities say the sports marketing company, along with two other companies, made payments to FIFA officials to obtain broadcasting rights to tournaments and matches.

Rodriguez said Wednesday that Marin and Marco Polo del Nero, the current head of the Brazilian Football Confederation, were bribed with $1.5 million for the rights to the Copa America, a South American soccer tournament.

He said bribes were necessary to “to maintain a good relationship with CONMEBOL (South America’s soccer governing body) and to obtain the signing of contracts,” and that his job involved keeping track of the payments.

He claimed payments to the former soccer head of Brazil were made after the sports marketing company deposited money into offshore accounts of exchange remittance businesses. The payments would then be taken by the company to Buenos Aires and a chauffeur for the former FIFA vice president would collect the cash.

Grondona received at least $3 million in 2013, Rodriguez told the court. Payments to him were hidden in the company’s accounts under the name “Pope.”

After U.S. authorities began detaining top soccer officials in 2015, Rodriguez said he issued orders to destroy servers in Uruguay that contained bribe information. The company he worked for also shredded documents in Argentina, he said.

Rodriguez has made a deal with U.S. prosecutors and has forfeited more than $600,000.

There are sexual harassers, and then there is John Conyers, the Democrat from Detroit who made his congressional office an adjunct of his libido.

The evidence suggests Conyers believed that as a 27-term congressman he was entitled to the Washingon, DC, equivalent of the Ottoman Imperial Harem.

He routinely hit on his female staffers and his office was a den of sexual intrigue — allegedly featuring a jealous wife and a vindictive mistress — that properly belongs in a Bravo reality show if the network ever extends its “Real Housewives” franchise to Capitol Hill.

A political party is rarely provided an easier test case for its bona fides. Conyers is an 88-year-old man who finds it increasingly difficult to carry out his duties. He holds an exceedingly safe seat that, should he resign, will be taken over by another reliably progressive Democrat. In this case, the political cost to the party of showing that it’s serious about “zero tolerance” for sexual harassment is almost nil.

Yet House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, when asked about Conyers on “Meet the Press,” mumbled and looked at her shoes. She wasn’t able to summon any dudgeon, let alone high dudgeon, about Conyers. The harshest thing she said is that, “as John reviews his case — which he knows, which I don’t — I believe he will do the right thing.”

Technology and interior design are both crucial aspects of any media room. If your home doesn’t have a dedicated space solely for TV binges and movie nights, you’re not alone. Many households integrate the TV into a larger living room. It’s important that you design this space to ensure a fully functional and comfortable experience as you tune into nightly news and everyday entertainment. Here’s a rundown of some of the key features to consider.

Integrate surround sound technology. In order to take your media space to the next level and replicate a movie theater experience, you must first focus on the acoustics. Investing in surround sound will immerse you in the action on screen. Strategically place speakers around the room on nearby console tables or end tables and add a subwoofer if your budget allows.

Recessing speakers into your walls or ceiling will help them blend into the room and create an invisible, yet powerful effect. However, this can be expensive and hard to configure with existing drywall. A more manageable solution is to purchase a speaker system that matches your aesthetic and style. These electronics have come a long way since their classic black-box days and can be found in a range of colors and designs to fit into your room design perfectly.

Consider your lighting setup. Lighting and film have always been two sides of the same coin, so it’s no surprise that they’re equally important in media room setups. The right lighting is not only essential to set the ambience of a room, but also to make sure the screen is visible without glare. Professionals recommend LEDs, dimmers and recessed lights for an ideal setup. Contact a professional to get them installed in a glare-free way.

Natural light is welcomed in every room of the house, but you’ll want to keep glare in mind when positioning your TV in a room with windows. Blackout curtains might be helpful if there are limited locations for the TV.

Invest in sufficient media storage. With all the speakers and lights discussed above comes an issue of wires. Having eight speakers is great unless you’ll be tripping over and tangling up cords just to get to your seat. Recessed storage is an optimal solution, but it requires leading wires through walls. Thankfully, there are other ways to conceal wires and devices.

You can keep all your wired electronics hidden behind the door of a well-ventilated media cabinet or storage closet. This would be most useful if you have multiple accessories beyond a TV and speakers, such as a DVR, digital media player or video game console. Mounting the TV above a cabinet instead of placing it directly on top would also free up space and allow you to store supporting electronics on the top surface.

Lastly, commissioning a built-in media wall to fit all of your media components would give each of them an organized and structured home while creating storage space for movies, games and other decorations.

Plan out your furniture setup. This is the step that interior design comes to play in the most. Make sure that there is enough seating for everyone to sit and see the screen from their position. Sectional sofas are great for large audiences and you may even want to stock up on foldable chairs. Be sure to choose comfortable upholstery fabric since you’ll want something soft enough that you can sit through for hours during a movie marathon.

Consider placing a rug down on hardwood floors and switch out any wooden or hard plastic window blinds for fabric drapes. Avoiding hard surfaces is crucial to eliminating the “echo chamber” effect in many media spaces.

Lastly, pick the perfect coffee table for your space. It should be large enough to hold snacks, remote controls and even room for viewers to put their feet up if they wish to literally kick back and relax.",How to design a media room,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/16/how-to-design-media-room.html

The altered accounts from Officer Saharat Sampim and Sgt. Nicola Zodo have raised doubts about the official narrative of the shooting that resulted in the death of 19-year-old Roshad McIntosh, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Police have said McIntosh was shot on the back porch of a brick two-flat on the city's West Side. They said McIntosh fled on foot as numerous officers pulled up to investigate a tip about guns. He was shot after he pointed a gun at an officer, according to police.

The police surveillance video indicates both Sampim and Zodo were in different positions than they had reported. The events that led to the shooting weren't captured.

Questions surrounding the case came after Chicago's police oversight agency reopened the investigation in the summer at the request of McIntosh's family.

A federal lawsuit filed by the family alleges McIntosh was unarmed and tried to surrender when he was shot. However, police recovered a loaded pistol from the scene, and city lawyers also have photos of him displaying guns before his death.

Gen. George S. Patton was one of the most fascinating military figures to dominate the last century. Quite simply, he was a genius for war.

But at 11:45 on the morning of December 9, 1945, Gen. Patton was en route to a pheasant hunt near Mannheim, Germany, when his Cadillac staff car suddenly collided with a two-and-a-half ton U.S. Army truck. Twelve days later, the four-star general -- who had triumphed against Hitler's best from North Africa to Europe -- was dead. The Army concluded it was merely a traffic accident, but others believe it was an assassination attempt.

On VE Day May 8, 1945, American GIs were ready to return home. But George Patton wanted to keep fighting. The always-outspoken general was vocal about who his new enemy was: the Russians. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower disagreed, and so did many others in Washington.

Since President Donald Trump took office, he has been consistently strategic in working to dismantle the radical, leftwing legacy of his predecessor.

While the mainstream media has fixated on exaggerated day-to-day mini-controversies, the Trump Administration has methodically eliminated job-killing Obama-era regulations, filled judicial vacancies with solid conservatives at an astonishing pace, and accomplished real breakthroughs in trade relations with China and the Middle East.

Now, the President is going after another Obama-era creation: the dangerously unaccountable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Long time readers of this newsletter know that I have opposed the CFPB on constitutional and economic grounds for years. I’ve written about the agency’s mafia-like tactics as well as the threat its behavior poses to the rule of law. I have even testified before Congress about the danger this agency poses.

This CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and was largely designed by radical Senator Elizabeth Warren when she was an Obama advisor. Since the beginning, it has been used as a political weapon by the far Left as a way to intimidate businesses that the Left opposes ideologically.

The CFPB consistently oversteps its bounds. It is prohibited from regulating car deals, yet it does so anyway. It is prohibited from collecting personal data from consumers, yet it does so at a scale that rivals the NSA’s most controversial data gathering operations.

Further, the CFPB draws its funding from the Federal Reserve’s operating expenses rather than annual appropriations – making it unaccountable to Congress. The writers of Dodd-Frank also specified that the director could only be removed by the president – and only under specific circumstances. This undermines both congressional and executive powers.

After leaving the army in 2009, Cotton worked at the management consulting firm McKinsey and Company. A few years later, Cotton served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2013-2015, where he represented Arkansas’ 4th congressional district.

Cotton was endorsed by Arizona Gop Sen. John McCain when he decided to run for the seat in the House.

In 2014, Cotton was elected senator, replacing Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor.

Cotton’s Senate committee membership currently include the Banking Committee, where he chairs the Economic Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee, where he chairs the Air Land Power Subcommittee.

What is Cotton’s relationship with Trump?

Cotton has been a defender of Trump in the Senate. He supported Trump’s views on the Iran nuclear deal, and, like the president, is a supporter of stricter immigration laws and policies. He also defended Trump’s campaign promise to bring back waterboarding, arguing that the method is “not torture.”

Trump has also praised Cotton for the way he handles himself in TV interviews and deals with the press, the Daily Beast reported.

WHO IS REX TILLERSON?

“Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!” Trump tweeted in July of 2016.

What has been the reaction to Cotton’s potential move?

Critics argue that Cotton is too inexperienced or does not have enough relevant experience to head the nation’s top intelligence agency. If he becomes director, Cotton would become the youngest person to ever lead the CIA.

Indeed, “he is incredibly analytical, he is immersed in world affairs and he has a lot of good relationships” Jeremy Bash, the former chief of staff at the agency under Leon E. Panetta, told the New York Times.

But what is less clear, “is how he would click with the White House and the rest of the intelligence community, and whether or not he would be prepared to relinquish the role of a policymaker. He would really have to be prepared to park his policy views at the Langley gates,"" Bash added.

But Cotton supporters say that a move to CIA would be a good opportunity for the rising political star who may decide on a presidential run in the future.

“The Senate is a horrible place, who would want to spend their life there? Six years ago, he was a kid looking for a job and running for a House seat. People who are head of the CIA have a history of being vice-presidential nominees and going on to serve as presidents,” one Cotton ally told Politico.

George H.W. Bush served as the head of the CIA before become vice president and then president.

Cotton has declined to directly answer questions about the nomination. In a statement to Fox News, Cotton’s communications director, Caroline Tabler, said that Cotton’s “focus is on serving Arkansans in the Senate.”","Who is Tom Cotton, Trump's rumored CIA director pick?",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/01/who-is-tom-cotton-trumps-rumored-cia-director-pick.html

In its review of recidivism by criminal illegal immigrants, the paper looked at 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012.","The disturbing verdict in the killing of Kate Steinle – finding a criminal illegal alien not guilty of the most serious charges for her death – illustrates the need to find a way to end the “sanctuary cities” movement that has spread around the nation.

Steinle was only 32 when she was shot and killed in July 2015 by a bullet fired by illegal alien Jose Ines Garcia Garcia Zarate, who had a record of seven felony convictions and five previous deportations. Garcia Zarate did not deny shooting Steinle, but said it was an accident.

Garcia Zarate had been freed by San Francisco authorities three months before he shot Steinle, despite a federal immigration detention request to hold him so federal officials could take him into custody.

Now Garcia Zarate is, for the eighth time, a convicted felon – but he was found guilty Thursday of only illegal possession of a weapon. He was acquitted on the more serious charges of first- and second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and assault with a semi-automatic weapon.

Courtesy of American justice, Garcia Zarate had the full benefit of the due process of law conferred on American citizens – legal counsel at every step of the proceedings, an attentive judge, a jury of his peers, and the expectation that the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Steinle had none of those protections as she stood over the San Francisco Bay with her father, who would know her pleas for help as the last thing he’d ever hear her utter in a too-short life.

The case involving the young woman’s killing has spurred intense debate, Trump administration warnings to suspected sanctuary jurisdictions, lawsuits and proposed legislation on how U.S. immigration enforcement might proceed.

President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice have weighed in, proposing dramatically different immigration enforcement schemes than their predecessors.

The political left has staked out its position on immigration. An estimated 300 jurisdictions large and small have sanctuary policies that work to defeat cooperation by local law enforcement with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The federal agency describes its mission as enforcing “federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety.”

The sanctuary jurisdictions create opportunities for further harm, just like that posed by Steinle’s killer. Their claim is that sanctuary cities are actually as safe as or safer than others, with illegal residents less likely to break the law and more likely to cooperate with law enforcement when real crimes occur.

And sanctuary jurisdictions argue that immigration enforcement is the province of the federal government and they have no desire or intention of acting as agents or holding facilities for the feds.

But sanctuary supporters conveniently ignore the fact that disregarding an ICE detainer request and setting an illegal alien criminal free creates a very real threat that the criminal will commit crimes harming innocent victims in the future.

Kate Steinle’s tragic case is but one in a sea of unnecessary tears.

Earlier this year, The Washington Times reported on a Center for Immigration Studies analysis that found that from January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015, more than 17,000 ICE detainer requests were rejected by sanctuary jurisdictions.

Of those rejected requests, almost 70 percent were issued for individuals with a prior criminal history. That’s over 10,000 likely and confirmed criminal illegal aliens who ignored U.S. immigration law in how they came to be in this country, allegedly engaged in additional criminal conduct while here, and were returned to the streets rather than handed off to ICE.

This action, the left would have us believe, makes us safer rather than less safe. Over 10,000 times safer, if you follow the logic.

But there are holes in the logic. In reporting by the Boston Globe last year, the paper challenged statements by an Obama-era ICE director who was responsible for managing spin as the besieged agency itself released criminal illegal aliens inside U.S. borders.

In its review of recidivism by criminal illegal immigrants, the paper looked at 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012. It found as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation.

Last summer, police in Santa Rosa, California arrested 38-year-old Nery Israel Estrada-Margos for allegedly beating his girlfriend to death. Estrada-Margos had been in police custody before the murder for felony domestic battery charges after he allegedly beat his girlfriend following an argument.

Despite an ICE detainer request, police released Estrada-Margos from custody after he posted bail. Disingenuously claiming they tried to honor the ICE detainer request, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office released the suspected killer 16 minutes after notifying ICE, which was 60 miles away, of the pending release.

Veronica Cabrera Ramirez, Estrada-Margos’ girlfriend, didn’t have a voice in the sanctuary city debate. Her state is more interested in protecting people like Estrada-Margos from ICE than protecting her. It failed her and it is knowingly and intentionally failing others.

The stories of Kate Steinle and Veronica Cabrera Ramirez will fade with the passage of time. But theirs will simply be replaced by the stories of future victims of heinous and predictable crimes committed by criminal illegal aliens who take advantage of American kindness and weakness.

As we endure yet another “national conversation” – this one on border security and immigration – hundreds or perhaps thousands of new victims will fall prey to criminal illegal aliens upon whose intentions too many local jurisdictions and some states will place a losing bet.

In a Nov. 22 editorial, The Washington Post called Attorney General Sessions’ battle against sanctuary cities “pointless.” For Kate, Veronica and all those future victims of criminal illegal aliens, it’s anything but.",Kate Steinle's tragic death shows why the 'sanctuary cities' movement threatens the safety of all Americans,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/03/kate-steinles-tragic-death-shows-why-sanctuary-cities-movement-threatens-safety-all-americans.html

Fox 5 San Diego reported that the remains of Julia Jacobson and her box terrier, Boogie, were found in rural Riverside County. Ontario, Calif. police said a cadaver dog helped discover the shallow grave containing the bodies just south of Interstate 10.

Julia Jacobson and Boogie had not been seen since Sept. 2. Her SUV was found near her San Diego home with her keys in the ignition less than a week later. Detectives said forensic analysis of the car led police to conclude that she had been murdered.

A motive for Jacobson's murder has not been made public.

Jon Jacobson said the family received the news that his sister's body had been recovered during a memorial service in North Dakota Friday.

One of the fundamental problems in Washington is the attitude that the money that people make belongs to the government. That’s why you hear arguments about how much a tax cut “costs,” or big government advocates disingenuously and breathlessly complaining about the people who pay taxes getting a tax cut.

I believe it is the other way around. Our default position should be that the money you earn belongs to you, and government has to justify why it should take it from you.

Currently, there are at least 97 different federal taxes. The tax code that instructs people how they must hand over their hard-earned money to government spans some 74,000-plus pages.

This is absurd, and so is the fact that government will collect over $3 trillion from taxpayers next year but still is not satisfied.

Ross' suspension is effective immediately. ABC News spokeswoman Heather Riley would not comment on whether anyone else had been suspended in connection with the error.

During a live ""special report"" Friday morning, Ross reported that Flynn would testify that Donald Trump had ordered him to make contact with Russians about foreign policy while Trump was still a candidate. The report raised the specter of Trump's impeachment and sent the stock market plummeting.

Later in the day, ABC News -- part of the reliably liberal Disney ABC Television Network -- issued a ""clarification"" to Ross's report, saying that Trump's alleged directive came after he'd been elected president. That's a key distinction in any investigation of Russian actions during the campaign. Ross himself appeared on ""World News Tonight"" several hours after the initial report to clarify his error.

In a statement, ABC News said Ross' report ""had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process.""

""It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience,"" ABC's statement added. ""These are our core principles. We fell far short of that yesterday.""

Ross tweeted about his suspension late Saturday, saying, ""My job is to hold people accountable and that's why I agree with being held accountable myself.""

Trump himself tweeted, ""Congratulations to @ABC News"" for punishing Ross for what the president called ""his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt.

""More Networks and ""papers"" should do the same with their Fake News!"" Trump added.

Friday's fumble was another in a series of black marks for Ross, who has been at ABC News since 1994 after spending nearly two decades at NBC.

In 2001, Ross incorrectly reported that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi dictatorship may have been responsible for anthrax attacks that terrorized the United States in the months after 9/11. Then-White House press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted Saturday that he ""explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong.

""Brian Ross went with it anyway - and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction,"" Fleischer added.

In 2006, Ross reported that then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert was a target of a federal corruption probe involving former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Despite the Justice Department's denial, Ross insisted that Hastert was ""very much in the mix"" of the investigation. Hastert was never approached by prosecutors.

In 2010, Ross fronted a report called ""Taking on Toyota,"" which claimed that some of the Japanese automaker's cars contained a defect that caused ""unintended acceleration."" The report included footage of a tachometer shooting from 1,000 to 6,200 RPM in seconds while Ross sat behind the wheel. However, the same footage showed that the car Ross was sitting in was parked with the doors open at the time.

In a letter to ABC News at the time, Toyota complained that the work by a key expert Ross cited in his report was funded by ""a paid advocate for trial lawyers involved in litigation against Toyota."" The carmaker added that the expert's demonstrations were carried out ""under conditions that are virtually impossible to occur in real-world conditions.""

Perhaps most infamously, Ross reported in 2012 that Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes may have had ties to the Tea Party movement.

""There is a Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado page on the Colorado Tea Party site as well, talking about him joining the tea party last year,"" Ross reported on ""Good Morning America."" ""Now, we don’t know if this is the same Jim Holmes – but this is Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado.""

Ross later apologized for the report, but received withering criticism -- including being dubbed ""America's Wrongest Reporter"" by the now-defunct Gawker website.

""When there's breaking news, especially about terrorism and national security, ABC News' Brian Ross is there,"" John Cook wrote in a post on the gossip blog, before adding, ""And under no circumstances should you listen to anything he says.""

Sources tell Fox News that ABC has cut the size of Ross' team of producers and provided him with fewer on-air platforms for his reporting. An ABC insider said, however, that this had less to do with Ross' errors than with ABC's diminished interest in hard news and investigative reporting.

Reliably liberal ABC News has, however, continued its drumbeat of anti-Trump reporting, employing former Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos as its principal anchor. ABC's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz was called out by then-President elect Trump for crying on air on election night (she denies this), and former President Obama attended her second of three weddings.

ABC's beleaguered entertainment programming is also notoriously liberal, with the network recently shelling out an eye-popping $25 million to employ Clinton activist Katy Perry as a judge for a rebooted season of ""American Idol"".

Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger is widely reported to have ambitions to run for the White House himself and plans to step down prior to the 2020 and could challenge Trump as the Democratic nominee.

His tweet came after he also said on Twitter he fired Flynn because “he lied to the Vice President and the FBI” and compared the case to Hillary Clinton’s email scandal.

Comey, in his opening statement for the testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, said that Trump had asked him to back off the Flynn investigation during an Oval Office meeting on Feb 14. Flynn had already been fired from his position in the administration over revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about his communications with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.

The former FBI director said he did not tell Trump he would stop the probe.

Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his talks with Kislyak on Trump’s behalf. He was charged with one count of “willfully and knowingly” making false statements to the FBI.

Trump, speaking to reporters on Saturday, reiterated there was “absolutely no collusion” with the Russians.

“To put salt on the wound, we had another driver the next day that tossed the package. He tossed it instead of walking up the driveway,” said Bautista, adding that it landed on top of a rose bed. “It was a fragile porcelain figurine. It didn’t break.”

A representative with Amazon was “shocked” and profusely apologized for the second incident.

“I have lived in this home 17 years and I have never had back-to-back incident [like these],” Bautista added. “I am disappointed in how it was handled.”",Shock as Amazon delivery woman defecates on customer’s front yard while dropping off package,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/01/shock-as-amazon-delivery-woman-defecates-on-customer-s-front-yard-while-dropping-off-package.html

The new Viagra Connect will have the same major ingredient as regular Viagra, according to Fortune. Sales of Viagra have been declining since 2012, and Pfizer hopes an over-the-counter version will open a new revenue channel.

The drug maker has been pushing for the UK to reclassify Viagra as a non-prescription drug for nearly a decade. That finally happened courtesy of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Time reports.

“Erectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it’s important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care,” says Mick Foy of the MHRA.

The agency hopes allowing anyone over the age of 18 to purchase Viagra at the pharmacy will reduce the number of people who buy dangerous counterfeit erectile dysfunction medication.

Viagra Connect is the first non-prescription erectile dysfunction medication in the UK. It will cost approximately $27 for a four-pack.

If a bullet enters the eye socket, it often results in significant destruction of the socket, sinuses and brain, the report's authors noted. But in this case, the man experienced only limited damage to his eye socket because the bullet passed through a door first, which slowed it down, they said.

JAMES COMEY'S SECRET TWITTER ACCOUNT REVEALED

Last month, Comey finally acknowledged his Twitter account after months of speculation surrounding it.

Michael Flynn pleads guilty

The tweet comes after news that Michael Flynn, the embattled former national security advisor to President Trump, would plead guilty to lying to the FBI.

As part of the deal, Flynn has agreed to cooperate with the investigation Robert Mueller is handling, looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In court documents, Flynn states that an unnamed “senior official” in the Trump transition team directed him to contact nations including Russia over a United Nations vote – a discussion cited in the charging document Friday.

In a written statement, Flynn said ""it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of 'treason' and other outrageous acts.""

However, he said, ""I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.""

A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a drawn-out court battle.

In a statement, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said “nothing” about the plea implicates anyone other than Flynn.

He said: “The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.”

Comey firing

Comey was fired from his position as Director of the FBI in May of this year and eventually replaced by Christopher A. Wray, after being confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 2, 2017.

The former head of the FBI, who was appointed by President Obama, came under fire for his handling of the Clinton email probe -- and whose agency has been investigating whether Trump's campaign had ties to Russia.

“The FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions, and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,” Trump said in May, announcing his decision to replace Comey.

The president told Comey in a brief letter that he could not “effectively lead” the bureau and called for “new leadership that restores public trust and confidence” in law enforcement.

Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president’s decision was based on “the clear recommendations” of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

By L. Brent Bozell III, Fox News



So the top broadcast news journalist who raked the former top cable news journalist over sexual harassment has now been fired for sexual harassment. You can’t make this stuff up. Matt Lauer’s canned. As I write these words there is only a report from Variety that describes his alleged indiscretions, but one thing is for certain: NBC would not have fired their top star were this not an impeachable offense.

They’re dropping like bowling pins all over Hollywood, in sports, in politics and in journalism. Every day someone new is guilty of sexual harassment. While the deed is being reported, what is being swept under the rug is the raging hypocrisy.

There is no better example of the cynical mind at work than evidenced by these questions from Lauer to Bill O’Reilly during their Today Show interview on September 19.

He wanted O’Reilly to know what a lout he was: “[O’Reilly’s accusers] came forward and filed complaints against the biggest star at the network they worked at. Think of how intimidating that must have been, how nerve-racking that must have been! Doesn’t that tell you how strongly they felt about the way they were treated by you?”

He wanted to know if O’Reilly was truly repentant: “Over the last six months since your firing, have you done some soul searching? Have you done some self-reflection? And have you looked at the way you treated women that you think now or think about differently now than you did at the time?”

And then there was the topper: “You were probably the last guy in the world that they wanted to fire because you were the guy that the ratings and the revenues were built on, you carried that network on your shoulders for a lot of years. So doesn’t it seem safe to assume that the people at Fox News were given a piece of information or given some evidence that simply made it impossible for you to stay on at Fox News?”

How could Matt Lauer make these solemn pronouncements on national television with a straight face?

In a way he’s no different from Al Franken, or Harvey Weinstein, or Charlie Rose, or Bill Clinton, or Garrison Keillor or all those other liberals who publicly champion the rights of women at every opportunity while looking for every opportunity privately to torment them.

A direct conflict between the U.S. and Russia is a daily threat.

Two months ago, the Pentagon accused Russia of dropping bombs dangerously close to American special operations forces in eastern Syria. The U.S. issued a stern warning. In response, Russia threatened to retaliate if its troops came under fire by the U.S.

The two nations use a “de-confliction” hotline every day to share information about their operations in Syria, as military officers seek to avoid a mistake or miscalculation that could ignite a full-scale war between them.

Such a conflict is something neither side may want, but its two leaders may be powerless to prevent it. Why? Because of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s continuing investigation.

The longer the special counsel’s case drags on, the less likely it will be that President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin can sit down together in earnest to discuss key issues. These issues include diffusing the increasingly dangerous encounters in Syria, plus a myriad of other contentious topics that imperil American-Russian relations.

Gorbachev Issues Warning

Among those who are deeply concerned is Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. He recently described U.S.-Russia relations as having deteriorated into a “severe crisis,” warning that the nuclear arms control treaty that ended the Cold War is teetering on the precipice of collapse. Each side accuses the other of violating the terms of the treaty.

Writing in a Russian government newspaper, the former Soviet leader offered a dire prediction: “If the system of curbing nuclear arms crumbles, and that is exactly what the collapse of the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) treaty can lead to, the consequences will be catastrophic.”","Gregg Jarrett: Mueller's Investigation Imperils American-Russian Relations, Jeopardizing Lives",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/30/gregg-jarrett-muellers-investigation-imperils-american-russian-relations-jeopardizing

The Dec. 3rd full moon is considered a supermoon.
“A supermoon compared to the average moon is 14 percent larger but 30 percent brighter,” Petro said.
However, he explained that “the normal observer will not notice the difference from full moon to full moon.” Petro suggested people regularly watch the moon during different phases and look out for changes.
Faherty said to “just go outside and look at it.”“If you watch a moonrise, it’s not related to a supermoon but can give you an effect that you want,” she explained.","Look out for some changes in the sky on Sunday, when a supermoon will be visible.

“People can see it anywhere (as long as it’s not cloudy),” Dr. Noah Petro of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center told Fox News via email. “Unlike the solar eclipse, you don’t have to be in (sic) particular spot to see it. Just go out after dark and look up!”

Read on for a look at the science behind the phenomenon and what you should know about watching it.

What is a supermoon?

Astrologer Richard Nolle came up with the word. His definition, via EarthSky, is when there is “... a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90% of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit.”

It's “a very weird definition,” Dr. Jackie Faherty, a senior scientist in the department of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, told Fox News.

She said that “there’s not really a good example of the superest of the supermoons.”

“Some of them will be much closer than others,” Faherty said.

Three new moons earlier this year -- in addition to Sunday’s full moon -- meet Nolle's criteria for supermoons, EarthSky reports.

“The definition we at Goddard use is the closest full Moon in a 14 month cycle, so once every 14 months,” Petro wrote. The Dec. 3rd full moon is considered a supermoon.

“If you use a looser definition of the full Moons when it’s within 90% of being closest (which appears to be the common definition) then there are multiple super moons in a year, which makes it much less rare,” he explained.

“A supermoon compared to the average moon is 14 percent larger but 30 percent brighter,” Petro said.

However, he explained that “the normal observer will not notice the difference from full moon to full moon.” Petro suggested people regularly watch the moon during different phases and look out for changes.

“It is a closer full moon than what you’d be used to, but not one that you’d be paying particular attention to,” Faherty said.

How can I see the supermoon?

Faherty said to “just go outside and look at it.”

“If you watch a moonrise, it’s not related to a supermoon but can give you an effect that you want,” she explained. When the moon is on the horizon, there's an optical illusion where it seems bigger.

You'll need to have “a clear view to the horizon,” Faherty said. You can use the U.S. Naval Observatory website to search for moonrise times in your area.",How to watch the supermoon,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/11/30/how-to-watch-supermoon.html

In 2006, Ross reported that then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert was a target of a federal corruption probe involving former lobbyist Jack Abramoff.","ABC News announced Saturday that Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross had been suspended for four weeks without pay over a botched ""exclusive"" about former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Ross' suspension is effective immediately. ABC News spokeswoman Heather Riley would not comment on whether anyone else had been suspended in connection with the error.

During a live ""special report"" Friday morning, Ross reported that Flynn would testify that Donald Trump had ordered him to make contact with Russians about foreign policy while Trump was still a candidate. The report raised the specter of Trump's impeachment and sent the stock market plummeting.

Later in the day, ABC News -- part of the reliably liberal Disney ABC Television Network -- issued a ""clarification"" to Ross's report, saying that Trump's alleged directive came after he'd been elected president. That's a key distinction in any investigation of Russian actions during the campaign. Ross himself appeared on ""World News Tonight"" several hours after the initial report to clarify his error.

In a statement, ABC News said Ross' report ""had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process.""

""It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience,"" ABC's statement added. ""These are our core principles. We fell far short of that yesterday.""

Ross tweeted about his suspension late Saturday, saying, ""My job is to hold people accountable and that's why I agree with being held accountable myself.""

Trump himself tweeted, ""Congratulations to @ABC News"" for punishing Ross for what the president called ""his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt.

""More Networks and ""papers"" should do the same with their Fake News!"" Trump added.

Friday's fumble was another in a series of black marks for Ross, who has been at ABC News since 1994 after spending nearly two decades at NBC.

In 2001, Ross incorrectly reported that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi dictatorship may have been responsible for anthrax attacks that terrorized the United States in the months after 9/11. Then-White House press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted Saturday that he ""explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong.

""Brian Ross went with it anyway - and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction,"" Fleischer added.

In 2006, Ross reported that then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert was a target of a federal corruption probe involving former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Despite the Justice Department's denial, Ross insisted that Hastert was ""very much in the mix"" of the investigation. Hastert was never approached by prosecutors.

In 2010, Ross fronted a report called ""Taking on Toyota,"" which claimed that some of the Japanese automaker's cars contained a defect that caused ""unintended acceleration."" The report included footage of a tachometer shooting from 1,000 to 6,200 RPM in seconds while Ross sat behind the wheel. However, the same footage showed that the car Ross was sitting in was parked with the doors open at the time.

In a letter to ABC News at the time, Toyota complained that the work by a key expert Ross cited in his report was funded by ""a paid advocate for trial lawyers involved in litigation against Toyota."" The carmaker added that the expert's demonstrations were carried out ""under conditions that are virtually impossible to occur in real-world conditions.""

Perhaps most infamously, Ross reported in 2012 that Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes may have had ties to the Tea Party movement.

""There is a Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado page on the Colorado Tea Party site as well, talking about him joining the tea party last year,"" Ross reported on ""Good Morning America."" ""Now, we don’t know if this is the same Jim Holmes – but this is Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado.""

Ross later apologized for the report, but received withering criticism -- including being dubbed ""America's Wrongest Reporter"" by the now-defunct Gawker website.

""When there's breaking news, especially about terrorism and national security, ABC News' Brian Ross is there,"" John Cook wrote in a post on the gossip blog, before adding, ""And under no circumstances should you listen to anything he says.""

Sources tell Fox News that ABC has cut the size of Ross' team of producers and provided him with fewer on-air platforms for his reporting. An ABC insider said, however, that this had less to do with Ross' errors than with ABC's diminished interest in hard news and investigative reporting.

Reliably liberal ABC News has, however, continued its drumbeat of anti-Trump reporting, employing former Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos as its principal anchor. ABC's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz was called out by then-President elect Trump for crying on air on election night (she denies this), and former President Obama attended her second of three weddings.

ABC's beleaguered entertainment programming is also notoriously liberal, with the network recently shelling out an eye-popping $25 million to employ Clinton activist Katy Perry as a judge for a rebooted season of ""American Idol"".

Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger is widely reported to have ambitions to run for the White House himself and plans to step down prior to the 2020 and could challenge Trump as the Democratic nominee.

Speech restrictions rarely survive strict scrutiny at the Supreme Court.","The upcoming Supreme Court argument about a baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple makes some civil rights lawyers think of South Carolina's Piggie Park barbecue.

When two African-Americans parked their car at a Piggie Park drive-in in August 1964 in Columbia, South Carolina, the waitress who came out to serve them turned back once she saw they were black and didn't take their order.

In the civil rights lawsuit that followed, Piggie Park owner Maurice Bessinger justified the refusal to serve black customers based on his religious belief opposing ""any integration of the races whatsoever.""

Federal judges had little trouble dismissing Bessinger's claim.

""Undoubtedly defendant Bessinger has a constitutional right to espouse the religious beliefs of his own choosing, however, he does not have the absolute right to exercise and practice such beliefs in utter disregard of the clear constitutional rights of other citizens,"" U.S. District Judge Charles Earl Simons Jr. wrote in 1966.

By the time the Supreme Court heard the case in 1968, the issue was the award of fees to the lawyers representing the black South Carolinians who sued Bessinger's restaurants. But in a footnote to its unsigned 8-0 opinion, the court called the religious freedom argument and Bessinger's other defenses ""patently frivolous.""

Fifty years later, civil rights lawyers are pointing the Supreme Court to Bessinger's case in support of Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the gay couple who were turned away by Colorado baker Jack Phillips, giving rise to the high court case that will be argued Tuesday.

""The logic of Piggie Park and other precedents overwhelmingly rejecting religious justifications for racial discrimination apply squarely to the context of LGBTQ discrimination,"" the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said in a Supreme Court brief. The fund also represented the people who sued Piggie Park.

Both cases involve laws intended to prevent discrimination by private businesses that open their doors to the public. In the case of Piggie Park, the law was the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The bake shop case involves the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits businesses from refusing to sell their goods to people on the basis of sexual orientation among other things.

As the case has come to the justices, the focus is on Phillips' speech rights, not his religious beliefs. As a cake artist, he claims a right not to say something with which he disagrees.

Phillips' lawyers also say the baker's issue is not with gay people, but rather same-sex marriage. He will sell any pre-made goods to anyone who walks in the store, lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing Phillips, said. He also would make a cake celebrating ""a marriage between a man and a woman even if one or both spouses identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual,"" his lawyers wrote.

Laws that regulate speech, as Phillips' team asserts the Colorado anti-discrimination law does, often must withstand the toughest level of review that courts can apply, known as strict scrutiny. His lawyers rely on a 1995 unanimous Supreme Court decision allowing organizers of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston to exclude a gay rights group from the parade.

Speech restrictions rarely survive strict scrutiny at the Supreme Court.

But both Phillips and the Trump administration, which entered the case on Phillips' side, said speech restrictions aimed at race might be different.

A ruling for the baker would not call into question the use of public accommodations laws to prohibit racial discrimination, the administration said in its Supreme Court brief. ""As the court recently observed, 'racial bias' is 'a familiar and recurring evil' that poses 'unique historical, constitutional and institutional concerns,'"" the administration said, quoting from a decision this year in a case about racial discrimination among jurors.",Some see echoes of '68 court case in wedding cake dispute,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/03/some-see-echoes-68-court-case-in-wedding-cake-dispute.html

“There's a real grave danger to China, to Russia, to all nations, by -- you know, from a North Korea that's armed with nuclear weapons.","National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster says neither the American people nor U.S. allies should question the stability of the Trump administration amid his predecessor Michael Flynn’s guilty plea and rumors Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is stepping down.

“No, I don't think our allies need any reassurance,” McMaster told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “In fact, what we're doing is continuing to work with them on all the key challenges we face today -- from North Korea, to the defeat of ISIS across the Greater Middle East -- the ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, too.”

McMaster reiterated that President Trump’s main priority is to protect American interests at home and abroad.

Tillerson will continue to be a part of that effort, McMaster said.

“I'm not aware of any plan at all” for Tillerson to resign, he said.

Wallace also asked McMaster about the president’s recent retweets of online posts linked to “Britain First,” a far-right group in the United Kingdom.

Last week, Trump retweeted a video that purported to show Muslim immigrants committing acts of violence. Those depicted in the footage reportedly were European-born.

Wallace noted that many British leaders – including Prime Minister Theresa May – voiced outrage at Trump, saying the president had “got it wrong” and risked needlessly stirring racial and ethnic discord.

“General, why did President Trump send out those videos?” Wallace asked.

“Well, President Trump is the best judge of why he did that,” McMaster said. “I know it was his intention to highlight the importance of creating safe and secure environments for our citizens -- to make sure that we have the right laws in place, enforcement mechanisms in place.”

Wallace then suggested that between the Britain First retweets and Trump’s support for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the president might be tossing away any hope of achieving Middle East peace during his presidency.

“No, the president's not giving up on the Mideast peace agreement at all,” McMaster said.

“There are options involving the move of an embassy at some point in the future, which I think, you know, could be used to gain momentum toward a -- toward a peace agreement, and a solution that works both for Israelis and for Palestinians,” McMaster added.

McMaster also addressed North Korea.

Last week, North Korea launched its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile – a provocation to which President Trump replied, “I will only tell you that we will take care of it.”

How exactly would the president “take care of it” given China and Russia’s complicity in propping up the regime, Wallace asked.

“Well, the president's going to take care of it by, if we have to, doing more ourselves,” McMaster said. “But what we want to do is convince others it is in their interest to do more.

“China, as you know, has taken some unprecedented actions. And what we're asking China to do is, not do us or anybody else a favor, but to act in China's interest.

“There's a real grave danger to China, to Russia, to all nations, by -- you know, from a North Korea that's armed with nuclear weapons. And of course, you have that direct threat, but you also have the threat of -- the potential of Japan, South Korea, others, arming themselves, possibly even with nuclear weapons. That is not in China's interest; it's not in Russia's interest.

“And so, what the president's saying is, we all need to take care of it. If necessary, the president and the United States will have to take care of it, because he has said he's not going to allow this murderous, rogue regime to threaten the United States with the most destructive weapons on the planet.”

Let them raise funds, create awareness, or even – if your kids are especially enterprising – start their own organization to help.
Exercises like these foster a sense of awareness in your kids that the world is bigger than their immediate neighborhood.
So this Thanksgiving, sure, pile on the turkey, the stuffing, the cranberries and the pumpkin pie.
But teach your kids that there’s nothing more satisfying than gratitude, and they will remain grounded, happy and useful for the rest of their lives.","In Richard Kirshenbaum’s book about Manhattan’s uber-wealthy, “Isn’t That Rich?,” a father sighs: “I wish I had my son’s childhood, and I wish he had mine.” That’s the challenge for affluent parents who want to give their kids the world, but not destroy their initiative.

The issue comes to a head at Thanksgiving time, when gratitude so often slides off the menu in favor of turkey, football, and gearing up for Black Friday shopping, which sadly begins now on Thursday nights.

So how can parents walk that fine line between instilling proper values in their children, while at the same time not coming across as annoying, preachy or worse? Sentences that begin “when I was your age” are usually the last things your kids want to hear.

Here are three ways to serve up gratitude (the real meaning of Thanksgiving) along with the turkey and trimmings:

First, teach your kids the meaning of “give before you get.”

If your kids expect to get any presents at holiday time in December, they need to start giving now. Some parents like to give their kids a small amount of money – say, $10 or $20 for doing some household chores – and then ask them to pick out a charitable organization that reflects their values.

Then ask your child to donate the money to the organization he or she has selected and write you a note explaining the reasons for selecting that particular charity.

Why is this so important?

There are two kinds of poverty – absolute and relative. Absolute poverty means that you’re part of the “bottom billion,” living on $2 or $3 a day. Relative poverty means that you still have the iPhone 7 when your friends have the 8, or worse still, the X.

The remarkable thing about relative poverty is it can feel even worse than absolute poverty to people living in a materialistic culture. After all, if you’re living in real poverty, chances are, so is everyone else around you. All knowledge is by contrast.

If you and your kids are fortunate enough to be living in a nice neighborhood where people have a lot, sometimes your kids may feel as though they don’t quite measure up materially because other families might have more.

So the idea of identifying places to give puts your kids in touch with the reality that others have less, and often far less.

Second, have your kids pick a cause.

If your kids are unsure about what charity to support, offer them this idea developed by Salt Lake City financial adviser and author Lee Brower: Give them a newspaper – it may be the first time they’ve ever held one – and ask them to find stories they consider disturbing.

The stories might have to do with any issue from poverty to child abuse, from violence against women to whatever else is going on in the world. There is certainly no shortage of troubling issues.

Have your kids each choose one such issue or cause and make it that child’s cause for the current year. Let them raise funds, create awareness, or even – if your kids are especially enterprising – start their own organization to help.

Exercises like these foster a sense of awareness in your kids that the world is bigger than their immediate neighborhood. They’ll realize that life will go on even if they don’t have the particular outfit or basketball shoes their classmates have, and they can experience as much joy from giving as from receiving.

Third, stop shopping for yourself.

In our society, we love “retail therapy” – as in, when the going gets tough, the tough go shopping. Our kids see all that new stuff walking into the house, all those boxes from Amazon, all the things we buy for ourselves in order to make ourselves feel better (as if our lives were all that bad, which they aren’t).

And yet, life isn’t about the accumulation of riches. In the words of Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman, creators of the “Type A” concept of heart disease, when all we think about are possessions, we just become “a more prestigious caretaker.”

So this holiday season, give the credit cards a rest. Demonstrate through your actions that happiness doesn’t require keeping up with the Joneses. Instead, in the words of Quentin Crisp, author of “The Naked Civil Servant,” you should “drag the Joneses down to your level.”

In sum, life is all about flow, giving and receiving.

Kids only get spoiled when they think that the world exists to serve them and meet their needs. They should learn that in reality, true happiness comes from recognizing and meeting the needs of others.

The best way to combat what Warren Buffett calls “affluenza” is to teach our kids that giving is just as satisfying as receiving, and that nothing that arrives from Amazon or any other retailer is as meaningful as knowing that you made a difference in the lives of others.

So this Thanksgiving, sure, pile on the turkey, the stuffing, the cranberries and the pumpkin pie. But teach your kids that there’s nothing more satisfying than gratitude, and they will remain grounded, happy and useful for the rest of their lives.","Thanksgiving recipe: Turkey, stuffing, and great values for your kids",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/17/thanksgiving-recipe-turkey-stuffing-and-great-values-for-your-kids.html

'ME TOO' TRENDING ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOLLOWING RECENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OUTRAGE

On Friday the “Today” show kicked off its 8 a.m. hour with a #MeToo segment just days after the morning show fired its biggest star, Matt Lauer, following sexual misconduct allegations.

The roots of #MeToo are in a movement started over a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke to harness “empowerment through empathy” for victims of sexual assault. In 2006, Burke founded Just Be Inc., a youth organization focused on the “health, wellbeing and wholeness of young women of color.”

The hashtag #MeToo began trending on social media last month after actress Alyssa Milano asked victims of sexual harassment and violence to let their voices be heard.

From Oct. 10 to Dec. 1, he explained, #MeToo has been mentioned 312,000 times across social platforms, with a reach of 1.1 billion. Some 54 percent of that conversation is coming from females. Nearly 58 percent of those using the #MeToo tag are in the U.S, he said.

“Social media has enabled men and women to, in many ways, not feel alone and give a loud warning to those who have committed these terrible acts that this is no longer going to be accepted or ignored,” he said.

His T-shirt was ripped. He was hungry. He was not well-cared for. He had never been to school. We don’t know exactly why his legs have never worked, but our best guess is that he had some sort of traumatic injury at birth.

I am sharing Chinyelo’s remarkable story now because Sunday is International Day of Persons with Disabilities, created by the United Nations in 1992. It is a day to think about people who don’t get the attention they deserve.

In the culture in Thomazeau, Haiti, Chinyelo is seen as cursed. Because of this he is viewed as worthless. People treat him and others with disabilities poorly, because they believe he doesn’t matter.

One of my other disabled friends in Haiti has been raped repeatedly because it is believed to bring good luck to rape a disabled person before buying a lottery ticket or making a business venture.

When the faith-based organization where I work – LiveBeyond – began humanitarian work in Haiti, we saw the abysmal circumstances of so many disabled people and we couldn’t stand by and do nothing. Especially not with our legacy.

LiveBeyond’s co-founder, Laurie Stallings Vanderpool, had a younger brother – John Mark “Johnny” Stallings – who was born with Down syndrome. At the hospital, his parents – legendary football coach Gene Stallings and his wife, Ruth Ann – were told they should send him off to an asylum.

The Stallings were told that Johnny’s heart condition would not allow him to make it past his first year. These loving parents decided to disregard the doctor’s advice and took him home with the rest of their family.

Johnny Stallings brought light to the Stallings family for 46 years before he passed away in 2008. He was the absolute joy of his family. But his light spread even farther than his family. Coach Stallings took Johnny to football practices and games and became an advocate for those with special needs, particularly those at the RISE Program at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

Johnny made friends with everyone he met. Faulkner University named its football field after him. The University of Alabama named its equipment room in his honor. He accomplished so much in his lifetime – and his legacy lives on.

We started the Johnny’s Kids program at LiveBeyond to honor Johnny’s memory. We provide physical and occupational therapy, educational opportunities, Bible lessons, nutritional support, sports activities and friendship to the children in the program.

Soon we will break ground on Johnny’s House, a facility for the disabled in Haiti who don’t have a support system. It will be a safe place for them to live, work and learn free of danger.

Thankfully, we are not the only ones who noticed this issue. In Haiti. myLIFEspeaks offers special education classes for 22 children with disabilities and offers physical and occupational therapy to disabled adults and children. The organization also holds a Night to Shine in conjunction with the Tim Tebow Foundation.

Now when I think of Chinyelo, I think of an athletic boy who loves to learn, play and compete with his best friend Pierre Richard, who has a similar condition. I love watching them race wheelchairs, tone their muscles on obstacle courses and play soccer.

They both began attending school this year and are making astronomical progress. They have changed so much in the few years that I’ve known them. These two boys don’t let anything hold them back. We shouldn’t either.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



Democrats have a lot to say about the Republican tax-reform plan, including that it is a “middle class con job” and is going to cost the GOP its congressional majorities. That’s quite the bold claim, coming from the party that is in fact in uncharted tax-politics territory.

Americans have short political memories, which means it is no longer possible to remember a world in which Democrats didn’t hate tax cuts. And in the mainstream media—which shares the left’s penchant for class warfare—it’s also no longer possible to read an analysis that doesn’t assume Democrats are on the right side of history, that these tax cuts are “unpopular,” and that this reform holds grave political risks for Republicans.

Based on what? Democrats certainly have no modern evidence of these propositions, since they’ve never uniformly opposed tax cuts. In fact, it’s been 16 years since the party even engaged in a big tax brawl, during George W. Bush’s first year as president. What’s striking is just how many Democrats enthusiastically signed on to Mr. Bush’s tax bill, and just how far off the political rails the party has gone in the intervening years.

While the Bush tax package was hardly as sweeping as today’s reform, it contained similar provisions. It cut marginal rates across the board, even knocking nearly 5 points off the top marginal rate for the 1%. It cut capital-gains taxes and lowered the estate tax to zero in 2010, before the reductions expired.

Coffey responded with a layup and foul to push the lead to 86-80, only to see Smith's dunk bring the Crimson Tide within four.

McBrayer knocked down two free throws with 18 seconds remaining and Michael Hurt's free throw increased Minnesota's lead to 89-83, before Sexton made two free throws with 1 second remaining.

The week has lent itself to a feeling of instability.

Approximately 85 percent of the Mars 2020 rover will be based on the original Curiosity rover, which landed in 2012.
NASA FINDS POTENTIAL 'CRADLE OF LIFE' ON MARS IN SHOCKING DISCOVERYThe Mars Curiosity rover cost an estimated $2.5 billion in 2012 dollars, according to various media reports.
In 2016, NASA officials said the Mars 2020 rover mission would cost $2.1 billion, according to Space News.
“Our next instruments will build on the success of [Mars Science Laboratory], which was a proving ground for new technology,” said George Tahu, NASA’s Mars 2020 program executive.","Space is the final frontier. And if NASA has its way, its new Mars rover may be able to go where no man has gone before and find signs of ancient life – and not just ones that lived a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

NASA is working on the next version of its Curiosity Mars rover, according to a announcement made this week. The new rover will look a lot like its predecessor, but will have a very different mission, including looking for signs of ancient life in terrain that is presently inhospitable, but had lakes and rivers 3.5 billion years ago.

The rover, dubbed Mars 2020, will look for signs of microbial life using tools such as an x-ray spectrometer that can look for spots the size of a gain of table salt. It will also have an ultraviolet laser used to detect what NASA describes as ""the 'glow' from excited rings of carbon atoms."" There will also be ground-penetrating radar to look under the surface of Mars, including mapping layers of rock, water and ice up to 30 feet deep, all designed to help NASA stay on target.

SCIENTISTS SEND SECRET MESSAGE TO ALIENS IN NEW SEARCH FOR INTELLIGENT LIFE

“Whether life ever existed beyond Earth is one of the grand questions humans seek to answer,” said NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Mars 2020’s project scientist Ken Farley. “What we learn from the samples collected during this mission has the potential to address whether we’re alone in the universe.”

The new rover will come with seven new instruments, new wheels and additional autonomy, the government agency announced. Approximately 85 percent of the Mars 2020 rover will be based on the original Curiosity rover, which landed in 2012.

""The fact that so much of the hardware has already been designed -- or even already exists -- is a major advantage for this mission,"" Jim Watzin, director of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, added. ""It saves us money, time and most of all, reduces risk.""

NASA FINDS POTENTIAL 'CRADLE OF LIFE' ON MARS IN SHOCKING DISCOVERY

The Mars Curiosity rover cost an estimated $2.5 billion in 2012 dollars, according to various media reports. In 2016, NASA officials said the Mars 2020 rover mission would cost $2.1 billion, according to Space News.

In addition to the aforementioned features, the new rover will also sport a drill used to ""capture rock cores, while a caching system with a miniature robotic arm will seal up these samples.""

Other upgrades include a new cruise stage so the rover can fly to Mars and new landing technology (JPL describes it as a ""sky crane), color cameras, a zoom lens and a laser to vaporize rocks and soil to analyze their chemistry.

“Our next instruments will build on the success of [Mars Science Laboratory], which was a proving ground for new technology,” said George Tahu, NASA’s Mars 2020 program executive. “These will gather science data in ways that weren’t possible before.”

If you are inclined to commit a heinous crime, San Francisco is the place for you.

You can sneak into City Hall armed with a .38-caliber revolver, murder the mayor and a supervisor in cold blood, and get away with it. All you need to do is conjure some preposterous defense. Blame it on an excessive consumption of junk food like Twinkies and you can beat the rap. You know… eat a Twinkie and commit murder. A San Francisco jury will lap it up.So, it should come as no surprise that the killer of Kate Steinle was acquitted Thursday of murder and involuntarily manslaughter.

Jose Ines Garcia Zarate and his lawyers invented a ludicrous defense by claiming “the gun just went off” by itself, ending the life of a 32-year-old woman who was walking along a pier with her father. It was a perfect defense for a notoriously liberal city – guns kill, not people.

Employees at Cash’s Liquor Store in Fort Walton Beach went back to work the day after Thanksgiving and discovered a strange sight: an opossum next to a broken and empty bottle of bourbon.

Owner Cash Moore told Northwest Florida Daily News this was the first time he’s experienced an opossum break-in at his business.

""She came in from the outside and was up in the rafters, and when she came through she knocked a bottle of liquor off the shelf,"" Moore told Northwest Florida Daily. ""When she got down on the floor she drank the whole damn bottle.”

Michelle Pettis, a technician at Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge, said the female opossum, who was brought in by a police officer, appeared pale and disoriented and was salivating excessively.

“A worker there found the opossum up on a shelf next to a cracked open bottle of liquor with nothing in it,” Pettis told the newspaper. “Assuming the opossum drank it all, he brought her to us, and we looked over her and she definitely wasn’t fully acting normal.”

The staff pumped the marsupial with fluids to flush out the alcohol in her system. She sobered up in a few days and was released on Thursday unharmed.

The opossum also appeared to have escaped a dreadful hangover, according to Pettis.

It’s still unclear how the animale broke into Cash’s. Pettis described the animal as “fairly large.”

The refuge center posted on its Facebook page Friday a photo of the opossum with the caption: “On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: a drunk opossum in a box!

There are sexual harassers, and then there is John Conyers, the Democrat from Detroit who made his congressional office an adjunct of his libido.

The evidence suggests Conyers believed that as a 27-term congressman he was entitled to the Washingon, DC, equivalent of the Ottoman Imperial Harem.

He routinely hit on his female staffers and his office was a den of sexual intrigue — allegedly featuring a jealous wife and a vindictive mistress — that properly belongs in a Bravo reality show if the network ever extends its “Real Housewives” franchise to Capitol Hill.

A political party is rarely provided an easier test case for its bona fides. Conyers is an 88-year-old man who finds it increasingly difficult to carry out his duties. He holds an exceedingly safe seat that, should he resign, will be taken over by another reliably progressive Democrat. In this case, the political cost to the party of showing that it’s serious about “zero tolerance” for sexual harassment is almost nil.

Yet House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, when asked about Conyers on “Meet the Press,” mumbled and looked at her shoes. She wasn’t able to summon any dudgeon, let alone high dudgeon, about Conyers. The harshest thing she said is that, “as John reviews his case — which he knows, which I don’t — I believe he will do the right thing.”

Oh, really? Conyers did step down as the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. Otherwise, his careful review of his own case has produced categorical denials that even Pelosi must find incredible.",Rich Lowry: The Case of John Conyers Shows What Democrats Really Think About Harassment,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/28/rich-lowry-case-john-conyers-shows-what-democrats-really-think-about-harassment

And that July meeting led to what NBC reported last week was Tillerson telling colleagues that his boss is a ""moron.""
Trump has denied the stories, sometimes with backing from top officials, and turned his ire on the media.
He called the NBC nuclear meeting ""pure fiction"" and said he believes the sources are made up.
I don't think Trump really wants to go down that road.","A Washington Post story yesterday described President Trump as really, really mad. In fact, he was said to be ""livid.""

That, the story said, was at a July meeting when he asked Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis and others why he should prop up the Obama nuclear agreement with Iran when he considered it a disaster.

""'He threw a fit,’ said one person familiar with the meeting. ""... He was furious. Really furious. It’s clear he felt jammed.""

So H.R. McMaster came up with a plan to get Trump to ""compromise,"" the Post says.

The key thing here—beyond the geopolitical implications of decertifying the Iran deal—is that unnamed sources are portraying the president as a hothead who has to be schooled by his top aides.

The same theme was struck in the NBC report that Trump ""said he wanted what amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal during a gathering this past summer of the nation’s highest-ranking national security leaders, according to three officials who were in the room."" The president had to be told that the stockpile has been dramatically reduced since the 1960s because of arms-control agreements.

And that July meeting led to what NBC reported last week was Tillerson telling colleagues that his boss is a ""moron."" (His spokeswoman denied this after the secretary of State declined to address it at a news conference.)

This is the emerging media narrative about Trump: that he's constantly getting mad, that he doesn't know much about foreign policy, and that his generals and advisers have to save him from himself.

Think for a moment about the motivation of the sources who whisper these details to reporters: Are they trying to make the boss look bad, or build themselves up? And if they were engaged in a conscious strategy, wouldn't it be better to do it quietly?

Trump has denied the stories, sometimes with backing from top officials, and turned his ire on the media. He called the NBC nuclear meeting ""pure fiction"" and said he believes the sources are made up. NBC anchor Lester Holt says the network had three sources in the room.

In escalating his attacks on ""fake news,"" the president is now suggesting that the government take action, tweeting:

""Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!""

In fact, the FCC doesn't license national networks, only local stations. And those decisions are supposed to be based on community service, not news content. So that's a non-starter.

The president has every right to complain about negative or distorted coverage, but talking about lifting licenses, in a country with a First Amendment, is troubling.

I don't think Trump really wants to go down that road. He is known for venting his displeasure with the press in very strong terms. He may or may not be mad in White House meetings, but he's clearly quite angry with the media.","Trump rips NBC, eyes TV licenses, but is he serious?",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/13/trump-rips-nbc-eyes-tv-licenses-but-is-serious.html

Are you Michigan or Ohio State?","American politics is really pretty simple. One can distill the American political experience into a singular, collegiate athletic series, historically played at the end of the year by two of the country’s most-storied football programs, Michigan and Ohio, alternately in Ann Arbor or Columbus, respectively.

If you’re a Michigan partisan, you could lose every game for the rest of the season. The only thing that matters is defeating the Buckeyes at the end of the year in the Big House.

If you pull for Ohio State, who cares about the detritus of Purdue, Northwestern, Illinois, Minnesota and Iowa. But all is forgiven if OSU topples the Wolverines at the Horseshoe under grey skies of late November.

Kids may pick a team based on how cool the uniforms look. Some people here in Washington fell in love with Cincinnati Bengals as children, transfixed by the team’s striped helmets.

Others gravitated toward the Seattle Seahawks and their forest green/royal blue get-ups, circa Jim Zorn/Efren Herrera. But mostly, people cheer for teams just because they’re nearby. There is no other logic.

It is said all politics is local. But sports has that beat. People just instinctively root for the local teams. There’s often little logical explanation.

This brings us to American politics. Everyone just picks a side. You like ObamaCare or not?

How about the Republican tax bill? Hillary Clinton or President Trump?

Should Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore stay in the race? Or should there be swift justice instead for Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.? Each of them face accusations of sexual misconduct.

This is where things grow more complicated.

But how many people have sided with either Michigan or Ohio State -- just because they are fans of either school.

Some Republicans will back Moore simply because it’s believed he will serve as a reliable GOP vote to help execute President Trump’s agenda. Tax reform? Check. Supreme Court nominees? Check. Oppose abortion? Check.

What about those decades-old allegations?

Yes. But some in the GOP argue that the party needs Moore’s vote to advance tax reform. Moore faces Democratic nominee Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 special general election for the Senate seat of former GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions.

And by the way, what about this revisionism now among some feminists and others who are now questioning their support for former President Bill Clinton when Republicans impeached him nearly two decades ago?

Are you Michigan or Ohio State?

Think Moore deserves due process? Firm critics don’t, which shows side-picking even within political parties.

But those out to get Moore want to show him the door even before he arrives in Washington. Yet when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared last week on NBC that Conyers deserves “due process,” the same voices who support Moore excoriate the California Democrat.

Hail to the Victors? Or Script Ohio?

Remember when Republicans used to torch Pelosi for infamously proclaiming: “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it” when it came to ObamaCare. The GOP still howl about that one as Democrats circled the wagons.

Then Democrats were all up in arms when House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., suggested that voters would side with Republicans once congressional GOP-ers usher their tax bill across the finish line.

And if you’re a Michigan fan, you probably loved that Ohio State canned coach Woody Hayes after he cold-cocked the Clemson linebacker in the 1978 Gator Bowl.

Democrats made few inroads into Republicans’ House majority in 2016. Then they failed to claim a single win in several special elections earlier this year.

To be fair, the contests heavily favored the GOP. Still, Democrats thought they might at least escape with one or two victories.

They lost in Kansas for the open seat of GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo, who left Congress to become the CIA director. Then came the loss in Montana, even after GOP candidate Greg Gianforte body slammed a reporter, followed losses in South Carolina and Georgia.

The losses ignited a furor among Democrats, with some questioning the leadership of Pelosi.

Kind of like Michigan fans calling out coach Jim Harbaugh after his third consecutive loss to the scarlet and gray.

But Harbaugh still has job. So does Pelosi.

Go Blue?

Deficits? Well, Republicans lit into Democrats for years over exploding deficits. But when it comes to tax reform, many Republicans are now willing to concede at least $1.5 trillion in deficit spending due to tax reform – with the hope that economic growth will pull the country out of the red.

Republicans certainly didn’t say that when congressional Democrats pushed for an economic stimulus package under President Barack Obama after the financial collapse of 2008.

This is all very simple.

This could be Michigan/Ohio State. Auburn/Alabama. UCLA/USC. Yankees/Red Sox. Giants/Dodgers. Maple Leafs/Canadians. Argentina/Brazil.

Q: I have an Amazon Echo and I am really concerned that Amazon is listening all the time. Does the Echo have any privacy settings?

A: Ever since Echo hit the market, people have wondered how much the little glowing tower hears — and remembers. Is Echo silently eavesdropping on our conversations, even between “wake phrases”? So far, Echo hasn’t caused any mass hysteria, and most people are pretty content with the performance of their virtual assistant. But if you have any concerns at all, take action.

Q: I noticed that when I type certain words on Facebook, things happen, like confetti on the screen for “congratulations.” What other words or phrases do these things?

A: Some people find this confetti cheesy, but I enjoy scrolling down my feed, especially during special occasions, and watching explosions of color across my screen. There are actually several different words that will trigger cute animations. Technically, these are called “Easter eggs,” little surprises hidden in the digital fabric of your wall.

Saving HEIF photos

Q: Now that HEIF has replaced JPEG, should I convert my photos to the new format?

A: The HEIF photo format saves space, improves the quality of your images and can preserve multiple images (and even audio) in a single file. While the JPEG has been a dependable workhorse for nearly 30 years, HEIF will probably become the standard file format in the very near future. So does this mean you should dig through your entire image collection, converting thousands of JPEGs into HEIF? The short answer is “no,” because your JPEGs will still work just fine. But if you love your pictures, I have some advice on how to proceed from here. Click here to learn all about HEIF photos.

Netflix offline

Q: I have to take a long plane ride home for the holidays. Is there a way to watch Netflix in the air?

A: Last year, Netflix made a surprising decision: The streaming-video giant decided to let customers download movies. Not all movies are available for download, but you can use the service’s app to install content directly on your computer, tablet or phone. Why was this surprising? Netflix execs had publicly sworn they would never make downloads possible. But with growing competition from Amazon Prime, Vudu, and even Vimeo, Netflix had to catch up with the times. The real winner is you, because you no longer have to hunt for a Wi-Fi signal or set up a personal hotspot to enjoy a movie on the go. Click here to learn how to watch free movies while traveling.

Vet your babysitter

Q: I have a new sitter watching the kids. I want to put a cam in the room. Can I hear what’s being said in the room or is it just video?

A: Now and again, people ask about “nanny cams,” thinking their purpose is to spy on babysitters. The term is a little confusing, so let me clarify: “Nanny cam” is designed to act as a nanny, making sure your kids are safe and behaving themselves. I would always suggest being transparent with your sitter, explaining that your house has surveillance cameras and you like to check in from time to time. You can watch and listen in, even hold a conversation if you want. Click here for the best nanny cams for watching kids.

Prior to the marriage, Markle and Engelson dated for six years while they were both pursuing their high-profile careers.
Markle and Engelson have no children together and she’s reportedly not involved with the TV series in any capacity.
""Suits"" may have been reportedly to blame for Markle’s first marriage's demise, but it may have also led to her recent engagement to Prince Harry.
Last month, gossip magazines reported Prince Harry visited Markle on the sets of “Suits” in Toronto.","Meghan Markle is on her way to becoming the future bride of Britain’s Prince Harry, but before becoming the royal’s main squeeze, the American actress was married to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson.

Kensington Palace announced Monday the 36-year-old “Suits” star is engaged to the 33-year-old son of the late Princess Diana. The two are set to marry in the spring of 2018.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MEGHAN MARKLE

Here’s what you need to know about the man who was once married to the potential new royal princess:

Us Weekly previously reported Markle and the 41-year-old tied the knot on Sept. 10, 2011 at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica where they had a casual wedding in front of 102 guests. It was the same year the USA Network starlet took on the role of Rachel Zane in the series “Suits.”

Vogue reported Markle would later return to the tropical getaway in March 2017 with Prince Harry to celebrate the wedding of a mutual friend.

Prior to the marriage, Markle and Engelson dated for six years while they were both pursuing their high-profile careers.

However, the marriage wouldn’t last.

In September 2013, a source confirmed to Us Weekly the couple “quietly separated.” While it’s not exactly clear why the pair parted ways, they cited “irreconcilable differences.” One insider hinted to Woman’s Day at the time that Markle’s hectic schedule to film “Suits” in Toronto while her husband resided in Los Angeles made married life difficult for the two.

Engelson has remained tight-lipped about his marriage to Markle, despite alleged rumors of publishers offering a major paycheck for a tell-all — that is until this year.

Deadline.com reported in September Engelson was working on an untitled project about a lead character sharing custody with the British royal family after his ex-wife marries a prince. While the comedy may have been inspired by real-life events, the Hollywood news site added the premise is a work of fiction.

Markle and Engelson have no children together and she’s reportedly not involved with the TV series in any capacity. However, it was noted the project originated from a conversation Engelson shared with fellow producer Dan Farah about what life would have been like if the former lovers did have kids.

Engelson has kept busy in Hollywood. FX Networks reported that his role as a producer took off with the 2007 film “License to Wed,” starring Robin Williams, John Kransinski and Mandy Moore. Then in 2009, he produced “All About Steve” with Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper. In 2010, he worked on the 9/11-themed drama “Remember Me” with Robert Pattinson, of “Twilight” fame.

Engelson is currently producing “Snowfall,” a series that explores the early days of the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles during the 1980s. He’s also executive producing the upcoming “Heathers” remake for television.

The agent has been identified as Peter Strzok, one of the agency’s most experienced and trusted counterintelligence investigators, said the New York Times, which first reported the dismissal.

The allegations came to light after the Justice Department’s inspector general started examining Strzok's messages.

“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel’s Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, confirmed to Fox News.

Strzok also worked on the FBI investigation last year into whether then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information through her use of private email servers while secretary of State.

During this investigation, Strzok was allegedly involved in an extra-marital affair with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, according to The Washington Post.

“Lisa Page completed her brief detail and had returned to the FBI weeks before our office was aware of the allegations,” Carr also said in his statement, though it was not immediately clear to which allegations he was referring.

Mueller was appointed in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether President Trump or any of his associates colluded with Russian during the 2016 White House race.

Mueller took the assignment after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the probe because of campaign involvement, per DOJ regulations.

Strzok was reportedly reassigned this past summer from the Mueller investigation to the FBI’s human resources department, according to The Times.

Perry sought to purchase an 8-acre property for $14.5 million in a central Los Angeles neighborhood in 2015.

The property included a Roman-villa style building, with an attached convent that had closed in 2011, Variety reported.

Businesswoman Dana Hollister allegedly interfered with the transaction by attempting to preemptively purchase the house from two nuns who had, until recently, lived in the convent for 40 years, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Hollister has been buying up property in neighboring Silver Lake since the 1990s, the Los Angeles Times reported. She is now the owner of several restaurants, including Cliff’s Edge and the Brite Spot.

A jury found Hollister guilty of interference. She was ordered to pay a total of $3.47 million to the archdiocese and $1.57 million to Perry as compensation for the subsequent court fees.

The nuns who once lived on the convent, reportedly opposed selling to Perry, and tried instead to sell to Hollister. But a judge nullified the sale earlier this year and ruled that the archdiocese had the right to sell the property, not the nuns, Variety reported.

Hollister’s lawyer, Michael Geibelson, said in court that Hollister didn’t “intend harm,” but declined to comment on the matter further, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Geibelson plans to appeal the decision before the state Court of Appeal, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Focus on the things that unite you and your family, not what divides you.","Thanksgiving should be a time to reconnect with our families and traditions. But this year may be more difficult than usual. After a politically fraught year, you and all the members of your extended family might not – and this is likely an understatement – be seeing eye-to-eye politically.

There’s a practical answer to this problem, and it’s one that I’ve seen work over and over again during my life and much of my career observing and studying families. One pattern that repeatedly emerges is that healthy, high-functioning families focus on what unites them, as opposed to picking at what divides them.

There’s some good psychological underpinning for this approach: arguing over politics usually doesn’t do any good. As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman points out, the chance of you being able to change someone’s mind on a deeply held political view is close to zero.

Since political arguments are almost never productive, take my advice – this Thanksgiving, resist the temptation to engage in them. Even an offhand mention of a recent political event or of a particular leader could quickly spoil the whole dinner.

Let me be clear: I’m not saying families should never discuss politics. Our nation is currently grappling with all kinds of incredibly difficult issues, and it’s important that families develop the ability to discuss them calmly and thoughtfully.

Thanksgiving is not the time for political debates. It’s a time to emphasize all the things that unite you as a family, and to work on developing the kinds of bonds that hold a family together.

But Thanksgiving is not the time for political debates. It’s a time to emphasize all the things that unite you as a family, and to work on developing the kinds of bonds that hold a family together.

This is particularly important for family businesses. Seventy percent of family businesses don’t endure beyond one generation – and that’s often because they’ve failed to develop the kind of family culture of tolerance and acceptance that can sustain a business through the generations.

If the younger generation’s memories of holidays are solely of adults arguing over politics, they’re far more likely to grow up and continue that destructive pattern. Instead, have the family business leaders model good behavior, such as consideration, tact and simple kindness.

Encourage Family Traditions: They’re the Lifeblood of Identity

It's through traditions that we connect with our families and engage with our heritage. Traditions are our rituals, ceremonies and the activities that we reliably do as a family through the years and across the generations.

They're an anchor in the changing sea of our life experiences. We get older, we go to school, we get jobs, people drift in and out of our lives, but our family traditions can continue through all our life stages as they continuously reinforce ""What it means to be us.""

Traditions help create a shared sense of identity and belonging, and help establish continuity between the generations. Many families have specific Thanksgiving traditions, and eagerly anticipate the annual football game in the backyard, pumpkin pie, or time spent in prayer and thanks. In my family, we spend part of the day wrapping holiday presents for disaster victims.

Tell Your Family Stories

Here again, families can learn from Thanksgiving: Each year, we tell part of our country’s story – how a courageous group of men and women braved the frigid Atlantic to find the freedom to practice their faith. This annual retelling reminds us of all that we value as Americans: freedom, bravery, tolerance and helping our neighbors.

You can do the same as a family. Retell your story. Think about where you are, where you came from, and where you’re going. And if crafting that story seems too hard or complicated, start out with some simple questions. Does everyone know who they’re named for? Do you know what your parents’ first jobs were? Do you know where your aunts and uncles grew up?

Conversations like these often turn out to be incredibly rich and rewarding – so much so that you might want to record the details people recall so as to remember them. Whether it’s making a family coffee table book – what we do every year in my family – or hiring a videographer to film interviews, it’s a worthwhile investment in your family culture.

There’s no denying that Thanksgiving, and indeed the holidays in general, can be a challenging time for families. But by intentionally using it to develop and deepen strong family bonds, you can make the most of the most wonderful time of the year.

North Korea launched a missile early Wednesday morning, South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said. . . Wednesday’s missile was launched from Pyongan province and fired to the east, South Korea’s joint chiefs said, according to the Yonhap News Agency.

In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations at the end of last month, Joseph Yun, the State Department’s special representative for North Korea policy, said that if North Korea went 60 days without testing a missile or a nuclear weapon, it could be a sign that Pyongyang was open to dialogue.

Apparently they are not so open to dialogue after all. Indeed, the North Korean launch is a finger in the eye to China, which had just sent a high level envoy to Pyongyang at President Trump’s request. Trump tweeted hopefully about the Chinese visit: “China is sending an Envoy and Delegation to North Korea – A big move, we’ll see what happens!” What happened was a big middle finger to Beijing and Washington from “Little Rocket Man.”

Here is how Trump should respond: Take out the test site from which the North Koreans launched the missile toward Japan — just like he struck the military base in Syria from which the Assad regime had launched a chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.",Thiessen: Trump Should Take Out the Site Where North Korea Just Launched a Missile,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/29/thiessen-trump-should-take-out-site-where-north-korea-just-launched-missile

More hilarity ensued in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s game of thrones Tuesday when the acting acting director Leandra English got her head handed to her by a federal judge.

After doing photo-ops with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Ms. English continued pretending to be the CFPB acting director. But by the day’s close, the drama queen was formally deposed. Federal judge Timothy Kelly denied Ms. English’s petition for a temporary restraining order to block Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney from serving as the real acting director. President Trump appointed Mr. Mulvaney on Friday under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act after Richard Cordray resigned and anointed Ms. English.

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel affirmed the President’s authority to appoint Mr. Mulvaney. And even CFPB general counsel Mary McLeod affirmed this legal interpretation in a memo to staff on Saturday.",Wall Street Journal: A Drama Queen Loses Her Head,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/29/wall-street-journal-drama-queen-loses-her-head#commenting

“I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!” the president tweeted early Sunday morning.

His tweet came after he also said on Twitter he fired Flynn because “he lied to the Vice President and the FBI” and compared the case to Hillary Clinton’s email scandal.

Comey, in his opening statement for the testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, said that Trump had asked him to back off the Flynn investigation during an Oval Office meeting on Feb 14. Flynn had already been fired from his position in the administration over revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about his communications with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.

“When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn,'"" Comey wrote in his opening statement.

Comey wrote Trump, then said: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.""

The former FBI director said he did not tell Trump he would stop the probe.

Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his talks with Kislyak on Trump’s behalf. He was charged with one count of “willfully and knowingly” making false statements to the FBI.

Trump, speaking to reporters on Saturday, reiterated there was “absolutely no collusion” with the Russians.

In October, Rapp told Buzzfeed News that in 1986 when he was 14-years-old, Spacey, a Broadway actor at the time, invited him to his apartment for a party. Later in the evening, Spacey, then 26, allegedly “picked Rapp up, placed him on his bed, and climbed on top of him, making a sexual advance,” the report stated.

Following the report, at least 24 other men have come forward to accuse Spacey of sexual misconduct or assault. London police were reportedly investigating two sexual assaults. The Oscar winner was fired from Netflix's “House of Cards” and replaced in Ridley Scott’s completed film “All the Money in the World.”

Rapp said he has received praise for coming forward but he also got backlash as well.

“Thank you to all of you who have been expressing support and solidarity. Your kindness is felt and much appreciated. And I have experienced such support far more than I have experienced negativity,” Rapp tweeted earlier this week.

Following his tweet, Rapp started posting angry responses he received on Instagram from Spacey’s fans.

“Here are some comments on Instagram,” Rapp tweeted. “I’ve decided I want to share some of them because people need to be outed for their harassment.”

Many of the responses blamed Rapp for ending “House of Cards,” ruining Spacey’s career and accused the actor of wanting attention.

“Hey you f---ing a—hole! Thanks for getting my favorite show canceled,” one message read.

“So you were 14 and at a adult party? So you were innocently chilling in a room watching tv while a party was happening? Seriously? You are a opportunist. You are not a victim,” another message read.

The FXE maintains the lines of the Fast Eddy, though there are subtle differences like the new rear wing and more aggressive front fascia. The FXE also ditches the Corvette-style flags logo found on the Fast Eddy.

Both the central tub and body of the FXE are made from carbon fiber, helping to maintain a curb weight of 3450 pounds. That might seem heavy for a carbon fiber exotic, but it’s partially due to the car featuring a hybrid system with a 10-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery.

The powertrain consists of a 6.2-liter V-8 and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission combo powering the rear axle and a pair of electric motors powering the front axle, thus making the FXE an all-wheel-drive car. The combined output is 1150 horsepower and 1,316 pound-feet of torque, which is enough for 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.1 seconds and a top speed of 220 mph.

Should demand be sufficient, Aria says a small run of FXEs could be built. We’re talking around 400 cars. The company estimates it will take at least another year before the first prototypes could hit the road.

There’s no word on pricing, but Aria President and CEO Clive Hawkins said the car would be “competitive with other supercars in this performance category.”

Aria, which is based in Irvine, California, provides design, engineering and manufacturing services for numerous firms, including automakers such as Honda, Kia, Mazda and Tesla. Just some of the dozens of concepts the company has built over the years include the Kia GT4 Stinger, Lincoln C and Mazda Furai.

FOX NEWS - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un ordered his engineers on Tuesday to launch the country’s new intercontinental ballistic missile with ""courage"" a day ahead of the flight test where it demonstrated its reach deep into the U.S. mainland.

State television on Wednesday broadcast a photo of Kim's signed order where he wrote: ""Test launch is approved. Taking place at the daybreak of Nov. 29! Fire with courage for the party and country!""

North Korea’s state television said that the nuclear-capable intercontinental-ballistic missile that was launched earlier is “significantly more” powerful than the previous weapon and puts the entire United States in its crosshairs.

The report called the weapon a Hwasong 15. The launch was detected after it was fired early Wednesday morning from a site near Pyongyang.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, which first reported the launch, said the missile launch happened around 3 a.m. local time in North Korea. South Korea fired pinpoint missiles into nearby waters to make sure North Korea understands it can be ""taken under fire"" by the South, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said.

The South Korean military said that the missile was fired from an area near Pyongyang. It reached a height of 2,796 miles and traveled 596 miles, demonstrating the potential to reach a range of 8,100 miles. David Wright, a U.S. physicist who has studied North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, said that this would put any part of the U.S. comfortably within reach of a North Korean missile strike.

One factor that could significantly affect the missile’s range is the payload. If, as expected, it carried a light mock warhead, then its effective range would have been shorter, analyst said.

As he lay in his hospital bed, shaken and frightened, he knew he had a choice to make.

""I put it in my head that I'd rather be a suspect than a victim,"" he said.

Ten years later, Alston faced another grim decision. He was dealing crack and hooked on prescription pills. He'd squeezed triggers, and seen friends and family members lose their lives to gunshots. After his last conviction, for accessory to murder, he knew was on the path to die in jail or die in the streets. This time, he rejected both.

Now Alston is a community outreach coordinator for U-TURNS, a project that tries to give Baltimore teenagers and young adults an alternative to the streets. They can find a safe space, food, job training, holistic health practices such as yoga and acupuncture, mental health services and — most important — mentorship.

The initiative's been in operation less than a year and couldn't come at a more pressing time. As of Dec. 3, Baltimore has seen 321 homicides this year, surpassing the 2016 total of 318. At least ninety-eight victims were no older than 25. Gun Violence Archive data show that from January 2014 to June 2016, roughly 7.2 teenagers of every 10,000 were shot. The figure, based on an analysis of news articles and police data, is likely an undercount.

This year, Police Commissioner Kevin Davis announced that he'd dedicate additional officers to street patrol. Two years ago, Davis launched a multiagency initiative called the ""war room"" to try and map the web of relationships among victims and perpetrators.

Still, the violence continues.

Alston and Kelvin Parker, 34, are both former drug dealers — and both victims and perpetrators of gun violence as teens. Now, in the early afternoons, they head to the same West Baltimore street corners where they used to deal. They try to persuade the corner boys to leave their posts. For about three hours daily, they walk through the Gilmor Homes projects and past blocks of vacant rowhouses in Sandtown, the neighborhood where the 2015 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray prompted protests and rioting. They wear black jackets with ""Outreach"" emblazoned in white on the back.

Building trust in a community where it's in short supply is one of their main goals.

One 17-year-old who started dealing at 14 comes to U-TURNS almost daily. Dealing was his only option, he said, after losing his mother at 3.

""The only way I knew that I could be somebody or have money in my pockets or accomplish anything was by turning over to the drug life,"" he said.

At 15, he was stabbed in the stomach. When he recovered, he decided he needed a change.

Now he's in therapy and helps care for children at Kids Safe Zone, an afterschool center that houses U-TURNS.

""I've learned that not everything revolves around violence, that not everything revolves around you,"" he said.

Alston and Parker, he said, are ""my role models. They've been through what I've been through.""

Parker grew up in Sandtown with his grandmother and a dozen others in a two-bedroom apartment. At 7, a gun was pulled on him for the first time, and he saw two men beat another unconscious with a 2-by-4. With his father in jail and mother too busy to raise him, Parker looked up to an older cousin, a notorious dealer.

""Guns on the table, guns in the cabinet, guns in the bathroom — that was my normal,"" he said. ""Coming up in a place where no one else values life, where no one else really cares, it's hard not to become what you're around.""

By 12, he'd started selling drugs. The lifestyle had a price — jail time.

""I didn't see a whole year on the street until I was 21,"" he said.

Alston also grew up fast. Born in 1991, at the height of the crack epidemic, his mother was addicted, leaving him and his sister to fend for themselves.

""I didn't have little army men,"" he said. ""I had colored vials.""

Alston said he spent most of his childhood bouncing from one house to another. Although he didn't start selling drugs until after he was shot, he admired neighborhood dealers for their clothes and cars, and ability to provide.

Alston fired his first gun at 14, in retaliation for a punch in the jaw so forceful it made his ear ring.

Parker had never fired a gun before he was struck. After he was shot, he knew he'd have to.

""Retaliation was a must,"" he said. ""It made me feel like a man, or what I thought a man was.""

Parker said he didn't realize until he started training as an outreach worker how much of what he endured as a child influenced him. He only recently came to understand trauma, he said, and is working to move past his own.

In group therapy sessions, Alston and Parker use an approach to processing trauma that focuses on safety, emotions, loss and the future. One afternoon, they gathered a half-dozen teens, all boys but one, and screened a ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" clip in which Will Smith's character discusses growing up without a father. Alston and Parker asked the teens to share an experience; almost all said they came from broken homes, with drugs and violence commonplace.

At another session, Alston led a discussion with a dozen teens about fear and danger, and explained how trauma can manifest in the body and mind.

Keeshanna Mobley, 17, bounced her baby nephew on her knee. She'd been coming to U-TURNS for a few months, since an arrest for fighting. She's on probation, and feels safer now that she spends time at the center instead of the streets, she said.

""There was a lot of stuff I was getting into before this, trouble, getting locked up, getting myself into the wrong situation at the wrong time,"" she said. ""Since I joined U-TURNS, it's been a lot less, because I'm here.""

Lauer, the former “Today” co-anchor, was fired from the network last week after an NBC employee told executives of his alleged sexual misconduct.

Lauer allegedly “gave a colleague a sex toy” and “had a button under his desk” that locked his door when he wanted privacy to “initiate inappropriate contact” with female employees, Variety reported.

Meanwhile, Lauer’s neighbors in New York City say that whenever they see him, he is never with his wife, the paper reported.

Lauer, who divorced his first wife, was on the cusp of split from Roque after she reportedly learned of an affair he allegedly had with an NBC colleague in 2006, according to the paper. However, the divorce was called off just three weeks after the initial filing.

Lauer reportedly offered $5 million to Roque in order to save the marriage, according to Page Six.

Since President Donald Trump took office, he has been consistently strategic in working to dismantle the radical, leftwing legacy of his predecessor.

While the mainstream media has fixated on exaggerated day-to-day mini-controversies, the Trump Administration has methodically eliminated job-killing Obama-era regulations, filled judicial vacancies with solid conservatives at an astonishing pace, and accomplished real breakthroughs in trade relations with China and the Middle East.

Now, the President is going after another Obama-era creation: the dangerously unaccountable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Long time readers of this newsletter know that I have opposed the CFPB on constitutional and economic grounds for years. I’ve written about the agency’s mafia-like tactics as well as the threat its behavior poses to the rule of law. I have even testified before Congress about the danger this agency poses.

This CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and was largely designed by radical Senator Elizabeth Warren when she was an Obama advisor. Since the beginning, it has been used as a political weapon by the far Left as a way to intimidate businesses that the Left opposes ideologically.

The CFPB consistently oversteps its bounds. It is prohibited from regulating car deals, yet it does so anyway. It is prohibited from collecting personal data from consumers, yet it does so at a scale that rivals the NSA’s most controversial data gathering operations.

Further, the CFPB draws its funding from the Federal Reserve’s operating expenses rather than annual appropriations – making it unaccountable to Congress. The writers of Dodd-Frank also specified that the director could only be removed by the president – and only under specific circumstances. This undermines both congressional and executive powers.

Some way to market to President Trump’s 63 million supporters!","The NFL, beleaguered by player protests during playing of the national anthem that have angered many fans and lowered TV ratings for its games, has doubled down on liberal politics.

As you’ve probably heard by now, the league proposed last week to join players in donating nearly $100 million to what ESPN called “causes important to African-American communities.”

But in reality, the proposal is nothing more than a political stunt designed to score brownie points with the mainstream media – from ESPN and Sports Illustrated, to the New York Times.

The NFL wants to partner with the Players Coalition, which represents players “protesting social injustices and racism,” along with a pair of liberal nonprofits – the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and Dream Corps.

According to ESPN: “The NFL hopes this effort will effectively end the peaceful-yet-controversial movement that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started when he refused to stand for the national anthem last season.”

Don’t be fooled. The NFL’s donation isn’t about “social causes” or “racial equality.” It’s about America’s favorite football league caving to left-wing activists.

Both the UNCF and Dream Corps, which have been critical of President Trump, would each receive $25 million under the NFL proposal. The Players Coalition would get the rest of the money to make charitable contributions to other organizations.

As soon as the news broke, ESPN praised the “donation to social justice organizations” in the enduring “push for racial equality.” Sports Illustrated claimed the plan would “address social justice issues” that will “help in African-American communities.” The New York Times seized on the proposal, saying it will “aid social causes.”

Don’t be fooled. The NFL’s donation isn’t about “social causes” or “racial equality.” It’s about America’s favorite football league caving to left-wing activists.

Just follow the money, which would ironically come from the NFL owners who many liberals have vilified as “racist” for denying Kaepernick a job he doesn’t deserve. Kaepernick has not been hired by another team this season, after leaving the 49ers.

The UNCF has criticized President Trump’s education budget in recent months. The Dream Corps is a nonprofit advocacy group founded by CNN commentator Van Jones, who called President Trump’s election victory a “whitelash.”

Dream Corps is essentially a promotional vehicle for Jones, featuring his new book and other racially charged political commentary. One of the group’s top issues is an “inclusive green economy” to “lift people out of poverty” – because there’s nothing low-income Americans need more, of course, than stricter environmental regulations.



Moreover, Dream Corps sponsored the anti-Trump “We Rise Tour” and provides catchy posters for its ongoing “Anti-Fascist War.” One reads: “Real Men Rep the F-Word #Feminist.” Another proclaims: “No Ban. No Wall. Sanctuary for All.”



You get the picture. Instead of bringing Americans together around a national pastime, the NFL is standing with multimillionaire anthem kneelers and funding the anti-Trump resistance movement. Some way to market to President Trump’s 63 million supporters!



The NFL would be better off appeasing its loyal fans than liberal activists. All three of the league’s Thanksgiving games saw double-digit drops in viewership from the previous year. Meanwhile, NFL merchandise sales have fallen by 20 percent in recent years. People are changing the channel and their shopping habits.



The same goes for ESPN, which has inundated Americans with pro-Kaepernick and anti-Trump coverage for months. The network recently laid off 150 more employees, bringing the total number of 2017 layoffs to 250 workers.



Memo to the sports industry: Stick to sports – or face extinction.

His T-shirt was ripped. He was hungry. He was not well-cared for. He had never been to school. We don’t know exactly why his legs have never worked, but our best guess is that he had some sort of traumatic injury at birth.

I am sharing Chinyelo’s remarkable story now because Sunday is International Day of Persons with Disabilities, created by the United Nations in 1992. It is a day to think about people who don’t get the attention they deserve.

In the culture in Thomazeau, Haiti, Chinyelo is seen as cursed. Because of this he is viewed as worthless. People treat him and others with disabilities poorly, because they believe he doesn’t matter.

One of my other disabled friends in Haiti has been raped repeatedly because it is believed to bring good luck to rape a disabled person before buying a lottery ticket or making a business venture.

When the faith-based organization where I work – LiveBeyond – began humanitarian work in Haiti, we saw the abysmal circumstances of so many disabled people and we couldn’t stand by and do nothing. Especially not with our legacy.

LiveBeyond’s co-founder, Laurie Stallings Vanderpool, had a younger brother – John Mark “Johnny” Stallings – who was born with Down syndrome. At the hospital, his parents – legendary football coach Gene Stallings and his wife, Ruth Ann – were told they should send him off to an asylum.

The Stallings were told that Johnny’s heart condition would not allow him to make it past his first year. These loving parents decided to disregard the doctor’s advice and took him home with the rest of their family.

Johnny Stallings brought light to the Stallings family for 46 years before he passed away in 2008. He was the absolute joy of his family. But his light spread even farther than his family. Coach Stallings took Johnny to football practices and games and became an advocate for those with special needs, particularly those at the RISE Program at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

Johnny made friends with everyone he met. Faulkner University named its football field after him. The University of Alabama named its equipment room in his honor. He accomplished so much in his lifetime – and his legacy lives on.

We started the Johnny’s Kids program at LiveBeyond to honor Johnny’s memory. We provide physical and occupational therapy, educational opportunities, Bible lessons, nutritional support, sports activities and friendship to the children in the program.

Soon we will break ground on Johnny’s House, a facility for the disabled in Haiti who don’t have a support system. It will be a safe place for them to live, work and learn free of danger.

Thankfully, we are not the only ones who noticed this issue. In Haiti. myLIFEspeaks offers special education classes for 22 children with disabilities and offers physical and occupational therapy to disabled adults and children. The organization also holds a Night to Shine in conjunction with the Tim Tebow Foundation.

Now when I think of Chinyelo, I think of an athletic boy who loves to learn, play and compete with his best friend Pierre Richard, who has a similar condition. I love watching them race wheelchairs, tone their muscles on obstacle courses and play soccer.

They both began attending school this year and are making astronomical progress. They have changed so much in the few years that I’ve known them. These two boys don’t let anything hold them back. We shouldn’t either.

Kim Jong Un tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in the early hours of Wednesday, and the data suggest it could hit all of the continental United States. If North Korea is allowed to perfect its warhead technology, it will be able to hold the U.S. hostage to nuclear ransom. The Trump Administration is right that the U.S. can’t live with this threat, so what more should it do to prevent it?

Leona Evans, who was seriously injured, wound up in the water after driving her Hyundai Santa Fe across four lanes of traffic and through a fence on Friday.

""When we arrived, there was just this red SUV floating, wasn’t sitting, floating on the water in the middle of this retention pond,” Hillsborough County deputy Benjamin Thompson told FOX 13 Tampa.

Thompson and deputy Trent Migues arrived on the scene as several people who had witnessed the crash were trying to pull Evans' car out of the water.

""They had actually gotten a rope,” Thompson said. “They were trying to attach the car, thinking they could pull it back while it was floating.”

The station reported that Thompson dove into the pond and swam out to Evans. He then used his baton to smash the window of the SUV to get inside.

""I hit that window in the corner, and I hit it, and I hit it, and I hit it, and I hit it with all my life, then after about the 6th time it finally shattered,” he said. “And I knew the water was going to come in at that point, but I didn't realize how fast, it was like a waterfall, that car began to sink.""

Migues told reporters that ""the scariest moment was when her screaming stopped, and the roofline started going underneath the water, and my partner here disappeared in the car with her.""

Eventually, Thompson cut his face, arms and hands on jagged pieces of glass as he pulled Evans out of the vehicle.

They were then helped out of the water by Migues and the Good Samaritans.

By Samuel Chamberlain | Fox News

The U.S. Senate voted just before 2 a.m. ET Saturday to pass a sweeping tax overhaul worth roughly $1.4 trillion, putting the Trump White House a big step closer to its first major legislative victory – and many Americans closer to a tax cut.

The vote was 51-49, with Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee the only member of the GOP to side with the Democrats in opposition.

Not long after the vote, President Donald Trump tweeted his reaction:

""We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America,"" the president wrote. ""Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate. Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!""

Upon arrival, however, the buyer learned that the product photography was, in fact, a little too accurate: The pillowcase arrived exactly as advertised, and literally featured a photo of small boy resting his head resting on the plush dinosaur.

Reddit user Adoringly shared a photo of the shopper’s mistake in the r/CrappyDesign forum, where it’s been described as both “hilarious“ and “true advertising.”

“Oh, this is golden,” wrote one Reddit commenter. “And also a little bit creepy.”

“What you see is what you get,” remarked another.

All jokes aside, this particular incident speaks to a larger problem with Amazon and counterfeit goods. In fact, the pillowcase that the user most likely expected (in the shape of a plush dinosaur) is made by a Seattle company called Milo & Gabby — a company that actually sued Amazon in 2013 for failing to prevent a third-party Chinese manufacturer from copying its designs and putting the wares alongside Milo & Gabby’s own on Amazon, reports GeekWire.

In 2015, a judge eventually ruled that Amazon wasn’t responsible for the infringement or misrepresenting its online wares, though he did say he was “troubled” by the impact his decision might have in future cases, especially since “we now live in a time where the law lags behind technology.” An appeals court upheld his ruling in 2017,” GeekWire added.

A U.S. official told Fox News Saturday the missile did not survive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere — a feat North Korea has been attempting to perfect.","North Korea lambasted the U.S. and South Korea on Sunday for bringing the countries to the “brink of a nuclear war” a day before the allies begin a joint military drill in a defiant show of force against Kim Jong Un less than a week after the regime launched an intercontinental ballistic missile.

North Korea’s state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, wrote in a commentary Sunday the upcoming military drill is an “all out provocation against” the rogue nation that “may lead to a nuclear war at any moment.”

“Such drill is a dangerous provocation as it is driving the tension on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war,” the commentary said. “The U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces are so foolish as to run amok with such stealth fighters.”

It added, “The stealth fighters, which the enemies boast so much of, will not escape the fate of a tiger moth.”

A spokesman for North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country — an organization focused on reunifying the North and the South — also said “insane President Trump is running wild” in a statement released by the state’s Korean Central News Agency.

“The situation clearly proves that the U.S. and the South Korean puppet war maniacs are just aggressors and provocateurs breaking peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region and that the DPRK was entirely just when it decided to invariably take the path of simultaneously developing the two fronts in order to bolster up its war deterrent in every way,” the spokesman said, according to KCNA.

U.S. and South Korea are expected to begin a five-day military drill, called Vigilant Ace, on Monday, less than a week after Kim ordered officials to launch the Hwasong-15 ICBM in the middle of the night that landed in the Sea of Japan. About 12,000 U.S. troops will join South Korean forces, along with 230 aircraft, will participate in the drill, according to Reuters. The drill, used to simulate wartime defenses, was scheduled before Wednesday’s missile launch.

A U.S. Air Force official also said F-22 stealth fighters and F-5 aircraft will partake.

Kim was pictured visiting a factory in North Korea that built the tires for a huge vehicle used to transport the Hwasong-15 ICBM, the state media reported on Saturday. Kim thanked workers for manufacturing the large-size tires for the 9-axle missile truck without relying on imported equipment and called for efforts to raise production to ""satisfy the daily-increasing needs in developing the country's economy and beefing up national defense capabilities,"" KCNA said in a statement.

NORTH KOREAN MISSILE BROKE UP ON RE-ENTRY, US OFFICIAL SAYS

Kim in September tasked the Amnokgang Tire Factory to make the tires for the ""great event in November,"" the agency reported.

North Koreans held a massive rally on Friday to celebrate the success of Wednesday’s missile test, putting on a firework display at Pyongyang. North Korea released photos of the Hwasong-15, confirming to experts the ICBM was a newly built missile and “significantly more” powerful than its predecessor, the Hwasong-14. Kim also boasted that the ICBM has the ability to reach the “entire U.S. mainland” with a nuclear warhead strapped to it.

South Korea's Defense Ministry said Friday that the ICBM was potentially capable of striking targets as far away as 8,100 miles, which would put Washington within reach. A U.S. official told Fox News Saturday the missile did not survive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere — a feat North Korea has been attempting to perfect.

Kim Jong Un tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in the early hours of Wednesday, and the data suggest it could hit all of the continental United States. If North Korea is allowed to perfect its warhead technology, it will be able to hold the U.S. hostage to nuclear ransom. The Trump Administration is right that the U.S. can’t live with this threat, so what more should it do to prevent it?

Conventional wisdom says that Pyongyang already faces extreme economic and diplomatic pressure. But in reality the United Nations and U.S. only began to impose broad sanctions last year, and even U.S. allies such as Singapore and Thailand have been slow to enforce them. China and Russia continue to support the Kim regime—China through oil exports and other commerce, and Russia through payments for North Korean slave labor.

Shutting down those lifelines should be a top priority. After the North’s intermediate-range missile launch in September, the U.S. circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council to do just that. But Russia and China resisted and the U.S. caved; Resolution 2375 only capped oil exports and labor contracts.

CHRIS WALLACE, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" HOST: You are looking live at Air Force One and the Ronald Reagan presidential library. That’s the flying White House that took our 40th president some 600,000 miles around the globe in pursuit of peace and democracy.

And hello again from Fox News today in Simi Valley, California. I’m Chris Wallace, and welcome to a special hour of ""Fox News Sunday"" from the Fifth Annual Reagan National Defense Forum.

Key players in national security including top administration officials, members of Congress, and military leaders came here to address the state of our national defense.

This hour, we will share highlights from the forum, including a conversation with Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz about the art of negotiating.

One of the Republican leaders in the Senate, John Barrasso, joins us to discuss Senate passage of the GOP tax plan and what comes next.

And we’ll ask President Trump's national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster, about Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe.

We begin there with correspondent Kevin Corke live at the White House with how the president’s inner circle is handling the Flynn news -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, a Twitter storm early Sunday with the president tweeting several tweets about the FBI, calling them inconsistent and unfair in the ongoing Russia probe. But the White House also found itself trying to save yet another self-inflicted Twitter wound, this time not over the substance of what the president had to say, but rather over the style and lack of nuance and social media, which is raising all sorts of serious questions.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE (voice-over): The president tweeted: I had to fire General Flynn because he had lied to the vice president and the FBI. He's pled guilty to those lies. It's a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful, there was nothing to hide.

But in Washington, that statement set off alarms with critics suggesting that the president's tweet means he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired him. There are reports that the president's personal lawyer John Dowd is the one who crafted that tweet and did so in a, quote, ""sloppy manner.""

The president adding this. I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn, just more fake news covering another Comey live.

All this as his former national security advisor faces time behind bars for lying to the feds, investigating possible collusion with the Russians in an effort to affect the 2016 election.

MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Yes, that's right, lock her up!

CORKE: Chance of lock him up and obvious twist on then now infamous ""lock her up"" chant at the RNC last year, a chant led by Flynn in which he suggested that Hillary Clinton should be locked up for her role in the private email server scandal that overshadowed the campaign.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: General Flynn continues to cooperate with investigators. He faces a sentencing hearing in February. The president says they’re not going to find any collusion, Chris, because frankly, there was none -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke reporting from the White House, Kevin, thanks for that.

Earlier I sat down with the president's national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: General McMaster, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""

LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Chris, thank you. It's a pleasure to be back with you.

WALLACE: Now that Gen. Flynn has pleaded guilty, and that he is said to be cooperating with the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, are you in contact with other countries to reassure them that President Trump is firmly in charge, and his presidency is not in trouble?

MCMASTER: No, I don't think our allies need any reassurance. In fact, what we're doing is continuing to work with them on all the key challenges we face today, from North Korea, to the defeat of ISIS across the Greater Middle East, the ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan. We're working with our Latin American partners very closely on the issue of Venezuela.

And so, we're -- we haven't missed a beat, really, and the topic doesn't even come up.

WALLACE: But, honestly, do you know what General Flynn may have to say about President Trump and other people in his campaign team, and their involvement with the Russians during the campaign?

MCMASTER: No, that's -- I mean, that's not our focus on the National Security Council, obviously. So, what we're focused on are, you know, the key issues that we have to confront today to protect the American people, advanced our prosperity.

The priorities that the president's given us to move as quickly as we can to resolve this crisis with North Korea, a regime that's threatening the world, and to do everything we can to, as we defeat ISIS in the greater Middle East, make sure conditions are set so that ISIS doesn't return.

And also, so that we address the problem of Iranian influence across the region, which is driving a lot of this humanitarian and political crisis in the Middle East.

WALLACE: On a personal level, though, what are your thoughts about Gen. Flynn, fellow soldier who served in the military for 33 years, pleading guilty to lying to the FBI?

MCMASTER: Well, Chris, I -- you know, my thoughts are on what we have to do for the country. I don't -- I don’t really have a lot of spare time to think about other topics, other than our greatest national security challenges.

WALLACE: Let me ask you about another personnel issue which bubbled up this week. White House officials are talking openly about a plan to replace Secretary of State Tillerson by January, the first anniversary of President Trump being sworn into office.

The president and Secretary Tillerson pushed back on that hard.

But can you flatly deny that there is any plan in place to replace General -- Secretary Tillerson over the next couple of months?

MCMASTER: Yes, I'm not aware of any plan at all. What I'm aware of is that the secretary of state is traveling today to advance and protect our interests, as is our secretary of defense.

I know that we met on some very important topics in the past week, and have brought some great options to the president to protect the American people, and advance our interests where those interests are at risk.

So, the national security team, again, is not missing a beat, and I think is doing what the president expects of us, and what the American people expect of us.

WALLACE: Do you think it's harmful, though, you saw the story -- it was all over the place, and frankly, the White House didn't damp it down very much. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the spokeswoman, said, we don't have any personnel announcement at this time.

Are you worried about the effect and the idea that you're going to have the nation's chief diplomat traveling to Europe this week with people wondering whether he's really in charge, and whether he still has the president's confidence?

MCMASTER: Well, it's harmful if we let it be harmful. You know, I think it was Aristotle who said: focus on what you can control, and you can get a lot done.

So, what Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, myself, the director of central intelligence, the director of national intelligence, what we're all working on is what we can hopefully control, which is how to -- how to resolve many of these threats to national security, and take advantage of opportunities to advance and protect our interests.

WALLACE: The president retweeted videos this week from a fringe anti-Muslim group called Britain First that purported to show Muslims, in some cases, inaccurately, Muslim immigrants committing acts of violence.

British Prime Minister May spoke out against the president, sending these tweets. Here's what she had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The fact that we work together does not mean that we're afraid to say that when we think the United States had got it wrong, and to be very clear with them. And I’m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: General, why did President Trump send out those videos?

MCMASTER: Well, President Trump is the best judge of why he did that. But I know it was his intention to highlight the importance of creating safe and secure environments for our citizens -- to make sure that we have the right laws in place, enforcement mechanisms in place, to ensure that, at this critical time, when ISIS is being defeated in the Middle East, that there is no return of terrorists and extremists who can pose a risk to the American people, or to our allies and partners.

WALLACE: But you know that, for instance, in the case of the Dutch video, it was not an immigrant that was involved. Britain First is a fringe, anti-Muslim group. The woman whose tweets that he sent out has been convicted of hate crimes.

Why is that useful for the president of the United States?

MCMASTER: Well, I mean, the key thing is, as you highlight the real risks that these terrorists pose to our citizens, that we make sure that we never buy into or reinforce the terrorist narrative -- you know, this false narrative that this is a war of religion.

I mean, this is really a conflict that involves --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But his tweets were all about anti-Muslim -- about Muslim violence, he was making it.

MCMASTER: Well, those who adhere -- those who adhere to this ideology are really irreligious criminals who use a perverted -- what the president has called, a wicked interpretation of religion in an effort to -- you know, to recruit young, impressionable people to their cause, to foment hatred, and use that hatred to perpetuate violence.

And so, what we have to do is break that cycle of ignorance, hatred, violence at all points, and we're defeating Daesh in its so-called caliphate, 95 --

WALLACE: ISIS.

MCMASTER: Or ISIS. Ninety-five percent of the territory that they have controlled has been taken back, and none of it has been regained by them.

But the other two things the president said we have to be able to do is cut off their financing, and to defeat their wicked ideology. And we're working with allies and partners across the world, and especially in Muslim-majority countries, to do -- to do this in really unprecedented ways.

WALLACE: I want to pick up on exactly that point, because it's been widely reported the president is going to declare this week that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel -- although, he's not going to move the embassy.

Between that and the anti-Muslim videos that he retweeted, aren't you almost giving up on the chance for a Mideast peace agreement, and the support that you have so carefully built up in the Arab world?

MCMASTER: No, the president's not giving up on the Mideast peace agreement at all.

I think what the president is doing is reflecting what has been, you know, a U.S. law -- you know, a waiver that's been -- that's been done, I think, you know, 46 or 47 times. And he's following through on a pledge he made during his election.

Now, I'm not sure what decision he'll make; we've given him options. There are options involving the move of an embassy at some point in the future, which I think, you know, could be used to gain momentum toward a -- toward a peace agreement, and a solution that works both for Israelis and for Palestinians.

WALLACE: I want to move in the time we have left to perhaps the biggest issue -- North Korea.

This week, North Korea launched what's now is its longest-range ICBM missile. Here is how President Trump reacted to that.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A missile was launched a little while ago from North Korea. I will only tell you that we will take care of it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But China continues to export oil to North Korea, Russia continues to hire North Korean workers. So, how is the president going to, quote, take care of it?

MCMASTER: Well, the president's going to take care of it by, if we have to, doing more ourselves. But what we want to do is convince others, it is in their interest to do more.

China, as you know, has taken some unprecedented actions. And what we're asking China to do is, not do us or anybody else a favor, but to act in China's interest.

There's a real grave danger to China, to Russia, to all nations, by -- you know, from a North Korea that's armed with nuclear weapons. And of course, you have that direct threat, but you also have the threat of -- the potential of Japan, South Korea, others, arming themselves, possibly even with nuclear weapons. That is not in China's interest; it's not in Russia's interest.

And so, what the president's saying is, we all need to take care of it. If necessary, the president and the United States will have to take care of it, because he has said he's not going to allow this murderous, rogue regime to threaten the United States with the -- with the most --

WALLACE: Let me pick me up now --

MCMASTER: -- destructive weapons on the planet.

WALLACE: -- because this is my final question.

You have talked about preventive war -- that, at some point, if we can't get a diplomatic solution -- and that's your phrase, preventive war. What's the threshold for that?

And, conversely, we lived -- and, here we are at the Reagan Library -- for half a century with a Soviet Union that had thousands of warheads pointed at us through the policy of mutual assured destruction. They strike us, we strike them.

Why can't we, basically, coexist under that unpleasant reality with North Korea?

MCMASTER: Well, Chris, I don't think you or anybody else is willing to bet the farm, or a U.S. city on the decision-making -- rational decision-making of Kim Jong Un.

And as you know, this is a regime that's never met a weapon that it hasn't proliferated. It's a regime who's said what it -- clearly what its intentions are.

Its intentions are to use that weapon for nuclear blackmail, and then, to, quote, you know, ""reunify"" the peninsula under the red banner.

So, he would use this to get -- extract payoffs, as the regime has done with their nuclear program in the past, and to drive the States and our allies away from this peninsula that he would then try to dominate. And if you want to know what life looks like under a North Korea regime, you just have to look north of the 38th parallel.

The other really grave concern is the concern that he would proliferate or sell off these weapons to others. And there's never been a weapons system that North Korea has developed that it hasn't sold to somebody else.

So, you're looking at a grave threat directly from North Korea, but then, you're also looking, again, at the possibility of Japan, South Korea -- I don't know, I mean, Taiwan -- who else is going to -- Vietnam. Who else is going to conclude that to protect their populations, they need to have a similar capability?

So, this would be the most destabilizing development, I think, in the post-World War II period, and it is something that places us at direct risk, but places the world at risk.

WALLACE: General McMaster, thank you, thanks for your time, and what a great weekend here at the Reagan Library.

MCMASTER: A wonderful weekend. Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Thank you, sir.

MCMASTER: Thanks so much.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Up next, in the wake of the guilty plea from Michael Flynn, where does the Russia investigation go from here? We will bring in our Sunday group to discuss the key question that still remains, did the Trump campaign collude with Russia in the 2016 election or not?

As ""Fox News Sunday"" continues from the Air Force One Pavilion at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion. There's been absolutely -- there's been absolutely no collusion, so we're very happy. And, frankly, last night was one of the big nights.

REPORTER: Are you going to stand by Michael Flynn, sir.

TRUMP: We’ll see what happens.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump reacting to the news about his former national security advisor Michael Flynn.

And it's time now for our Sunday group here at the Reagan library. GOP strategist Karl Rove, columnist for the Hill, Juan Williams, Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin, and former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.

Let me say to all folks, don't get too used to this as a backdrop, but it is pretty darn special.

Karl, as someone who has been through a special counsel investigation, what’s your read on the Flynn guilty plea? How worried should President Trump and his lawyers be right now?

KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, I don't know if President Trump should be worried, but somebody's got to be worried. We know very few things, we can surmise a lot. We know that Michael Flynn got a sweetheart deal. Here is a guy who had enormous exposure on his dealings with Russia Today, paid for a speech in Moscow, his contacts with, his activity on behalf of the Turkish government, but he ended up getting knocked on a lying line to the FBI, and a deal that gives him no more than six months in jail if that.

But what we can surmise from this is that he has cut a deal because he can shed, avoid serious charges and shed light on the actions and statements of others. There are two in particular that are to be concerned today. Jared Kushner, who on December 22nd, told Flynn to intervene with the Russians on behalf of the U.N. resolution, and KT McFarland who on December 29th asked him to intervene with the Russians on the sanctions issue.

Maybe Mueller has information from Flynn that contradicts testimony they've already given in their interviews with the FBI or others. We don't know, but obviously he sees Flynn as a key to the actions and statements of others, and whoever those others are have got to be worried.

WALLACE: Juan, I think we need to point out that in the Flynn court documents on Friday, there was no mention whatsoever about collusion with the Russians during the campaign, and isn't that, at least for now, still the bottom line that after almost a year and a half of investigation, there is still no hard evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with the Russians to interfere with the 2016 election?

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you don't lie unless you have something to hide. And, obviously, Michael Flynn has admitted now that he lied. So, we don't have a clear case of collusion, but as you just heard from Karl Rove, he made a deal, and so he had something more to offer. Robert Mueller is no full, he wouldn't be giving a sweetheart deal to Mike Flynn unless Michael Flynn was giving him something valuable that could take him up the tree, so to speak, in terms of bringing him closer to true authority in terms of the Trump campaign.

But remember that when you talk about Paul Manafort or Rick Gates, who have already been indicted, these people have been charged with conspiracy, not collusion specifically. And when we talk about --

WALLACE: But it had nothing to do with Russia.

WILLIAMS: No, conspiracy potentially that could say that there was a conspiracy to bring Russia into cooperation with the Trump campaign.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, no, no. But, look, the Manafort charges had altered it with his financial dealings and it nothing to do with interference in the campaign.

WILLIAMS: But the charge was potentially interference, foreign interference in U.S. campaign, that's a conspiracy charge. And I think that would lead you in a direction that would say this is something closer to collusion, if not explicit collusion.

WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, your thoughts about this and the whole issue of Flynn’s guilty plea? And Juan raises a good question -- why would he lie about something, talking during the transition to Russian officials, which arguably wasn’t even a crime?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN, R-UTAH: I don't know why he would lie.

But this is good news for team Trump, because if Mueller could have charged him with something more dramatic than the lowest possible charge they could get, they would have. No collusion, no treason, no nothing. And now, they take Mike Flynn, they take somebody very important to this investigation, and now, he goes to the court and admits that he's a liar.

He's not going to have any sort of credibility to be able to say this happened or that happened because he's an admitted liar at this point.

WALLACE: Do you by that?

WILLIAMS: No, I think it's part of a deal, Congressman. I think that’s why it was --

CHAFFETZ: If they wanted to charge them with something greater, they would have.

WILLIAMS: No, but they didn’t want to, that’s my point.

CHAFFETZ: And they didn’t get anything. They didn’t --

WILLIAMS: But they would -- if they -- if they are making a deal, they are using it as pressure. In fact, you notice no sentencing component because the judge and a special prosecutor, special counsel, want to be able to say to him, all right, along the way, are you cooperating or not?

WALLACE: All right. We’re going to have plenty of time to talk about this and we really don't know what we don't know. Let's talk about something we do know, and that is the Senate passed a big tax plan early Saturday morning, and not surprisingly, the reaction from the president and from the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was very different. Here they are.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Tremendous tax reform, but it was the biggest package in terms of tax cuts ever passed in our country.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Not a single member of this chamber has read the bill. It would be impossible, some of the pages were completely crossed off and text has been replaced by handwritten notes.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Jennifer, we’re going to talk to Senator Barrasso, who was involved when this in the next segment. But as you look at the bill, is the key what’s specifically in the bill or more of the fact that after the failure on Obamacare repeal and replace, that congressional Republicans are passing something?

JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it's absolutely true that they feel that they made this win before the end of the year and they want to pass this as a Christmas present, if you will, before they leave for the Christmas holiday. They're going to have to come back, and to show you how much time pressure they're feeling, Congress is coming back a day early. They're coming back on Monday.

They will start to try and reconcile the two bills, the Senate and the House bill. And from those Republicans that I have spoken to, it's going to be pretty easy to reconcile. Some slight differences, but when congressman explained for the mortgage deduction, the Senate bill gives you $1 million deduction, the House bill 500,000, they can split the difference.

But the president, a part of the quote that you didn't like him, the president threw a wrench at the last moment when he got on Marine One. He said that the corporate tax rate could be 22 percent. Well, that was not in either the Senate or the House bill.

WALLACE: Might I just suggest that I have saved that to ask Senator Barrasso in the next segment.

(CROSSTALK)

GRIFFIN: Preemptive. But you could lose the freedom caucus Mark Meadows --

WALLACE: No, because they want to see that down to 20 percent.

GRIFFIN: They want it down to 15 percent, but 20 percent was the bare minimum. So, the razor-thin margin that they pass it by in the Senate, they could lose that if they make --

WALLACE: Karl, we got about a minute left. According to the polls, this is not a popular bill at this point, which is surprising for a tax because it's generally seen as doing more for cutting the tax rates for corporations than it does for the middle class, for average Americans.

Given that, if they do pass this bill, whatever -- you know, talking about details, but if they pass this basic bill, how much will it help Republicans politically in the 2018 returns?

KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, first of all, I think it’s less because it's tilted towards a corporate tax cut than simply if you look at the questions the pollsters are asking, they ask -- do you approve of crumbs tax reform bill, and his -- the approvals for the bill mirror his personal approval rating of the high 30s. This all depends on what happens. And the Republicans are counting on two things. One is that in January, withholding will reduce people’s withholding and their paychecks will be bigger and then also that the corporate tax rate cut will cause greater economic growth next year and both of those things are important to Republicans keeping the House and Senate.

WALLACE: Thank you, panel, and I hope that you have enjoyed your visit here to the Reagan library as much as I have. And I suspect from the smiles on your face, you have.

Up next, now that the House and Senate Republicans have both passed tax bills, can they agree on a compromise to put on President Trump's desk? A top Senate leader joins us to discuss that in the effort to avoid a government shutdown as ""Fox News Sunday"" reports from the Reagan presidential library in California.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We’ll ask a Republican leader, John Barrasso, what will end up on the president’s desk, next on ""Fox News Sunday.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Ever the cowboy, an 11-foot bronze statue of Ronald Reagan on his favorite horse El Alamein here at his presidential library.

The Senate passed the Republican tax bill early Saturday morning along party lines, but there are some big differences between a House and Senate plan. On individual taxes, the House tax cuts are permanent, while they expire after 2025 in the Senate bill. On corporate taxes, the House cuts the top rate from 35 to 20 percent in 2018. The Senate waits until 2019.

Joining us now live from Washington, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, head of the Republican Policy Committee.

Senator, as we have just noted, there are several differences between the House and Senate plans that have to be reconciled before a bill can go to the president. I want to put up what may be perhaps the two biggest that are creating the sharpest differences. In the Senate plan, most tax cuts for individuals, as we said, expire in 2026. And the Senate plan does not repeal the estate tax. House conservatives say that both of those are unacceptable. So how is that going to get worked out?

SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, R-WYO., CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN POLICY COMMITTEE: Well, first, Chris, thanks for having me.

Let me take a step back to say a year ago the American people voted for fundamental change in this country, and tax reform is a very big part of it. People wanting to keep more of their hard-earned money. That's what you see in the bills that passed both the House and the Senate. Absolutely there are some changes that still need to be made in conference to work these things out.

The other thing that you haven't mentioned and the big differences are, the Republican bill in the Senate eliminates the mandate of Obamacare. It takes Obamacare from being a mandatory program to a voluntary program. And, yes, I like the idea of making the -- taking away the death tax entirely.

You know, the other thing that we're doing in terms of helping stimulate the economy, President Trump talks about energy dominance for America. And we allow more energy exploration in an area of Alaska that's been off-limits for a long time. I hope those are included.

WALLACE: So -- so, briefly -- so, briefly, I mean, there are some things that you're saying you like better in the Senate plan, some things you like better in the House plan. But you only passed it in the Senate with one vote to spare. So the question is, is this going to be a give-and-take where you'll take some of one and some of the other, or is the House basically going to have to swallow this Senate plan?

BARRASSO: Well, there's going to be a conference committee. Members from the House and the Senate will get together to look for the best solutions. But we're not that far apart. Fundamentally for the American public, we double, double, the standard deductions, double the child tax credits. We will lower the rates.

And in terms of investing in America and an America first economy, we lower tax rates for main street businesses all across the country, as well as corporations, to make us much more competitive internationally, so investments are made in America and not overseas.

WALLACE: Well, let's -- let's talk about one of those investments then. President Trump, as Jennifer Griffin suggested, may have thrown a slight monkey wrench into things on Saturday morning. He suggested that instead of cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, that he might accept cutting them to 22 percent. A lot of hardline conservatives in the House say that is not acceptable. They want it down to 20 percent. They wanted 15 percent. Is that idea of a 22 percent corporate tax rate, is that on the table now?

BARRASSO: We have 20 percent in both the House and the Senate. That's the number that I'd like to see.

President Trump came to our policy lunch on Tuesday. I thought did a wonderful job explaining how important this is because once we get tax reform done and he is ready and willing to sign the tax relief for the American people, the tax reductions and tax cuts that people are desperately looking for to get the economy growing even faster, he said then we can go into additional things, infrastructure, all the important things.

WALLACE: Sir -- sir, to answer --

BARRASSO: Uh-huh.

WALLACE: To answer my question, is 22 percent acceptable or not?

BARRASSO: Well, everybody's going to have to decide for themselves how they would vote. My preference is 20 percent. I think we have a very good bill out of the Senate. The House has some components. But I think this is a major step forward for the American public. We are going to get this to the president's desk for his signature before the end of the year.

WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you about a couple of -- of questions that people are raising about this bill. One of the president and Republican's key selling points was that these tax cuts would pay for themselves because they would spur so much economic growth. Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: In our models, we believe it would be $2.5 trillion of growth. And we're happy to go through the numbers. We're happy to give the details.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But even taking into account economic growth, what's called dynamic scoring, the non-partisan joint committee on taxation came out with its analysis of the Senate plan this week. They say that even after growth, it still is going to add a trillion dollars to the debt. Not pay for itself, add a trillion dollars.

BARRASSO: Well, two -- two things. One is, the good news is, that this group is -- tends to be wildly pessimistic has actually said that there will be economic growth as a result of the things that we're proposing with this tax relief bill.

WALLACE: But not enough, sir.

BARRASSO: They -- they are wildly pessimistic. Economist across the board believed that we have -- we will do much, much better.

Just take a look at the current economy. These are all based on 1.8 stagnant Obamacare numbers. We don't have to do much to get up to much higher numbers because the last -- the last two quarters we've had over 3 percent economic growth in this country and we've had 2 million new jobs already created since the day President Trump was elected, and a lot of that has to do with the reform of regulations. So when you do regulatory relief, as well as tax relief, I think we are going to have an accelerated growth of the economy --

WALLACE: All right, and --

BARRASSO: Way beyond what people are predicting.

WALLACE: Another big selling point has been that the corporate tax cut will result in benefits, jobs, higher wages for the middle class. Here's President Trump.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. It's time to give American workers the pay raise that they've been looking for, for many, many years.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But major companies, like Cisco, like Pfizer, like Coca-Cola all say that they will turn over most of their tax savings, not to workers, but to shareholders in the form of bigger dividends and stock buybacks. That directly contradicts what the president's saying.

BARRASSO: Well, when we take our tax rates, the corporate rates from one of the highest in the world to now one of the lower tax rates in the world, we have a global economy, money will come rushing into the United States to invest here. I expect to see incredible amounts of investment from around the world. We live in a global economy, even though the joint commission on taxation really doesn't look at it that way when they do their evaluation and assessments.

WALLACE: I want to turn to a different subject, and that is, as you well know, the government runs out of money on Friday. The working thought is that now that you'll pass a two week extension till the 22nd of December, just before Christmas, and try to work out issues then. Is that something that you'd accepted, a two week extension to try to work things out?

And, also, what about Democrats and some Republicans were are now saying that to get a deal, a long-term spending deal, that you have to have a DACA fixed to protect the so-called dreamers?

BARRASSO: Well, I -- I think we need to keep the government open. To me, that's what a mature, responsible governing group does. You're right, it does require bipartisan participation. I thought it was incredible childish for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to not go to that White House meeting that they were scheduled to go to with President Trump. I thought it was a responsible on their part because we need to work together to keep the government open.

I'd like to move that date into either January or February. We need to fund the government and do it confidently.

WALLACE: And I got less than a minute left for this question, sir. On DACA, as I -- we said, some members of both parties are demanding a DACA fix as part of a long-term spending bill. This week we had the shocking verdict in the Steinle case where the illegal immigrant who had been deported and returned several times was acquitted on charges of murder. I know he was not a dreamer, but does that, just an emotional sense, make it harder to arrive at a DACA fix?

BARRASSO: Well, you know, the Democrats have threatened to shut down the government over dealing with illegal immigrants. People that are in the country illegally. I think that's the wrong way to go, but we've had Democrats speak to that effect. And I think that that recent result in that case and that -- that verdict points to the impact of that -- that illegal immigration has had in our country to a detrimental effect.

WALLACE: Senator Barrasso, thank you. Thanks for your time.

BARRASSO: Thank you.

WALLACE: And we'll track all the developments in Congress this week.

BARRASSO: Thanks for having me.

WALLACE: Up next, the U.S. faces growing threats from North Korea, Iran and Russia. We'll ask two national security experts about the president's foreign policy when we come back from the Reagan Presidential Library.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALI., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: We stand in the library of a man who taught us best to be prepared so you never have to use it, to be stronger so no one ever would challenge you that (ph).

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: A look outside the Reagan Presidential Library here in Simi Valley, California.

President Reagan's mantra was peace through strength as he dealt with the Soviet Union and other foreign threats. Well, this weekend at the Defense Form here, top officials and foreign policy experts discussed what's the best strategy for these times. Earlier, I sat down with Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and former vice chief of the Army, and Michelle Flournoy, another former undersecretary of defense for President Obama.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Gen. Keane, big picture -- how do you think President Trump is doing in national security and foreign policy?

GEN. JACK KEANE, FORMER VICE CHIEF OF STAFF, U.S. ARMY/RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL: Yes, I give him pretty good marks. I think it first begins with the National Security team he's picked. And, by and large, they know what they're doing. They have some background, some experience. Most of them have been in very stressful positions before. So, that's good.

In terms of what he's doing, I think what he's really trying to do is return America to a leadership role on a world stage once again, as the indispensable nation in the world. I think they believe that the United States, by and large, disengaged too much in our -- we've had problems with our allies and we've also had confrontations with our adversaries to a point where I think the risk has gone up rather considerable.

So that is what these 10 minutes (ph) have been about for me, reassuring allies, and willing to confront adversaries, and making certain that these alliances we have and these partnerships are sound, that the United States is truly a strategic partner.

WALLACE: Michele, how do you grade the president in these areas? I have a feeling, slightly differently.

MICHELE FLOURNOY, FORMER UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY/CENTER FOR A NEW AMERICAN SECURITY, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: It is a little differently. I -- I would agree with General Keane, that he -- the president has appointed a very strong National Security team, but I am concerned about some of his early actions.

He's withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accord, making the United States the only country that hasn't signed the accord. He is pulling out of the Iran deal, which was keeping a very nefarious actor from actively pursuing nuclear weapons, and, again, isolating the United States when all of the other parties to the deal are sticking with it, and so forth.

And then his own lack of discipline on his messaging. When he went to the NATO Summit, he was clearly very reluctant to commit the United States to the defense of Europe. When he tweets random thoughts -- sometimes, insulting thoughts for other leaders -- and creates a sense of crisis and unpredictability.

So my biggest fear right now is that allies are wondering whether they can rely on the United States. Is the United States still a predictable ally and leader?

WALLACE: I want to talk in a way that we haven't -- not about specific issues, but about, sort of, bigger areas. I -- the president just came back from his recent trip to Asia, and I was struck by his appearance at the economic summit in Vietnam, where he swore off big international trade deals, and Chinese President Xi embraced them. Here they both are.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful endorsement practically impossible.

XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator): Over the last few decades, economic globalization has contributed significantly to global growth. Indeed it has become an irreversible historical trend.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Michele, is President Trump creating a power vacuum in Asia that the Chinese are rushing to fill?

FLOURNOY: I think that is the danger. When the United States pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, which is a high standards trade deal that greatly advantaged U.S. economic interests, that left a vacuum, and it left our allies and partners high and dry.

China's very happily stepping into that vacuum and trying to get a trade agreement in place that advantages China and plays by its rules. So I am worried about that.

WALLACE: Let me turn to another area of the world, General Keane, which is your particular area of expertise, the Middle East. You now have Russia and Turkey and Iran working on a peace deal that would keep President Assad of Syria in place, and the U.S., it seems, somewhat on the sidelines. In effect, is Vladimir Putin winning in the Middle East?

KEANE: Yes, absolutely, at the expense of the United States. There's no doubt about it.

I don't -- I don't believe we actually have a real strategy to counter the Iranian's aggression in Syria. The Iranians want to build a land bridge from Iran through Iraq, through Syria, challenge Jordan, challenge Israel from Syria, all the way to Lebanon. And they're well on their way to doing that, Chris.

And our focus has been exclusively on ISIS. And the Iranians are moving east into Syria. The Russians are a part of that. Putin came into Syria by that military intervention. Hasn't done anything like that in 35 years.

And it's a huge win -- win for him, you know, politically, geopolitically. He stood up behind an ally when the United States, I think, was not standing up behind our allies. He's doing arms deals with every Sunni country in the region. He wants to build nuclear power plants for most of the countries in the region. He's trying to replace the United States as the most influential out of region country in there in the Middle East, a thing that we haven't enjoyed since the 1970s.

And I don't see a strategy from the administration that's going to counter the aggressiveness of the Iranians in terms of what they're doing. The words are there, but I don't see any execution, and also counter Putin's dramatically and accelerating influence in the Middle East.

WALLACE: Michele, do you agree with that, that we are creating a vacuum in the Middle East, and Iran and Russia are filling it? And if so, why would we do that?

FLOURNOY: Well, I -- I think there is a lot of hesitation about furthering military involvement in the Middle East given what's happened in the last 15 years. But I do agree that Iran and Russia have both taken advantage of that situation, and we don't have the same leverage that we used to have there.

I do think it's very important to reengage with our most important allies and partners, Israel, the Gulf States, and others, and try to come up with the kind of strategy that the general's talking about.

But this is not just a matter of, you know, being strong militarily. We also need a strong diplomatic arm. And right now I'm very worried about the -- the sort of decimation of the State Department and the departure of many, many senior diplomats, and the failure to bring in whole classes of new Foreign Service officers. So ware are -- we're tying one arm behind our -- you know, one arm behind our backs.

WALLACE: We got about a minute left, and I want you to equally share it.

When you'd ask the White House, they say the Trump doctrine is ""America first."" What are we getting in return for that? General?

KEANE: I don't believe it is ""America first."" I -- it's never been ""America first"" with the implication that it's ""America alone.""

What -- what they have done, in the -- in the visit to the far east, a visit to the Middle East, and the visit to Europe is making certain that those alliances are there, that the United States is an indispensable partner to that.

And I think the ""America first"" had -- has more to do with what they believe is unfair trade practices. And -- and that's really at the heart of it, to get America back into making certain that we're getting our fair share. I think it has less implications on foreign policy.

WALLACE: Michele?

FLOURNOY: Yes, my -- what I hear from allies and partners around the world is they don't know what U.S. policy is. They hear something from the White House, or read a presidential tweet, and that's different from what they're hearing from the secretary of state, or the secretary of defense, or others who to try to reassure them.

I think we need to -- this administration needs to speak with one voice, and be very clear about what kind of leadership role the U.S. is willing to play in each of these areas, and what allies can count on us for. We need to be predictable and reliable leaders and partners.

WALLACE: General Keane, Michele Flournoy, thank you both.

FLOURNOY: Thank you.

KEANE: Great, Chris.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Another look at the Reagan Presidential Library on a mountaintop in California's Simi Valley.

This weekend has been a sentimental journey for me. During the Reagan presidency, I had the honor to serve as NBC's White House correspondent, covering the president as he traveled the world advancing America's interests.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The Soviet Union.

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) everywhere that you went in Europe, the foreign leaders opposed the Nicaraguan trade embargo and we now hear that Costa Rica has opposed it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But, most memorable were the four Reagan/Gorbachev summits which led to the end of the Cold War. Their first meeting in Geneva in 1985.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: One of the keys to this whole summit will be how these two men get on during the 12 hours they'll be spending together.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: And at President Reagan's right hand on all those trips, his trusted secretary of state, George Schultz. I got the chance here to revisit those days with him.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you about the art of negotiations. And you say rule number one is good ideas, strong policy.

You went into the first Reagan/Gorbachev summit with peace through strength, through the military buildup. We had it.

GEORGE SHULTZ, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER REAGAN: Well, strength is important. And a willingness to negotiate is important. But you want to negotiate from strength and on the basis of what you want.

If you want a deal too much, you’re going to get your head handed to you. You want a good deal, you don’t want just a deal.

WALLACE: Your second rule is you say that a negotiation is a learning process. You’ve got to figure out what are the core interests of the other party and what aren’t the core interests.

SHULTZ: Well, when you’re negotiating your opposite somebody and you’re talking to them back in forth. And one of the things to find out is, where is that person's bottom line? What are they really interested in? And what is fluff (ph)? And that will help you figure out how to make a deal.

WALLACE: Conversely, you say rule number three is credibility. No empty threats. Make it clear to your adversary, your negotiating partner, what are your core interests.

SHULTZ: Yes. Well, I had that drummed into me when I was a boot (ph) at the Marine Corps at the center of World War II. Sergeant hands me my rifle. He says, take good care of this rifle. This is your best friend. And remember one thing, never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger. No empty threats. Boot camp wisdom.

WALLACE: In actual negotiations, do you start big and then start giving things away, or do you start close to your bottom line?

SHULTZ: Well, we had – in the Reagan period, we had a bottom-line. We had what we wanted and we said what that was.

And you don't want to sort of build in things that you’re going to give away that you think are going to please the other guy. If you start thinking about his position, you’re going to be negotiating with yourself. It's best to be for what you're for and -- and hold on to that.

When we started out in the intermediate range nuclear weapons negotiation, our object was to have zero. And people said, that’s crazy, the Soviets have 1,500 deployed, we have none. What kind of a negotiating position is that? Well, we kept at it and we kept at it and who -- what happened? They signed an agreement in the White House where it was zero on both sides. So we got it.

WALLACE: Once you say something is off-limits, nonnegotiable, in the case of President Reagan, anti-missile defense, SDI, you can’t back down on that?

SHULTZ: No. Well, he was all for the SDI. He felt it had great promise. And it did turn out to be a wonderful bargaining chip. And actually we've learned a little bit about defense. We’re glad to have done that. But in the Reykjavík meeting, Gorbachev practically laid on the table all of our negotiating positions, which he agreed to, but he made conditional in what he said, keeping SDI confined to the library. And we interpret that as meaning kill it. So President Reagan wouldn't kill it. but in the end, all of the things that were laid out in Reykjavík and agreed to became agreements.

WALLACE: Mr. Secretary, they were great times. Thank you for sharing them with us.

SHULTZ: They were great times.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Secretary Shultz celebrates his 97th birthday later this month.

Before we go, a special thanks to the Reagan Library and the National Defense Forum for inviting us here.

Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan confirmed the news during a press conference on Friday, following reports that Delonda Walker — the manager at the McDonald’s in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa — might not be entitled to the entire reward amount.

Walker first tipped off police on Tuesday, after Donaldson, a 24-year-old co-worker, left his gun in her possession, The Tampa Bay Times reports. Police say they were later able to link the gun to a wave of killings in the Seminole Heights area between October and November.

One of the fundamental problems in Washington is the attitude that the money that people make belongs to the government. That’s why you hear arguments about how much a tax cut “costs,” or big government advocates disingenuously and breathlessly complaining about the people who pay taxes getting a tax cut.

I believe it is the other way around. Our default position should be that the money you earn belongs to you, and government has to justify why it should take it from you.

Currently, there are at least 97 different federal taxes. The tax code that instructs people how they must hand over their hard-earned money to government spans some 74,000-plus pages.

This is absurd, and so is the fact that government will collect over $3 trillion from taxpayers next year but still is not satisfied.

It’s similar to an idea recently patented by Ford that depicted a Mustang with two rails that slide out from inside the bumper and seems like a feature that’s primed to pop up on a production car soon.

The FT-AC technically isn’t one of them, but Toyota says it would be fitted with a lockable all-wheel-drive system if it were, and could also be equipped with a hybrid powertrain.

In a tweet, President Trump called for “top executives” at NBC and its parent company, Comcast, to be fired as well for “putting out so much fake news” on the heels of Lauer being fired from the network.

“Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for ‘inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.’ But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News,” Trump tweeted. “Check out Andy Lack’s past!”

Trump specifically called out Lack, 70, who had been conspicuously quiet since NBC came under fire for spiking Ronan Farrow’s report that would have outed Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator months before The New York Times and the New Yorker magazine eventually broke the news. Industry insiders have pondered for weeks if NBC News had been wary of running the Weinstein scoop due to its own problems inside 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

Lack and Lauer have long been known close personal friends, and pressure on Lack and NBC had been intensifying in recent weeks as word spread that multiple news organizations were reporting exposes on Lauer. Earlier this month, as reporters were closing in, NBC suddenly fired Lauer’s closest producer, Senior Vice President Matt Zimmerman, saying Zimmerman “engaged in inappropriate conduct with more than one woman”. Zimmerman’s firing came as a shock to industry insiders considering his close ties to Lauer who had enormous power at NBC.

“That firing was a sign that the end was coming,” one NBC insider said.

Lauer was believed to be the highest paid personality in TV news, reportedly earning $25 million per year. NBC even paid for him – at least for a time – to be helicoptered back and forth every weekend to Manhattan from his estate in New York’s exclusive Hamptons region on Long Island. At the time of his fall, Lauer exercised absolute power over the “Today” show and, through his close friend Lack, over the rest of NBC News.

NBC had backed Lauer firmly during the disastrous firing of his popular co-host Ann Curry in 2012, when the public widely blamed Lauer for bullying Curry out of her job (Lauer vociferously denied this). Lack, who arrived back at NBC shortly after Curry’s messy ouster, would go on to back his friend Lauer resolutely when the anchor was widely criticized for botching a town hall event between Trump and Hillary Clinton.

It was Lack who sent out the memo this morning announcing Lauer’s termination. Lack’s note said the employee complaint that led to Lauer’s downfall was the first complaint against Lauer in the host’s more than 20 years at NBC and that NBC had since come to believe the behavior cited was not an isolated incident. But, citing Trump’s tweet, industry insiders said the president, a former NBC star himself, could be throwing shade at Lack for suddenly claiming surprise and dismay at his close friend Lauer he’d known for decades.

“He’s like Captain Renault in ‘Casablanca’,” said one industry insider of Lack, citing a quote from the iconic movie when a police officer disingenuously expresses he was “shocked, shocked to find that gambling” was going on at a notorious bar. “The president is right. There needs to be some accountability from longtime NBC News management who only acted when forced by the press.”

When Trump mentioned Lack’s “past” in the tweet, he may also be referring to the period in 1998 and 1999 that Lack sat on an interview with Juanita Broaddrick accusing Bill Clinton of rape.

Back in 1999, while Lack was on his first tour as president of NBC News, the network's “Dateline” program conducted an interview in which Broaddrick gave a lengthy account of her alleged rape, but NBC didn’t air it until after until after Clinton’s impeachment hearing ended with acquittal.

Broaddrick has accused the network of editing out a portion of her interview in which she discussed Hillary Clinton’s role silencing her and other victims. She has recently called for Lack to re-air the interview in its entirety.

During the second Gulf War, when Lack was the president of all of NBC, NBC News was fiercely criticized for its allegedly credulous coverage of the U.S. campaign against Iraq, during which NBC’s correspondents and anchors bent over to appear patriotic and ventured little skepticism about the Bush Administration’s claims about Iraq’s weapons programs. Trump has fiercely criticized the war in Iraq as a “disaster” for the U.S.

More recently, Lack’s deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, has come under particular fire and calls to resign for spiking the Weinstein story. Lack has allowed Oppenheim -- who moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter and had sat a swanky event with Weinstein during NBC’s investigation of him -- to essentially take the heat for killing the Weinstein story.

As Oppenheim faced increasing calls to resign over the Weinstein fiasco, Lack remained silent, even though Oppenheim is regarded by NBC insiders as having little power compared to Lack’s enormous sway.

Trump ‘s attacks on NBC didn’t end with Lack this morning. The president also called out MSNBC President Phil Griffin, saying, “So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin?” It’s unclear if Trump – himself a longtime NBC insider -- was referring to possible bad personal behavior by Griffin, or if Trump was referring to his past criticisms of NBC as purveying “fake news” and being “disgusting” and “dishonest”.

“There's a real grave danger to China, to Russia, to all nations, by -- you know, from a North Korea that's armed with nuclear weapons.","National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster says neither the American people nor U.S. allies should question the stability of the Trump administration amid his predecessor Michael Flynn’s guilty plea and rumors Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is stepping down.

“No, I don't think our allies need any reassurance,” McMaster told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “In fact, what we're doing is continuing to work with them on all the key challenges we face today -- from North Korea, to the defeat of ISIS across the Greater Middle East -- the ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, too.”

McMaster reiterated that President Trump’s main priority is to protect American interests at home and abroad.

Tillerson will continue to be a part of that effort, McMaster said.

“I'm not aware of any plan at all” for Tillerson to resign, he said.

Wallace also asked McMaster about the president’s recent retweets of online posts linked to “Britain First,” a far-right group in the United Kingdom.

Last week, Trump retweeted a video that purported to show Muslim immigrants committing acts of violence. Those depicted in the footage reportedly were European-born.

Wallace noted that many British leaders – including Prime Minister Theresa May – voiced outrage at Trump, saying the president had “got it wrong” and risked needlessly stirring racial and ethnic discord.

“General, why did President Trump send out those videos?” Wallace asked.

“Well, President Trump is the best judge of why he did that,” McMaster said. “I know it was his intention to highlight the importance of creating safe and secure environments for our citizens -- to make sure that we have the right laws in place, enforcement mechanisms in place.”

Wallace then suggested that between the Britain First retweets and Trump’s support for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the president might be tossing away any hope of achieving Middle East peace during his presidency.

“No, the president's not giving up on the Mideast peace agreement at all,” McMaster said.

“There are options involving the move of an embassy at some point in the future, which I think, you know, could be used to gain momentum toward a -- toward a peace agreement, and a solution that works both for Israelis and for Palestinians,” McMaster added.

McMaster also addressed North Korea.

Last week, North Korea launched its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile – a provocation to which President Trump replied, “I will only tell you that we will take care of it.”

How exactly would the president “take care of it” given China and Russia’s complicity in propping up the regime, Wallace asked.

“Well, the president's going to take care of it by, if we have to, doing more ourselves,” McMaster said. “But what we want to do is convince others it is in their interest to do more.

“China, as you know, has taken some unprecedented actions. And what we're asking China to do is, not do us or anybody else a favor, but to act in China's interest.

“There's a real grave danger to China, to Russia, to all nations, by -- you know, from a North Korea that's armed with nuclear weapons. And of course, you have that direct threat, but you also have the threat of -- the potential of Japan, South Korea, others, arming themselves, possibly even with nuclear weapons. That is not in China's interest; it's not in Russia's interest.

“And so, what the president's saying is, we all need to take care of it. If necessary, the president and the United States will have to take care of it, because he has said he's not going to allow this murderous, rogue regime to threaten the United States with the most destructive weapons on the planet.”

A spokeswoman for Rex Hospital told the Associated Press that Tyvoris Solomon was in fair condition as of Saturday night.

Emergency medical personnel administered chest compressions before Solomon was transported off the court on a stretcher.

Solomon collapsed near the bench at the 13:08 mark of the game, causing the arena to fall silent. Cries rang out from people around the Bulldogs' bench as staff members fanned Solomon with a jacket.

Solomon, a 5-foot-10 senior guard, started the game and checked out at the 16:02 mark.

The game resumed after a 40-minute delay. Team spokesman Kendrick Lewis said S.C. State coach Murray Garvin went with Solomon to the hospital. Assistant Rio Pitt led the team for the remainder of the game.

""He's conscious, and he was talking some,"" Pitt said.

Once they knew that Solomon was conscious and able to speak, S.C. State's players decided to keep playing.

Christine Stone, whose mother Setsuko Harmon was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s eight years ago, said she had to remind her mother daily that she was going to be a grandmother throughout her pregnancy.

“It was a fun time,” Christine Stone, 39, told ABC News. “It was exciting to watch her reaction every time I’d tell her.”

Stone gave birth to Sadie Mae on Oct. 11, and later shared that the infant was diagnosed with Achondroplasia, which will require physical therapy.

MARRIAGE LINKED TO LOWER DEMENTIA RISK

“So today, we found out that our Sadie has Achondroplasia… she will be a little person,” Stone posted on Nov. 9. “The average height for a female with this condition is 4 foot 1 inch. We will have to see a few extra doctors and participate in some therapy throughout her growing years… she will take a little longer to sit up, crawl and walk but that will come with time. Other than the physical disabilities associated with this, Sadie is a healthy baby who has normal brain function and will have the same life span as you or I.”

Stone, of South Carolina, has continually posted updates on Sadie and new photos, as well as videos of the baby with her relatives. On Oct. 27, Stone shared a video of her mother singing a song called “Donguri Korokoro” to Sadie while she held her.

Stone explained that Harmon used to sing the song to her as a child, and that it’s about an acorn and an eel. The video has racked up more than 8,600 views on Stone’s personal Facebook page and has been covered by various news outlets.

“It really is special to watch her sing it to Sadie because I remember her singing it to me,” Stone told ABC News. “She would sing all these Japanese songs … when she would wash my hair in the shower. I thought it was pretty special that she can remember songs from way back when, over 30 years ago.”

Stone told the news outlet that her daughter’s birth has inspired Harmon to do more and visit often.

Dangerous conditions like these might leave you at risk of an accident as the days get colder.

Below are some strategies that may help you handle winter driving and inclement weather.

What are some tips I can follow?

There are two areas to focus on: preparing the car and preparing the occupants, Alex Epstein of the National Safety Council, a nonprofit safety group, told Fox News.

For your vehicle, get your fluids topped off and make sure there's ""proper antifreeze in the vehicle for windshield washers and the cooling system,"" he said.

""Cars these days have advanced driver assistance systems"" which can be blocked by snow, sleet and slush, he explained, adding that you should ""make sure those are clear.""

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends that before hitting the road, motorists take their vehicles to be serviced and also to see if they are part of a recall.

Drivers can also do another tune-up of sorts.

“When your area gets snow, practice driving on snow-covered or icy roads— but not on a main road,” the agency suggests. “Sharpen your winter weather driving skills and know how your vehicle handles in snowy conditions by practicing in an empty parking lot.”

LIQUID TIRE CHAIN: NO TRACTION? NO PROBLEM!

Are there certain items I should put in my car?

""Prepare an emergency kit,"" Epstein said. He recommended having coats, gloves and phone chargers.

Drivers may also wish to pack other items.

The NHTSA recommends blankets, flares, jumper cables, sand and a snow shovel. Motorists on long journeys should also have food, water, medication and phone chargers available, it advises.

What about other ideas?

""Slow down,"" Epstein stressed. ""Your car does not handle the same on a dry road as it does on a icy, slick road.""

You should also avoid driving next to slow plows, according to the NHTSA.

“The road behind an active snow plow is safer to drive on,” it explains. “If you find yourself behind a snow plow, stay behind it or use caution when passing.”

DRIVING TIPS FOR SNOW AND SLUSH

There are also things you can do if your vehicle gets stuck.

""Sometimes you're able to shovel a path so if you’ve slid off the road and damaged your vehicle, you can get back on the roadway,"" Epstein said.

If you're stuck and running the heat, keep your exhaust pipe clear: deadly emissions can get in the cabin of your vehicle if it's clogged, he explained.",Winter driving tips and precautions,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/11/30/winter-driving-tips-and-precautions.html

Democrats have a lot to say about the Republican tax-reform plan, including that it is a “middle class con job” and is going to cost the GOP its congressional majorities. That’s quite the bold claim, coming from the party that is in fact in uncharted tax-politics territory.

Americans have short political memories, which means it is no longer possible to remember a world in which Democrats didn’t hate tax cuts. And in the mainstream media—which shares the left’s penchant for class warfare—it’s also no longer possible to read an analysis that doesn’t assume Democrats are on the right side of history, that these tax cuts are “unpopular,” and that this reform holds grave political risks for Republicans.

Based on what? Democrats certainly have no modern evidence of these propositions, since they’ve never uniformly opposed tax cuts. In fact, it’s been 16 years since the party even engaged in a big tax brawl, during George W. Bush’s first year as president. What’s striking is just how many Democrats enthusiastically signed on to Mr. Bush’s tax bill, and just how far off the political rails the party has gone in the intervening years.

While the Bush tax package was hardly as sweeping as today’s reform, it contained similar provisions. It cut marginal rates across the board, even knocking nearly 5 points off the top marginal rate for the 1 percent. It cut capital-gains taxes and lowered the estate tax to zero in 2010, before the reductions expired. These are all cuts that House and Senate Democrats today uniformly decry as giveaways to the rich and powerful.

The bad news is, the renovation was done because an accused killer tried to dismember his victim in the bathtub.

The apartment where the self-described surrogate son of “jeweler to the stars” Jeffrey Rackover allegedly murdered a party guest with two buddies is now up for rent, The Post has learned.

Ex-con James Rackover allegedly tried to dismember victim Joey Comunale in the bathtub, which has been replaced with a sparkling, oversized shower stall.

The hardwood flooring was also refinished in both the bedroom and the living room, where court papers say James “created a bloody mess” by repeatedly smashing Comunale’s head against the boards during a fight that erupted after a night of partying.

THE OBAMAS' POTENTIAL NYC HOME WAS THE SITE OF TWO HIGH-PROFILE SUICIDES

The one-bedroom fourth-floor apartment inside the swank Grand Sutton high-rise at 418 E. 59th St. was rented for James Rackover by Jeffrey, who has been accused of engaging in a drug-fueled “intimate relationship’’ with the younger man.

The pad is being offered for $3,800 a month.

A real-estate agent handling the rental didn’t divulge the gory history during a walk-through Monday, claiming instead that “the owner decided most people don’t like to have a tub, they like to only have a shower.” But its past may still be haunting it.

The apartment has been on the market for more than 140 days, according to one online listing, and the agent said the owner was offering a month’s free rent to sweeten the deal.

The agent also said she was willing to cut her commission in half, from 15 to 7.5 percent of the first year’s rent.

GEORGE STRAIT'S CUSTOM-BUILT TEXAS MANSION UP FOR SALE

The apartment’s owner, Chista Ghaffari, insisted that the renovations had “nothing to do” with Comunale’s bloody death inside.

“I wanted to redo my apartment. It was my decision,” she said.

James Rackover and a co-defendant, Lawrence Dilione, are awaiting trial on the second-degree murder and related charges in the Nov. 13, 2016, beating and stabbing of Comunale, whose body was later burned and buried in a shallow grave in Oceanport, NJ.

A third defendant, Max Gemma — whose dad is a former Oceanport mayor — is charged with lying to cops about the incident.

But a trip to Boston Children’s Hospital and a two-week stay revealed a dire diagnosis of biliary atresia and set the family on a path that would connect them with a police officer in New Hampshire, Lt. Steven Tenney, who stepped forward to save their little girl.

- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.
Sources close to the various investigations agreed the discovery of Strzok’s texts raised important questions about his work on the Clinton email case, the Trump-Russia probe, and the dossier matter.","Two senior Justice Department officials have confirmed to Fox News that the department's Office of Inspector General is reviewing the role played in the Hillary Clinton email investigation by Peter Strzok, a former deputy director for counterintelligence at the FBI who was removed from the staff of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III earlier this year, after Mueller learned that Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump texts with a colleague.

A source close to the matter said the OIG probe, which will examine Strzok's roles in a number of other politically sensitive cases, should be completed by ""very early next year.""

The task will be exceedingly complex, given Strzok's consequential portfolio. He participated in the FBI's fateful interview with Hillary Clinton on July 2, 2016 – just days before then-FBI Director James Comey announced he was declining to recommend prosecution of Mrs. Clinton in connection with her use, as secretary of state, of a private email server.

As deputy FBI director for counterintelligence, Strzok also enjoyed liaison with various agencies in the intelligence community, including the CIA, then led by Director John Brennan.

Key figure

House investigators told Fox News they have long regarded Strzok as a key figure in the chain of events when the bureau, in 2016, received the infamous anti-Trump ""dossier"" and launched a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the election that ultimately came to encompass FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.

The ""dossier"" was a compendium of salacious and largely unverified allegations about then-candidate Trump and others around him that was compiled by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The firm's bank records, obtained by House investigators, revealed that the project was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has sought documents and witnesses from the Department of Justice and FBI to determine what role, if any, the dossier played in the move to place a Trump campaign associate under foreign surveillance.

Strzok himself briefed the committee on Dec. 5, 2016, the sources said, but within months of that session House Intelligence Committee investigators were contacted by an informant suggesting that there was “documentary evidence” that Strzok was purportedly obstructing the House probe into the dossier.

In early October, Nunes personally asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein – who has overseen the Trump-Russia probe since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions – to make Strzok available to the committee for questioning, sources said.

While Strzok’s removal from the Mueller team had been publicly reported in August, the Justice Department never disclosed the anti-Trump texts to the House investigators. The denial of access to Strzok was instead predicated, sources said, on broad ""personnel"" grounds.

When a month had elapsed, House investigators – having issued three subpoenas for various witnesses and documents – formally recommended to Nunes that DOJ and FBI be held in contempt of Congress. Nunes continued pressing DOJ, including a conversation with Rosenstein as recently as last Wednesday.

That turned out to be 12 days after DOJ and FBI had made Strzok available to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

Contempt citations?

Responding to the revelations about Strzok’s texts on Saturday, Nunes said he has now directed his staff to draft contempt-of-Congress citations against Rosenstein and the new FBI director, Christopher Wray. Unless DOJ and FBI comply with all of his outstanding requests for documents and witnesses by the close of business on Monday, Nunes said, he would seek a resolution on the contempt citations before year’s end.

“We now know why Strzok was dismissed, why the FBI and DOJ refused to provide us this explanation, and at least one reason why they previously refused to make [FBI] Deputy Director [Andrew] McCabe available to the Committee for an interview,” Nunes said in a statement.

""We now know why Strzok was dismissed, why the FBI and DOJ refused to provide us this explanation, and at least one reason why they previously refused to make [FBI] Deputy Director [Andrew] McCabe available to the Committee for an interview."" - House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.

Early Saturday afternoon, after Strzok’s texts were cited in published reports by the New York Times and the Washington Post – and Fox News had followed up with inquiries about the department’s refusal to make Strzok available to House investigators – the Justice Department contacted the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan to establish a date for Strzok’s appearance before House Intelligence Committee staff, along with two other witnesses long sought by the Nunes team.

Those witnesses are FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and the FBI officer said to have handled Christopher Steele, the British spy who used Russian sources to compile the dossier for Fusion GPS. The official said to be Steele’s FBI handler has also appeared already before the Senate panel.

The Justice Department maintained that the decision to clear Strzok for House interrogation had occurred a few hours prior to the appearance of the Times and Post stories.

In addition, Rosenstein is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 13.

The Justice Department maintains that it has been very responsive to the House intel panel's demands, including private briefings for panel staff by senior DOJ and FBI personnel and the production of several hundred pages of classified materials available in a secure reading room at DOJ headquarters on Oct. 31.

Behind the scenes

Sources said Speaker Ryan has worked quietly behind the scenes to try to resolve the clash over dossier-related evidence and witnesses between the House intel panel on the one hand and DOJ and FBI on the other. In October, however, the speaker took the unusual step of saying publicly that the two agencies were ""stonewalling"" Congress.

All parties agree that some records being sought by the Nunes team belong to categories of documents that have historically never been shared with the committees that conduct oversight of the intelligence community.

Federal officials told Fox News the requested records include “highly sensitive raw intelligence,” so sensitive that officials from foreign governments have emphasized to the U.S. the “potential danger and chilling effect” it could place on foreign intelligence sources.

Justice Department officials noted that Nunes did not appear for a document-review session that his committee’s ranking Democrat, U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., attended, and once rejected a briefing by an FBI official if the panel’s Democratic members were permitted to attend.

Sources close to the various investigations agreed the discovery of Strzok’s texts raised important questions about his work on the Clinton email case, the Trump-Russia probe, and the dossier matter.

“That’s why the IG is looking into all of those things,” a Justice Department official told Fox News on Saturday.

A top House investigator asked: “If Mueller knew about the texts, what did he know about the dossier?”

Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, said: “Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel’s Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation.”

Carr declined to comment on the extent to which Mueller has examined the dossier and its relationship, if any, to the counterintelligence investigation that Strzok launched during the height of the campaign season.

District Attorney Ernie Lee told reporters that divers recovered the body in Pender County, about 25 miles from Mariah's home in Jacksonville. He added that they were awaiting a medical examiner's report to determine the official cause of death.

The body was found hours after Earl Kimrey, the live-in boyfriend of Mariah's mother, was arrested and held on $1 million bond. He is charged with concealing of death, obstruction of justice, second-degree burglary, felony larceny and possession of stolen property. Prosecutors are reviewing whether additional charges should be filed.

According to arrest warrants, Kimrey removed the girl's body from the place where she died and knew her death was not natural.

Mariah was reported missing Monday morning by her mother, who said she last saw her when she put her to bed the night before.

""It was too late to save Mariah the moment the 911 call came in,"" FBI agent Stanley Meador said. ""The arrest warrants are public record and the records speaks for themselves. We will not discuss any details related to the homicide investigation.""

Kristy Woods made tearful pleas for her daughter's return. ""This is my world, this is my angel,"" she said.

Earlier Saturday, the FBI asked for any business or residents with security cameras near U.S. Highway 17 or state Highway 53 in the area where the girl disappeared to call police and let them see the footage.

""Allow us to review it to determine if it is of investigative value,"" Meador said.

Mariah's father, who has been involved in a custody dispute with her mother, has criticized her version of events.

""Someone just walked right up in there, grabbed the 3-year-old out of the bed and she didn't cry, she didn't scream?"" Alex Woods told WCTI-TV in New Bern earlier in the week. ""Nobody heard anything? Four people in the house, two adults and two kids someone just comes up and snatches the baby and walks out?""

Lauer, the former “Today” co-anchor, was fired from the network last week after an NBC employee told executives of his alleged sexual misconduct.
But even before the allegations publicly surfaced, local residents of the Hamptons told Page Six that Lauer and Roque had been living separate lives for quite some time.
Lauer reportedly offered $5 million to Roque in order to save the marriage, according to Page Six.
While Roque remains silent on her husband’s firing and sexual harassment allegations, Nancy Alspaugh, Lauer’s first wife, has come to his defense, Fox News reported.","In the wake of Matt Lauer’s firing from NBC over alleged sexual misconduct, his wife, Annette Roque, has reportedly been hiding from reporters in the couple’s home in New York's Hamptons.

Despite earlier rumors that suggested Roque took the kids and fled the country, a source told the New York Post that Lauer’s wife was still on Long Island, and the couple’s 14-year-old daughter was spotted leaving their home Saturday morning.

Lauer, the former “Today” co-anchor, was fired from the network last week after an NBC employee told executives of his alleged sexual misconduct.

Lauer allegedly “gave a colleague a sex toy” and “had a button under his desk” that locked his door when he wanted privacy to “initiate inappropriate contact” with female employees, Variety reported.

Several more women have since spoken out against Lauer.

But even before the allegations publicly surfaced, local residents of the Hamptons told Page Six that Lauer and Roque had been living separate lives for quite some time.

Employees at a Hamptons boutique told the paper that people in town consider Roque “a sad wife,” adding that Lauer “is never with Annette.”

Meanwhile, Lauer’s neighbors in New York City say that whenever they see him, he is never with his wife, the paper reported.

Lauer, who divorced his first wife, was on the cusp of split from Roque after she reportedly learned of an affair he allegedly had with an NBC colleague in 2006, according to the paper. However, the divorce was called off just three weeks after the initial filing.

Lauer reportedly offered $5 million to Roque in order to save the marriage, according to Page Six.

While Roque remains silent on her husband’s firing and sexual harassment allegations, Nancy Alspaugh, Lauer’s first wife, has come to his defense, Fox News reported.

Alspaugh told ""Entertainment Tonight"" that Lauer, to whom she was married from 1981 to 1989, is ""incredibly nice, incredibly charming and incredibly willing to help anybody,” adding that the allegations against Lauer were “out of character.”

Lauer issued an apology on Thursday, saying “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt I am truly sorry.”","Lauer's spouse, Annette Roque, known as 'sad wife' in Hamptons town: report",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/03/lauers-spouse-annette-roque-known-as-sad-wife-in-hamptons-town-report.html

Editor's note: The following column is adapted from a post which originally appeared on AEIdeas.org, the blog of the American Enterprise Institute.

The Washington Post reports that North Korea has carried out its first ballistic missile test in more than two months:

North Korea launched a missile early Wednesday morning, South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said. . . Wednesday’s missile was launched from Pyongan province and fired to the east, South Korea’s joint chiefs said, according to the Yonhap News Agency. The military was still working to ascertain what kind of missile it was.

North Korea last fired a missile on Sept. 15, sending it over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It was the second launch over Japan in less than three weeks and came less than two weeks after North Korea exploded what was widely believed to be a hydrogen bomb.

In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations at the end of last month, Joseph Yun, the State Department’s special representative for North Korea policy, said that if North Korea went 60 days without testing a missile or a nuclear weapon, it could be a sign that Pyongyang was open to dialogue.

Apparently they are not so open to dialogue after all. Indeed, the North Korean launch is a finger in the eye to China, which had just sent a high level envoy to Pyongyang at President Trump’s request. Trump tweeted hopefully about the Chinese visit: “China is sending an Envoy and Delegation to North Korea – A big move, we’ll see what happens!” What happened was a big middle finger to Beijing and Washington from “Little Rocket Man.”

Here is how Trump should respond: Take out the test site from which the North Koreans launched the missile toward Japan — just like he struck the military base in Syria from which the Assad regime had launched a chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.",Thiessen: Trump Should Take Out the Site Where North Korea Just Launched a Missile,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/29/thiessen-trump-should-take-out-site-where-north-korea-just-launched-missile#commenting

Croque Shorey

Serves 1 or 2

A Croque Monsieur is the classic French grilled ham and cheese sandwich, and the Croque Madame is a similar sandwich made with chicken rather than ham. This croque is made with Shorey's favorite ingredients: sharp white cheddar cheese, roast turkey, spinach, and tomatoes, on hearty multigrain bread. The recipe makes a very large, flavorful sandwich. It consists of seven layers--bread, cheese, turkey, spinach, tomato slices, cheese, and then bread. It can also be served unbaked. The sandwich is very good served with a green salad.

It can be assembled way ahead and then baked for about 15 minutes in a 400-degree oven when ready to serve. It takes that amount of time to soften the tomato, melt the cheese, and brown the bread properly. Although the spinach could be added raw, the amount is voluminous (about 2 cups) and would be hard to secure between the bread slices, so I microwave it for 1 minute to wilt it and make it easy to fit into the sandwich.

2 large slices multigrain bread (4 ounces; about 7 by 4 inches)

4 slices sharp white cheddar cheese (about 3 ounces)

About 3 ounces sliced cooked turkey

2 lightly packed cups (2 ounces) baby spinach, microwaved for 1 minute

1 small ripe tomato (about 4 ounces), cut into 4 or 5 slices

1 tablespoon peanut or olive oil

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Lay the bread slices on the counter and cover one of them with 2 slices of the cheese. Top with the sliced turkey and then the blanched spinach. Cover with the tomato slices, then add the remaining 2 slices cheese and, finally, the second slice of bread.

Pour the oil onto an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet and spread it evenly to about the dimensions of the sandwich. Press the sandwich into it, then turn the sandwich over so it is oiled on both sides. Bake for 15 minutes, until the bread is brown, the tomatoes are soft, the cheese is melted, and the inside of the sandwich is warm. Remove from the oven, cut in half, and serve right away.

Chicken Jardiniere

Serves 4

My mother made this type of stew from the carcass of a raw chicken and its gizzards; I use pancetta instead of gizzards for additional flavor and chicken legs, which stay moist during the cooking. Jardiniere means ""gardener"" in French, and the vegetables change according to what is in season or in my garden. The stew is easy to put together, and it gets better every time you reheat it.

2 ½ ounces lean pancetta, cut into lardons (strips about 1 inch long and½ inch thick)

1 ½ tablespoons peanut oil

4 chicken legs (about 2 3/4 pounds), left whole or cut into 2 pieces each, ends of the drumsticks and skin removed (about 2 1/4 pounds trimmed)

1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

¾ cup fruity dry white wine

¾ cup water

12 small red potatoes (about 8 ounces), peeled

8 small baby bella or cremini mushrooms (about 5 ounces), washed

12 small pearl onions (about 4 ounces)

1 ¼ cups diced (1-inch) carrots

1 ½ tablespoons coarsely chopped garlic

1 fresh thyme branch

1 cup frozen baby peas

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Saute the lardons in the oil in a large saucepan or a Dutch oven (the pan should be wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer) over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and sauté them, turning once, for about 8 minutes, until lightly browned. Sprinkle with the flour, salt, and pepper and move the chicken around to distribute the flour evenly. Cook for 1 minute, then add the wine and water and mix well.

Add the potatoes, mushrooms, onions, carrots, garlic, and thyme and mix well. Bring to a full boil, making sure that the stew is boiling throughout, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 45 minutes. (The stew can be prepared ahead to this point and reheated to serve.)

At serving time, add the peas to the stew, bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes.

Transfer the stew to individual plates or a large platter, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.

if you haven't had your fill of turkey, you can always go for round 2. A contender from Milk Street.

Recipe: Tea-Rubbed Maple Turkey

Start to finish: 3 to 3½ hours (plus 24 hours to season)

Servings: 12

This aromatic, richly seasoned holiday turkey gets much of its flavor from lapsang souchong, a smoked black Chinese tea. We added the flavor in two layers. First, we used loose tea to make a flavorful rub for the meat. We then mirrored that flavor by using brewed tea as part of a rich maple glaze. To brew the tea, steep eight tea bags in ¾ cup boiling water; let sit until cooled, then squeeze out all the liquid from the tea bags. You should have ½ cup brewed tea. If using a frozen turkey, make sure it is completely thawed. And if your turkey has a pop-up thermometer, remove and discard it before rubbing the bird with the tea rub.

Don't cover the turkey before it goes into the refrigerator; leaving it uncovered helps dry the skin overnight, which produces crispier skin.

For the turkey and gravy:

6 bags lapsang souchong tea, emptied (9 grams)

1 tablespoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon ground white pepper

12- to 14-pound turkey, neck and giblets discarded

4 cups plus 3 tablespoons water, divided

2 tablespoons cornstarch

For the glaze:

½ cup pure maple syrup

½ cup strong brewed lapsang souchong tea (see note above)

¼ cup soy sauce

2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar

½ teaspoon ground white pepper

To prepare the turkey, set a roasting rack inside a large roasting pan. Using paper towels, pat the turkey dry inside and out. Tuck the wings underneath. Gently push your hand under the skin over the breasts, thighs and drumsticks to loosen. In a small bowl, combine the tea, salt and white pepper. Using your hands, spread half the mixture evenly under the skin. Sprinkle the remaining mixture over the skin, rubbing to coat evenly. Set the turkey breast side up on the roasting rack and refrigerate, uncovered, for 24 hours.

Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lowest position. Pour 4 cups of the water into the roasting pan. Pull the turkey legs up and forward and insert a long skewer through one thigh to the other thigh (see sidebar). Roast for 2 hours; the thickest part of the thigh should register 155°F to 160°F.

While the turkey roasts, prepare the glaze. In a large saucepan over medium, combine the maple syrup, brewed tea and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until large bubbles form, adjusting the heat to prevent boiling over, 8 to 10 minutes; you should have about ¾ cup glaze. Reserve ¼ cup; transfer the remaining ½ cup glaze to a small bowl, stir in the vinegar and white pepper and reserve to serve with the turkey.

Remove the turkey from the oven and brush with half of the reserved ¼ cup of glaze. Return the turkey to the oven and roast until the thickest part of the breast registers 160°F and the thigh registers 175°F, brushing with the remaining glaze every 30 minutes, 1 to 1½ hours longer. Tilt the turkey to let the liquid run out of the cavity into the pan, then transfer to a carving board. Let rest for 45 minutes.

To make the gravy, pour the liquid from the roasting pan into a fat separator and let settle for about 5 minutes. Pour 2 cups of defatted liquid into a large saucepan over medium-high and bring to a simmer. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 3 tablespoons water and cornstarch. Whisk the mixture into the simmering liquid and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy and the reserved glaze.

Cranberry Crackle Tart Makes 6 servings

For the filling

2 tablespoons chunky cherry, raspberry or strawberry jam

2 large egg whites, at room temperature

Pinch of fine sea salt

½ cup (100 grams) sugar

1½ cups (about 150 grams) cranberries (if they're frozen, don't thaw)

Confectioners' sugar, for dusting (optional)

Butter a 9-inch pie pan (I use a Pyrex pan) and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

Sandwich the dough between two sheets of parchment or wax paper and roll it out until it is a scant 1/8 inch thick. Don't worry about making a beautiful circle, because you're going to trim the dough.

Fit the dough into the pie pan, allowing the excess to drape over the sides. Gently press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan and then, using a paring knife, a pizza wheel or a fluted ravioli wheel, trim the dough to about one third down from the rim of the pan. Prick the bottom of the tart shell all over with a fork and freeze for at least 30 minutes. (The leftover dough makes a nice turnover.)

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Line the crust with a piece of parchment or a buttered piece of aluminum foil and weight it down with rice, dried beans or light pie weights. Bake the crust for 20 minutes, then carefully remove the paper and weights and bake for 8 to 12 minutes more, or until the crust is golden. The crust will have shrunk, but that's fine. Set the crust on a rack to cool to room temperature.

When you're ready to fill and bake the tart: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Spoon the jam into the crust and spread it evenly over the bottom. Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt at medium speed just until they turn opaque. With the mixer going, add the sugar in a very slow, steady stream, then keep beating until the whites are shiny and form peaks with pretty, droopy tips; they will look like marshmallow.

Pour the cranberries into the bowl and, using a flexible spatula, fold them into the meringue. Try to distribute the fruit evenly, but don't try too hard-- you want to keep the meringue fluffy. Turn the meringue over the jam and spread it to the edges, making it swirly if you'd like. The jam will sneak up around the sides of the meringue, and that's fine.

Bake the tart for 1 hour, at which point the top will be light beige and most probably cracked here and there. (If you'd like more color, you can bake it longer or put it under the broiler.) Transfer the tart to a cooling rack and cool to room temperature. If you'd like, dust the tart with confectioners' sugar before serving.

Serving: Just before serving, it's nice to sprinkle the top of the tart with confectioners' sugar. In France, I've seen some meringue tarts served with whipped cream and some with ice cream. I thought that adding whipped or ice cream would be too much--I was wrong.

Storing: The tart is best served the day it's made, although it's still pretty nice a day later. Leave the tart at room temperature, covering only the cut part with a piece of wax paper or plastic film.

Sweet Tart Dough Makes one 9- to 9½-inch crust

Used by so many French pastry chefs for so many French tarts, this is the dough that I turn to automatically when I've got a tart on my mind. Known as pâte sablée, it's really a sweet cookie dough, the one you'd use to make a tender sablé or shortbread cookie.

I always prebake the crust even if it's going to get another long bake with the filling, because I like the resulting color, flavor and texture--and the fact that the bottom won't be soggy.

I use a fluted tart pan with a removable base. If all you've got is a pie plate, don't let that stop you.

A word on rolling versus pressing: You can roll the crust out and fit it into the tart pan or just press it in. I roll the dough. Rolling gives you a thinner crust than pressing, so if you press, you might occasionally find yourself with a little filling left over.

1½ cups (204 grams) all-purpose flour

½ cup (60 grams) confectioners' sugar

¼ teaspoon fine sea salt

9 tablespoons (4½ ounces;

128 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

1 large egg yolk

To make the dough: Put the flour, confectioners' sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse a couple of times to blend. Scatter the pieces of butter over the dry ingredients and pulse until the butter is cut in coarsely--you'll have some pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and some the size of peas. Stir the yolk just to break it up and add it a little at a time, pulsing after each addition. When the egg is incorporated, process in long pulses--about 10 seconds each--until the dough, which will look granular soon after the egg is added, forms clumps and curds. Just before you reach this clumpy stage, the sound of the machine working the dough will change--heads-up. Turn the dough out onto a work surface.

To incorporate the butter more evenly and to catch any dry ingredients that might have escaped mixing, separate small amounts of dough from the pile and use the heel of your hand to smear each piece a few inches across the counter. In French this is called fraisage, and it's the ideal way to finish blending a dough.

To make a rolled-out crust: Shape the dough into a disk and put it between two sheets of parchment or wax paper. Roll the dough out evenly, turning it over frequently and lifting the paper often so that it doesn't roll into the dough and form creases. Aim for a circle that's at least 3 inches larger than the base of your tart pan. The dough will be 1/8 to 1/16 inch thick, but it's the diameter, not the thickness, that counts. Slide the rolled-out dough, still between the papers, onto a baking sheet or cutting board and refrigerate for 2 hours or freeze it for 1 hour. (The dough can be refrigerated overnight or frozen for up to 2 months; wrap it airtight to freeze.)

When the dough is thoroughly chilled, put it on the counter and let it rest for about 10 minutes, or until it's just pliable enough to bend without breaking. Remove the dough from the paper, fit it into a buttered tart pan and trim the excess dough even with the edges of the pan. (If you'd like, you can fold the excess over and make a thicker wall around the sides of the tart.) Prick the crust all over with a fork and freeze for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.

To make a press-in crust: Butter the tart pan and press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. You won't need all of the dough if you want to make a thin crust, but I think it's nice to make a thickish one so that you can really enjoy the texture. Press the pieces of dough in so that they cling to one another and will knit together when baked, but don't use a lot of force--working lightly will preserve the crust's shortbready texture. Prick the crust all over with a fork and freeze for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer, before baking.

When you're ready to bake: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil (or use nonstick foil) and fit the foil snugly into the crust. If the crust is frozen, you can bake it as is; if not, fill it with dried beans or rice (which you can reuse as weights but won't be able to cook after they've been used this way).

To partially bake the crust: Bake for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the foil (and weights). If the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. Transfer the crust to a cooling rack (keep it in its pan).

To fully bake the crust: Bake the crust for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the foil (and weights). If the crust has puffed, press it down gently with the back of a spoon. Bake the crust for another 7 to 10 minutes, or until it is firm and golden brown. Transfer the crust to a cooling rack (keep it in its pan).

Storing: Well wrapped, the dough can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 2 months. While the fully baked crust can be packed airtight and frozen for up to 2 months, I prefer to freeze the crust fitted into the pan but not baked and then to bake it directly from the freezer--it will have a fresher flavor. Just add about 5 minutes to the baking time.

Bonne Idée - Sweet Tart Dough with Nuts: Reduce the all-purpose flour to 1¼ cups and add ¼ cup almond or hazelnut flour (or very finely ground pecans or pistachios). Proceed as directed on the previous page.

The video released Wednesday by the Fort Worth Police Department started with roll call and the distribution of assignments.

“No. The Wookiee,” the officer said, before the camera cut back to Jimmy staring at his new partner.

But in a seemingly normal day of activities for the twosome, the Wookiee’s unique skill set didn’t appear to translate that well to the world of law enforcement.

A routine traffic stop ended with Chewbacca shaking a woman’s car, practice time at the firing range led to an out-of-this-world explosion and combat training left another officer at a bit of a disadvantage.

Jimmy also had an issue with the Wookiee after he didn’t clean his hair out of the shower drain.

And in an ode to the fallen Han Solo, Jimmy attempted to console a sad Wookiee during lunch.

“Hey… I’m sorry about Han,” Jimmy said. As a distraught Chewbacca got up and left, the officer shouted, “You wanna talk about it?”

Officials were supposed to conduct a partial implosion of the Pontiac Silverdome around 8:30 a.m., with a blast originally set to break the metal beams supporting the upper ring of the dome and causing the structure to fall to the ground.

But after some blasts went off and a plume of smoke enveloped the former home of the Detroit Lions, the structure was still standing.

City officials told FOX 2 Detroit the implosion failed, adding that ""what was supposed to happen, did not.""

The initial blast was supposed to break the metal beams supporting the upper ring of the dome, a 20-foot steel band that held up the equipment used to inflate the roof, according to FOX 2 Detroit.

The vertical beams surrounding the Silverdome were supposed to be broken when a small charge detonated, causing the steel ring to fall to the ground. That was not the case Sunday, and several beams remained.

Demolition company Adamo told the Detroit Free Press the blasts did weaken the Silverdome and it could still fall, but it's unclear when that might happen.

Rick Cuppetilli, the executive vice president at Adamo, told the newspaper that 10 percent of the explosive charges in eight key locations failed to detonate due to wiring issues that crews are investigating.

""Unless we find something in the next few hours researching the wiring, we will take it down mechanically,"" Cuppetilli said. ""We haven't found the wire yet. It's going to take us a while to research it all.""

The demolition team told FOX 2 there will not be any additional blasts Sunday, and that the weakened building could actually fall in on its own at some point.

The demolition of the iconic stadium is expected to involve crews using hydraulic excavators to take care of the rest of the structure in sections.

A total of 1,800 tons of rebar and 1,700 tons of structural steel are expected to be recycled at a city plant and take about a year to complete.

The Silverdome property sits on 127 acres and was last used as home of the Detroit Lions in 2001. The stadium, located about 30 miles north of Detroit, once hosted the Super Bowl, the Pistons, WrestleMania III, the World Cup and Pope John Paul II's visit.","Pontiac Silverdome, former home of the Detroit Lions, has failed partial implosion",http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/12/03/pontiac-silverdome-former-home-detroit-lions-has-failed-partial-implosion.html

That's a typo. It should read Blake Shelton Sexist Man Alive. — Perry D Playford (@playford_p) November 15, 2017 blake shelton is even less sexy when you find out he’s racist and homophobic and sexist and all around a gross dude — josh lyman, human disaster (@andlivefromny) November 15, 2017 Maybe it's a typo, and Blake Shelton was meant to be named the most Sexist Man Alive? It's the only way my brain can logically make sense of this result. — Jay Thomas (@ThisJayThomas) November 15, 2017 Ah yes! A homophobe, islamaphobhic racist is always a great idea to have as the sexiest man alive! — .. (@bachelorworld_) November 15, 2017

However, many fans felt the title was well-deserved.

""Everyone knows comedy has been a major part of my career and it’s always been out there for anyone to see,” he said in 2016. “That said anyone that knows me also knows I have no tolerance of hate of any kind or form...I deeply apologize to anybody who may have been offended.""",Blake Shelton's 'Sexiest Man Alive' title angers some fans because of singer's past tweets,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/15/blake-sheltons-sexiest-man-alive-title-angers-some-fans-because-singers-past-tweets.html

Animal rights activists are, bizarrely, taking their fight to the humans who are actively saving animals – cancer researchers.
Animal research gives sick pets a second chance – and lays the groundwork for treatments that could save others down the line.
Animal lovers should support animal research, not condemn it.","Every year, 12 million cats and dogs in the United States are diagnosed with cancer. For their owners, that diagnosis is both emotionally and financially devastating. The initial cancer diagnosis alone can cost $2,000. Subsequent chemotherapy and radiation can run up to $10,000.

Fortunately, scientists are on the cusp of discovering treatments that could help pets with cancer at a much lower cost – if we let them continue the animal medical research needed to make those discoveries. But all over the country, self-professed animal lovers are lobbying for limits on – or even an end to – medical research involving animals.

That's counterproductive, because animals are among the primary beneficiaries of such research. Consequently, animal lovers should be among the biggest supporters of animal medical research.

Consider work that's underway at the University of Minnesota. Earlier this year, scientists began clinical trials for a new treatment for hemangiosarcoma – a cancer that emerges from the blood vessels and kills half of dogs that contract it within six months. In the trial, the new therapy boosted six-month survival rates by 70 percent.

Or look to Colorado State University's Flint Animal Cancer Center, where clinical veterinarians conduct long-term outpatient studies for a variety of new treatments. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a drug tested at the center that helped 80 percent of dogs with lymphoma, a cancer that develops in the immune system.

Pets are already benefitting directly from this research. Take Q Bentley, a dog from Washington, D.C., profiled by Bioscience Technology, a trade journal for scientists. Earlier this year, Q was diagnosed with a brain tumor and given only a few months to live.

Her owners decided to enroll her in a clinical trial for a new treatment at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Tech. Within a matter of weeks, Q's tumor shrank 50 percent. She's now happy and healthy.

Dogs aren't the only beneficiaries of such cutting-edge research. A new intravenous treatment developed at the University of Illinois has been shown to halve the size of tumors in cats with certain types of mouth cancer.

Some scientists are developing interventions that can prevent animals from getting cancer in the first place.

Years of animal trials have yielded a vaccine that shields cats from feline leukemia virus, which kills 85 percent of persistently infected cats within a few years.

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have identified a protein that's present in greater-than-normal quantities in dogs with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer that afflicts more than 10,000 dogs a year. Eight in ten of these dogs don't live more than a year after their diagnosis. Future research could determine whether the protein actually causes tumor production – and which genes are responsible for ordering higher concentrations of the protein.

Despite all this scientific progress – and the many animals that have benefited from it – nearly half of all Americans oppose research in animals, according to a recent Gallup survey. Almost six in 10 voters want to cut federal funding for testing on dogs and cats.

Animal rights activists are, bizarrely, taking their fight to the humans who are actively saving animals – cancer researchers.

Consider People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. This fall, PETA launched a public pressure campaign calling for Texas A&M scientists to stop research in dogs that could yield new treatments for muscular dystrophy, which can afflict dogs, cats and humans alike.

If groups like PETA were serious about their advocacy on behalf of animals, they'd lobby for even more research like that at Texas A&M, which could save countless pets – and humans, too – from a lifetime of pain and suffering.

Animal research gives sick pets a second chance – and lays the groundwork for treatments that could save others down the line. It's also responsible for some of the greatest breakthroughs in modern medical history, including the eradication of smallpox, innovative treatments for malaria, and the management of diabetes. All of these developments have helped both animals and humans.

Animal lovers should support animal research, not condemn it. Such research ensures that our beloved pets will be able to live longer, healthier lives.","Animal lovers should support animal research, not condemn it.

Many of us have piles upon boxes upon albums of photos that we haven’t picked up in years. This month marks the season of gratitude - the perfect time to take a trip down memory lane. Here are eight ways to finally organize, use and declutter your family photos.

Research. If you’re a history buff or just curious about the strangers staring back at you with striking resemblance, there are a few measures you can take to piece together your family tree. If you know where the photos were taken, dedicate a rainy afternoon to poring over information at the local library. Some newspapers will print photos with a caption asking readers if they recognize people in the picture. You can also hire a genealogist or upload photos online to genealogy sites if you’re willing to pay for research.

Donate. Most of us find it difficult to throw photos away, let alone ones that have been passed down from generation to generation. If you can’t find any connection to your collection, most historical societies accept photos, especially if you can provide some information about how you inherited them.

Reminisce. Pass around family photos and albums at your next family gathering. Stoke the fire and let the storytelling begin! This is a great chance to learn more about your family and introduce your kids to their late relatives who they never met, but can still get to know through cherished photo albums.

Digitize. Printed photos are typically stored in attics, basements and closets and are therefore susceptible to fires, floods and dust. Preserve photos by scanning them yourself, shipping them to a scanning service or hiring someone to scan them for you. Saving photos to the cloud will give them a safe home where they’ll stay vibrant forever.

Display. Gallery walls are very popular in today’s home designs. Use frames all in the same color for a consistent, contemporary look or arrange frames in different shapes and sizes around other wall decor for an eclectic vibe. Hang photos on a wall with track lighting to put your photos in the spotlight.

Scrapbook. Scrapbooks make meaningful holiday gifts full of creativity and personalization. Get the whole family involved by giving each child an age-appropriate task, like taping or labeling, or assign them few pages to complete on their own. If you’re making these books for your own home, make sure you keep them in an accessible place rather than storage so you can enjoy them more often.

DIY. Go to any craft store and you’ll find that there are so many more creative ways to use and display photos beyond frames and scrapbooks. Buy a big jar of Mod Podge and create playful collages or make ornaments for the Christmas tree. You could also arrange photos under glass on a dresser or desktop to enjoy them in every room.

Delete. After you’ve backed up your collection with digital copies, you can feel better about throwing away printed photos that you didn’t display or use. It’s also important to declutter your digital collection so that it’s easier to find and share photos online. You can safely delete the following from your devices: duplicates; blurry or dark shots; unphotogenic moments you know you will never share or display; and shutter mistakes, like accidental shots of the ceiling or the contents of your purse.",What to do with all of your family photos,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/what-to-do-with-all-your-family-photos.html

They also read double the number of online reviews of any potential eatery than a boomer does before making a decision.
Additionally, those on the West Coast were also more likely to rely on online reviews than any other region.
Millennials were three times more likely to seek out photos of a restaurant and its dishes than the over 55’s.
Millennials are also three times more likely to not eat at a restaurant because the business is lacking a website.","Millennials are the pickiest generation yet when it comes to their food, new research reveals.

A study into the expectations and patience levels of 2,000 people when dining at a restaurant found that millennials are almost twice as likely (34 percent vs. 18 percent) to feel like a meal isn’t up to standard, compared to those over the age of 55.

The survey, commissioned by GoDaddy, showed that millennials are not only harder to please when it comes to the quality of service, but they’re also generally pickier about the restaurants they choose to eat at and how they make decisions about where to eat, including a business’ online presence and social media platforms.

When choosing a restaurant, millennials are the generation that depends the most on the opinions of others and the age group most likely to be swayed by a friend’s recommendation. They also read double the number of online reviews of any potential eatery than a boomer does before making a decision.

In fact, millennials put a lot of faith in online reviews overall; 60 percent decided against eating at a restaurant after reading bad online reviews — more than any other age group surveyed. Additionally, those on the West Coast were also more likely to rely on online reviews than any other region.

The digital experience of any food-related business is increasingly essential to its success. Millennials were more likely to search through menus online and look at a restaurant’s Instagram photos before checking it out in person than any generation before them. While it’s perhaps not shocking that they would be more active on social media, they are increasingly visually motivated. Millennials were three times more likely to seek out photos of a restaurant and its dishes than the over 55’s.

One in ten millennials even go as far as to judge a restaurant based solely on the content and quality of their website — compared to just one in 100 restaurant-goers over 55. The older generation instead places slightly more emphasis on the overall ambiance of the place once inside than their younger counterparts.

Millennials are also three times more likely to not eat at a restaurant because the business is lacking a website.

The Silverdome property sits on 127 acres and was last used as home of the Detroit Lions in 2001.","An iconic sports stadium in the Detroit area was supposed to meet its end on Sunday, but not everything went according to plan.

Officials were supposed to conduct a partial implosion of the Pontiac Silverdome around 8:30 a.m., with a blast originally set to break the metal beams supporting the upper ring of the dome and causing the structure to fall to the ground.

But after some blasts went off and a plume of smoke enveloped the former home of the Detroit Lions, the structure was still standing.

City officials told FOX 2 Detroit the implosion failed, adding that ""what was supposed to happen, did not.""

The initial blast was supposed to break the metal beams supporting the upper ring of the dome, a 20-foot steel band that held up the equipment used to inflate the roof, according to FOX 2 Detroit.

The vertical beams surrounding the Silverdome were supposed to be broken when a small charge detonated, causing the steel ring to fall to the ground. That was not the case Sunday, and several beams remained.

Demolition company Adamo told the Detroit Free Press the blasts did weaken the Silverdome and it could still fall, but it's unclear when that might happen.

Rick Cuppetilli, the executive vice president at Adamo, told the newspaper that 10 percent of the explosive charges in eight key locations failed to detonate due to wiring issues that crews are investigating.

""Unless we find something in the next few hours researching the wiring, we will take it down mechanically,"" Cuppetilli said. ""We haven't found the wire yet. It's going to take us a while to research it all.""

The demolition team told FOX 2 there will not be any additional blasts Sunday, and that the weakened building could actually fall in on its own at some point.

The demolition of the iconic stadium is expected to involve crews using hydraulic excavators to take care of the rest of the structure in sections.

A total of 1,800 tons of rebar and 1,700 tons of structural steel are expected to be recycled at a city plant and take about a year to complete.

The Silverdome property sits on 127 acres and was last used as home of the Detroit Lions in 2001. The stadium, located about 30 miles north of Detroit, once hosted the Super Bowl, the Pistons, WrestleMania III, the World Cup and Pope John Paul II's visit.","Pontiac Silverdome, former home of the Detroit Lions, has failed partial implosion",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/12/03/pontiac-silverdome-former-home-detroit-lions-has-failed-partial-implosion.html

Two U.S. Navy aviators were placed on ""probationary"" status for six months, but were able to keep their wing insignia after appearing before disciplinary board for drawing lewd images in the sky with their aircraft earlier this month, according to a report.

NAVY ADMITS AIRCRAFT DREW LEWD IMAGES IN THE SKY

The San Diego Union-Tribune obtained the results of the Field Naval Aviator Evaluation Board hearing for the unidentified aviators: the pilot and his backseat aviator.

When two African-Americans parked their car at a Piggie Park drive-in in August 1964 in Columbia, South Carolina, the waitress who came out to serve them turned back once she saw they were black and didn't take their order.

In the civil rights lawsuit that followed, Piggie Park owner Maurice Bessinger justified the refusal to serve black customers based on his religious belief opposing ""any integration of the races whatsoever.""

Federal judges had little trouble dismissing Bessinger's claim.

""Undoubtedly defendant Bessinger has a constitutional right to espouse the religious beliefs of his own choosing, however, he does not have the absolute right to exercise and practice such beliefs in utter disregard of the clear constitutional rights of other citizens,"" U.S. District Judge Charles Earl Simons Jr. wrote in 1966.

By the time the Supreme Court heard the case in 1968, the issue was the award of fees to the lawyers representing the black South Carolinians who sued Bessinger's restaurants. But in a footnote to its unsigned 8-0 opinion, the court called the religious freedom argument and Bessinger's other defenses ""patently frivolous.""

Fifty years later, civil rights lawyers are pointing the Supreme Court to Bessinger's case in support of Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the gay couple who were turned away by Colorado baker Jack Phillips, giving rise to the high court case that will be argued Tuesday.

""The logic of Piggie Park and other precedents overwhelmingly rejecting religious justifications for racial discrimination apply squarely to the context of LGBTQ discrimination,"" the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said in a Supreme Court brief. The fund also represented the people who sued Piggie Park.

Both cases involve laws intended to prevent discrimination by private businesses that open their doors to the public. In the case of Piggie Park, the law was the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The bake shop case involves the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits businesses from refusing to sell their goods to people on the basis of sexual orientation among other things.

As the case has come to the justices, the focus is on Phillips' speech rights, not his religious beliefs. As a cake artist, he claims a right not to say something with which he disagrees.

Phillips' lawyers also say the baker's issue is not with gay people, but rather same-sex marriage. He will sell any pre-made goods to anyone who walks in the store, lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing Phillips, said. He also would make a cake celebrating ""a marriage between a man and a woman even if one or both spouses identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual,"" his lawyers wrote.

Laws that regulate speech, as Phillips' team asserts the Colorado anti-discrimination law does, often must withstand the toughest level of review that courts can apply, known as strict scrutiny. His lawyers rely on a 1995 unanimous Supreme Court decision allowing organizers of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston to exclude a gay rights group from the parade.

Speech restrictions rarely survive strict scrutiny at the Supreme Court.

But both Phillips and the Trump administration, which entered the case on Phillips' side, said speech restrictions aimed at race might be different.

A ruling for the baker would not call into question the use of public accommodations laws to prohibit racial discrimination, the administration said in its Supreme Court brief. ""As the court recently observed, 'racial bias' is 'a familiar and recurring evil' that poses 'unique historical, constitutional and institutional concerns,'"" the administration said, quoting from a decision this year in a case about racial discrimination among jurors.",Some see echoes of '68 court case in wedding cake dispute,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/03/some-see-echoes-68-court-case-in-wedding-cake-dispute.html

prev

It’s easy to overlook a mirror. After all, when we look at one, we see a reflection of so many other things before we even see the mirror itself. But a good mirror is an essential component to many rooms, especially your bathroom. There are many options for size, style and shape to choose from, so I’ve put together this guide to help you put things into perspective and get your bathroom mirror just right.

Sizing Your Mirror

When choosing the size of your mirror, you should consider not just function, but also proportion. To create a balanced look, think about the size of your mirror relative to that of your vanity.

Typically, vanity mirrors are not wider than the vanity itself, with some exceptions we will discuss a little later.

A common approach is to make the mirror exactly as wide as the vanity so the two line up perfectly.

Of course, this is much easier with a custom-sized mirror because you may not happen to find a pre-made mirror in the exact width of your vanity.

If they are not the same width, another solid approach is to make the mirror about 70 to 80 percent as wide as the vanity so the mirror appears a bit smaller, but not shrunken.

With respect to height, a functional mirror needs only to reach about a foot above and below the eye line of the people who will be using it. But the more height you can get, the better, because it will provide more viewing angles and a more open look to the space. Try to reach at least 4 to 7 feet above the floor.

Single vs. Multiple

If you have a wide vanity, especially one with multiple sinks, you have the option of using multiple mirrors or one single mirror wide enough to service both.

Using several tall and skinny mirrors can give a room a more vertical look, emphasizing the height of the space (especially effective when you have high ceilings). Of course, using a single large mirror opens up the room by reflecting more of the opposite walls. Ultimately the choice comes down to personal preference.

Using multiple mirrors can still work even when there is only one sink.

In fact, centering a mirror on the sink and then adding a second mirror symmetrical to the first can make the whole composition look more pleasingly balanced, compared with using just a single mirror.

Sconces

Another reason to use smaller mirrors is, of course, to allow some room for sconces to sit in between. Vanity light can be located in various places, but placing it to the sides of the mirror lights the face well, so it is both beautiful and functional.

When leaving room for sconces, choose a mirror that is closer to 60 to 70 percent of the width of the vanity (divided by the number of mirrors if you have more than one), so the sconces have room to sit above the vanity rather than hanging beyond the edges.

Wall-to-Wall Mirrors

For a different approach to sizing your mirror, you can ignore the size of the vanity on its own and instead use the mirror to fill the whole wall, often running above the toilet as well. This approach gives you a larger mirror, which can go a long way toward making a compact bathroom feel twice the size.

In this case, you can run the mirror literally wall-to-wall (and typically up to the ceiling) or extend it from one end of the vanity to the end of a nearby fixture.

In the latter case, though, it should still fill most of the wall to avoid looking like it’s simply the wrong size. And it should line up neatly with the objects below.

On one hand, having a custom-sized mirror cut to fit perfectly wall-to-wall is a higher investment than purchasing a prefab piece.

On the other hand, compared with running tile or stone behind or around a smaller mirror, it is often a relatively budget-friendly choice.

Depending on your budget and goals, it may make a lot of sense to use a custom-fitted mirror paired with a little splash of a splurge material below.

Framed vs. Frameless

Frameless mirrors are a popular choice in bathrooms for a few likely reasons. One is that they tend to be less expensive while often still quite stylish. A second is that they give modern appeal, and bathrooms even in somewhat traditional homes often run a bit more modern to achieve a clean, airy, “spa-like” look.

Frameless mirrors work most easily in contemporary or modern and minimalist spaces without a lot of busy decor. Mirrors with elaborate frames tend to suit traditional spaces where the other elements are also very detailed and decorative.

For a nice balance that can suit nearly any space, try a mirror with a simple frame that is a few inches wide and in a textural material that isn’t too busy.

For an eclectic sensibility, an ornate mirror can look magnificent as a statement piece in a modern bathroom.

Getting the mix just right will take a good design eye, but the unique result will bring a lot of personality and drama to the room.

Inset Mirrors

A clever way to get the modern look of a frameless mirror and the sense of polish of a framed mirror is to inset the mirror into tile so it’s essentially framed by the surrounding material.

Layering floating shelves over the top gives extra additional modern flair and some useful storage.

Round Mirrors

We’ve mostly looked at simple rectangular mirrors so far, but of course there are many other shapes.

Round mirrors can be a great way to bring some softness and relaxed appeal to a bathroom, which often has a lot of hard surfaces and crisp lines.

Round mirrors are a great companion to pedestal sinks, as they often have curved lines themselves.

Round mirrors generally leave more negative space at the “corners” than a rectangular mirror would, which makes sense because pedestal sinks leave some negative space around the pedestal base.

A round mirror is also a great choice if you have an interesting wall finish to show off. It gives you enough mirror to see your face, but it leaves a bit more wall exposed, and the curved lines will pick up the organic shapes in a leafy or floral print.

Medicine Cabinets

Sure, all of the previous mirrors were attractive, but what if you need some serious storage space?

Medicine cabinet mirrors are best when inset into the wall — that way they won’t be so in-your-face. A professional can guide you during a site visit as to whether your wall cavity can house some inset or partially inset cabinets.

Otherwise, try using a few tricks to avoid letting that cabinet visually shrink the room.

A cabinet with little or no frame will avoid feeling in-your-face, while adding some under-cabinet lighting (just as you might in a kitchen) will bring a glow that cancels out any dark shadows and makes the whole sink area feel more open.

Suspended Mirrors

If you have an unusual bathroom layout or an inconveniently placed window or obstacle, don’t forget that mirrors don’t absolutely have to hang flat on a wall.

Suspending a mirror from the ceiling or a window frame, or mounting it on rails rising from the counter, can allow you to place a mirror in a new, functional spot.

Donna Brazile, former Chair of Democratic National Committee (DNC) joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss her book ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House"".

Brazile explained how the book was designed as an autopsy on why the Democrat party lost the 2016 election, the same way the Republicans looked at the reasons why they lost after the 2012 election. Brazile also went into detail on the DNC becoming part of the Clinton campaign instead of being an independent arbitrator and remaining neutral and working to elect democrats across the country during the 2016 election. When asked about the differences of opinion on campaign tactics with Robby Mook, Brazile said she felt the Clinton camping should have combined the modern analytical approach with the classic ground game approach of meeting and greeting people across the country. Plus, Brazile discussed reaching out to Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer after the DNC email hacking and being unable to get President Obama to think about the DNC and Democrat party's long term future after he leaves office.

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX RADIO HOST: Joining us right now is Donna Brazille, author of the best----selling book --well, the book is fantastic. It's called --it's called ""Hacks"", and she is now out with the book that I think that a lot of people took the excerpts and said this is a good book, it's explosive. It's even better if you actually read it, which by the way, I did. Donna, welcome.

DONNA BRAZILLE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: Thank you so much. Good to talk to you. How was your Thanksgiving?

KILMEADE: Great, Donna. Were you able to relax, kick back, and enjoy it, or were you thinking about your book tour?

BRAZILLE: Well I got off my book tour and I made it back home, and had a chance to go to the grocery store and make some gumbo, so I was really happy to just unwind, and to celebrate the season with so many great friends.

KILMEADE: So I've only met you --I've interviewed you a couple of times, but you mostly work for CNN. But the thing I like most about you is it doesn't matter your point of view, you don't look --you don't hate people because they disagree with you. That era seems to have gone by the boards. (ph) The hatred flying around is, I tell you, it's really --it's numbing.

BRAZILLE: Well you know, I was --I was born at a time when it was very important to forge a compromise, and to really listen to people who might have a different opinion. I'm happy to call --I got so many friends, both you know, media folks, journalists, but also, you know, political leaders.

I used to tell people that when I was back on Capitol Hill as a staffer, whenever Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott the former speaker, the former majority leader in the Senate, and Bill Clinton, the former president, whenever they would sit down, I would --I would go in the room and try to translate, because one was from Mississippi, the other one's from Georgia, and of course Bill Clinton from Arkansas. I'm from Louisiana. I believe that it --the best thing that we can do as a country is to find ways to --

KILMEADE: Right.

BRAZILLE: -- come together. And I still believe it. In fact my --over Thanksgiving, we didn't talk politics of course, we talked football. I got good news and bad news. The good news is Auburn beat Alabama. The bad news is that the Saints lost to the Rams. So that's what we do. We sit around, we eat, we drink, we talk --we talk sports --

KILMEADE: Got you.

BRAZILLE: We talk about family. We don't --we don't get into arguing over each other over President Trump, anyone else.

KILMEADE: Well what's there to argue about President Trump? It's pretty much the same old thing.

BRAZILLE: True.

KILMEADE: Donna, looking at chapter four of the book, it really talks about what you've walked into. You went out to save the party using your immense experience and contacts to go back and try to get --to make sure that Hillary Clinton was the next president.

You open up your book saying how you never got the call. When you did get the call, it was a cold call from Hillary Clinton, cold in the way it wasn't cold, it was cold in the way her demeanor, it wasn't like thanks for all your help. It was basically almost as if, in my intention, when I picked up the intro was, I kind of blame you guys for not helping me enough.

But the real telling of this book was the numbers in chapter four. When you took over the campaign, Hillary Clinton's campaign, taking a look at the books, President Obama left the party $24 million in debt, $15 million bank debt, and more than $8 million owed to vendors from 2012.

Hillary for America and their victory fund picked up, took care of 80 percent of that. Now she wanted something in return, and in return she got the loyalty and control of the DNC. Is that correct?

BRAZILLE: Yes, she put --the campaign put the Democratic National Committee on, I call it a starvation diet, by essentially helping to pay down the debt. And of course President Obama went out there every day along with Joe Biden, Michelle Obama and many others to pay down that debt.

But the DNC effectively became part of the Clinton campaign as opposed to the DNC being an independent arbiter of the primary process. That concerned me, and that's one of the reasons why I think many people read the excerpts and said oh my gosh, she said something. No, I was saying that --

KILMEADE: It's facts.

BRAZILLE: -- as a member of the party. The party should have remained neutral in terms of not having anyone take over those functions. Now I found no evidence whatsoever that in taking over those three departments it played any role whatsoever in the primary.

But still when I --when I became Al Gore's campaign manager in 1999, I stepped aside as the quote----unquote co----chair of the rules and bylaws committee. I stepped aside. So it's important you step aside and not inject yourself into the primary process.

KILMEADE: You talk about three egos, Debbie Wasserman----Schultz, President Obama, and President --and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, all pushing their own direction, not caring enough about the party. In the case of Barack Obama who you obviously like and were thrilled that he got two terms, you feel as though he didn't come up in the party.

So he didn't have the loyalty of past people, maybe like Joe Biden would have. So he was actually --and 2014, the President Obama wanted to draw on the party's $10 million line of credit. Here he is, he's done, he's makes some money.

Every time he speaks he makes millions of dollars, but it was all for the Obama superpac. It wasn't for the DNC. Why were you unable to get through to them that he had to think about the party, not just himself?

BRAZILLE: Well I tried, and I was the last officer who refused to sign the loan papers until I had a guarantee that they would help us pay it back. What worried me was that he took out the --authorized us to take out the loan for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Look, he wanted to win in 2014, but by giving them, you know --you know, that much money in the closing weeks of the campaign, I felt like it wasn't the best use of our resources when we should have given it directly to the state parties, and the candidates themselves. But you know, those decisions were made. I went along at the end because I didn't want to do anything to threaten the ability to win that fall.

KILMEADE: So they did not, in my opinion, they didn't respect you. They didn't understand that you still had to touch people, meet people, put the lawn signs on, and when the --when the cutting edge --I guess this generation, Robby Mook and Brian Fallon and company, well he was more of a spokesperson, decide to put together a campaign, they're looking at bar graphs and analytics.

And you're saying where are the --you've got to get on the ground. But yet it's almost as if you were screaming and people were diminishing you and who you were. And that burns you up, right?

BRAZILLE: Well look, I like politics, I love my country, I have traveled this country, I've said in the book I worked on so many campaigns in my adult life that I know the country by zip code, by county. I love the American people.

And when you get out there and the first thing people say to you, Madam Chair, we need some yard signs, we need some posters, we need some activity, well my inclination is to give it to them. Robbie look, I applaud, you know, the modern----day campaigns, using analytics and many of the things that I didn't use. I used 3x5 cards, I still have a photographic memory.

But I thought we could have done both. We could have had a ground operation that was responsive to the needs of the people who wanted information, as well as the literature, et cetera, as well as doing the analytics.

But look, I was concerned throughout the entire time about the hacking. The reason why I wrote the book is because the country was under attack.

KILMEADE: Yes.

BRAZILLE: And I felt like that would get lost, and it did get lost even in the release of my book, because nobody's really dealing with what happened in 2016 in terms of the hacking. What worries me going forward is within the next four months we're going to start having primary elections for the midterm campaign, and we're still no better off today than we were back in 2016. That should worry every American.

KILMEADE: Yes, and by the way, Italy is all nervous about their elections, if the Russians are going to play a role, and reaching out to Facebook to calm down --to let them know who's buying ads and why. That's how paranoid they are.

Here is a list of some --when you write this book, Donna, and you blast your own party, you tell people what the truth was behind the scenes, without an agenda. I didn't see you patting yourself on the back here. You're saying this is what I tried to do, and this is what they told me. So here's some of what they're saying about your book, cut 27 (ph), here's Robby Mook.

ROBBY MOOK, 2016 CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The idea that the DNC could rig a contest frankly is laughable. The allegation she's making there simply isn't true. We don't --certainly don't recognize the campaign she describes. We also don't recall some of the events she said that happened. I'm sure her publisher put her under a lot of pressure. I wish she'd just put her foot down and said I'm not going to do this.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

KILMEADE: Did the publisher put you under pressure?

BRAZILLE: No. I mean you know, look, as I mentioned, I have been active in politics since the age of nine. In two years I will celebrate my 50th anniversary in working on campaigns, 7 presidential, 56 state and local campaigns, 19 campaigns at the state and local level.

Look, if there's one thing I know in life that's campaigns. I know all about American politics. Look, I respect them. Robby and all of the others had an opportunity when the campaign was over to write their book, to do a post mortem, to do an autopsy. The Republicans did an autopsy after 2012.

When the campaign manager of your leading candidate decides not to do that, well guess what, the chair, someone who's been actively involved, saw everything up close and personal, it was my job to write the autopsy.

KILMEADE: Wow.

BRAZILLE: This is my version. He can write his own autopsy. I wish everybody the best, but read my book because I do believe that the American people will come away knowing a little bit more about hacking, what happened, the mistakes, the fumbling, you know, things that I had to deal with in real time. I didn't try to exaggerate anything other than

KILMEADE: But he says he hasn't read ----

BRAZILLE: -- the fact that I wanted people to know what happened.

KILMEADE: Donna, I don't mean to cut you off there, because unlike a lot of people you were working with, I do respect what you say. But Robby, he's basically saying he doesn't recognize the campaign that you're describing, and he also --you also just said something I didn't know. They have no interest in an autopsy, what went wrong? They just seem to want to --it seems to me publicly they just want to blame the Russians.

BRAZILLE: Well that --and look --

KILMEADE: So are you saying they never went back and did even what Reince Priebus did after Mitt Romney lost?

BRAZILLE: I requested that. You know, right after the campaign, I had to stick around. I didn't leave until the end of February. I went to Phoenix, Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta. I wanted to hear from the American people. I made the decision.

I wasn't the campaign manager, I was the chair of the Democratic National Committee. I didn't work for Robby Mook. In fact when I was --I didn't get a salary, so I was a volunteer. I gave up my time, my life, my resources to help elect Hillary Clinton and Democrats up and down the ballot.

So I don't --I don't report to Robby Mook or anyone else. I wanted the American people to get a sense of what happened to the Democratic National Committee. We are the --we are the oldest political party in the country. Next year we celebrate our 170th anniversary.

During the entire time I was reaching out to Priebus. You know, every time we learned that the Russians were still trying to hack into our system, I reached out. In the book I talk about reaching out to Sean Spicer, I talked about reaching out to Reince Priebus.

This wasn't just a Democratic Party attempt to fight the Russians and the hacking, but also ----

KILMEADE: Yes.

BRAZILLE: -- it was --I tried to get bipartisan support. Because the only way you're going to deal with any form of hacking, whether it's from the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans --

KILMEADE: No, I hear you, Donna.

BRAZILLE: -- anyone else, you have to be able to reach out and try to win this together.

KILMEADE: Right. Now listen, Donna, the way that call was cold to you in February, that's one of the reasons why you made sure to write the book, and have you --and Hillary Clinton's book promotion seems to be a promotion of making excuses and talking about the Russians.

Are you disappointed in Hillary Clinton's lack of contrition, that Al Gore said OK, I lost? That was a much closer election than this one, so are you disappointed the way she's acted?

BRAZILLE: You know, she's busy, she has her own agenda, which I respect. I've known her for over three decades. I've never been in the inner, inner circle of the Clinton world, or the Clinton campaign, or the Clinton Foundation or anything else.

But I've always been supportive. I spent most of my adult career trying to promote, you know, the right to vote, and therefore I'm not into, you know, candidates or campaign worshiping. I respect the right that she can move forward with her life.

I read her book, I thought it was great. She mentioned a lot of things that I mentioned in my book, but more importantly, as the chair of the campaign, I had to describe what impact it had on the party and the country.

KILMEADE: I have about 100 more questions for you, but unfortunately we're up against the clock. I hope to see you again in studio.

BRAZILLE: We need to call -- I need to do it again.

KILMEADE: Yes, let's do it.

BRAZILLE: I want to do it again.

KILMEADE: All right, so let's hold on to that number, all right? And we're not going to give that to anybody, especially the Russians.

BRAZILLE: Well please don't. They already have it. The Chinese too, I've been hacked by both. Well look, I just want to tell all your listeners, God bless you all, may your holiday season, Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, whatever it may be, may you celebrate it with joy, and with friendship and laughter.

The woman who hit the animal knew she hit something after leaving her house in Gloucester County in eastern Virginia. She found out what it was an hour later when she reached her job at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.

And the truth was trampled on a Phoenix tarmac.","In Washington, the ostensible story is rarely the real story. We know, for example, that former President Clinton engineered a meeting with President Obama’s attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on the tarmac of the Phoenix Airport on June 27, 2016.

That’s the official story, replete with the charming and intentionally disarming detail that all they talked about was their grandchildren. It was just coincidental, don’t you know, that at the time the FBI was looking into Hillary Clinton’s use of a “personal” email server to send, receive and store classified information.

And it was also simply coincidental that just a few days later, the director of the FBI – who served under Attorney General Lynch – announced that he wouldn’t recommend a prosecution of Hillary Clinton.

Richard Nixon must be rolling over in his grave.

What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting.

What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting. In fact, the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous meeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton – but rather on one of the whistleblowers who got the word out.

The organization I head, Judicial Watch, asked the FBI on July 7, 2016, for any records that might pertain to the infamous tarmac meeting. We had to sue after we were ignored by the agency.

Then the FBI told us flat-out that it couldn’t find any records. And we now know that was flat-out untrue. Because, in responding to another one of our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, the Justice Department gave us heavily redacted documents that showed there were additional documents tucked away at the FBI headquarters.

If not for Judicial Watch's lawsuits these documents would still be hidden today.

Because of the revelation in our other lawsuit, the FBI – without our knowledge—""reopened"" our FOIA request. The agency supposedly found about 30 pages of information, which it needed six weeks to review. The FBI finally gave them to us late Thursday.

Now we know why the FBI played shell games. The documents show that FBI officials were concerned solely about the leaking of details of the tarmac meeting. None of the documents show top agency officials cared one whit about the propriety of the meeting itself, but only about who blew the whistle on the covert tête-à-tête.

In one email, an FBI official writes “we need to find that guy.” And in another we learn that the Phoenix FBI office was contacted “in an attempt to stem any further damage.” An FBI official working on Lynch’s security detail even goes so far as to suggest non-disclosure agreements to keep the full facts from coming forth.

Emergency medical personnel administered chest compressions before Solomon was transported off the court on a stretcher.

Solomon collapsed near the bench at the 13:08 mark of the game, causing the arena to fall silent. Cries rang out from people around the Bulldogs' bench as staff members fanned Solomon with a jacket.

Solomon, a 5-foot-10 senior guard, started the game and checked out at the 16:02 mark.

On Wednesday, 36-year-old William Rancourt was shot when a hunting dog stepped on the trigger of a shotgun lying on the ground nearly 22 yards away from the man, causing the gun to fire, a news release from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources reports.

The man was transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries, the report continues.

“Shotguns are extremely dangerous at close range,"" Ken Lonneman, a DNR conversation officer, told the Des Moines Register. ""In this case, there was a good distance between the muzzle and the wound, but if the victim had been closer, his injuries would have been more severe.""

When Rancourt arrived at the hospital, he was alert and able to walk. X-rays were being performed Wednesday afternoon to ensure all pellets had been removed from Rancourts back, the Des Moines Register reported.

The New Hampshire resident had been hunting with his party in Wright County, Iowa. The group, which included two dogs, two Iowans and another man from New Hampshire, had been pheasant hunting around 1:20 p.m. when one of the men placed his loaded shotgun on the ground.

Rancourt’s injuries were “fairly moderate,” Lonneman said, but he hopes the incident serves as a reminder to all hunters to unload their guns and place the safety on before placing them down or leaving them unattended.

They didn’t think anything of it, but soon the sound of sirens filled the neighborhood.

Their neighbor had walked out to the back patio and shot herself.

As the woman was taking her final steps to her back door, other families in the neighborhood were opening presents, baking desserts for Christmas dinner and listening to holiday music. But something told this hurting woman she would be better off dead than to live through the remaining hours of Christmas Day.

The thought of her Christmas death haunts me – how isolated she must have felt, how desperate for relief. But though she might not have realized it, in those other houses down the street other people could relate.

Someone was baking a pie and fighting back tears in a losing battle against depression. Another person was so anxious she could hardly breathe while cleaning up the wrapping paper. Someone else was facing his first Christmas without a loved one. And while those people did not commit suicide, I'm sure many felt like they were dying inside.

Immanuel is in the shame with you.

Immanuel came so he could lie down in the dirty manger of your circumstances and simply be there with you.

Immanuel will provide comfort through his Spirit, and he will also give you the strength to reach out for help from loved ones, support groups, counselors or even a crisis hotline. Receive that strength today. Experience his presence through the people he will use to help you get through this unbearable time.

The Detroit automaker made the announcement at an investor presentation in San Francisco Thursday, saying that based on its current rate of change, it expects ""commercial launch at scale"" of the autonomous vehicles within the next year or so. The vehicles would not have a human backup driver, the company said.

Company executives didn't say how many vehicles GM would deploy or what cities they would be in, but they were clear that the company plans to run ride-hailing and delivery services and quickly make money off them — at higher profit margins than it now makes from selling cars and trucks.

""This business is potentially bigger than our current core business,"" Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told the group.

GM said it is important to be first to get the self-driving electric vehicles on the road so the rider experience can be improved quickly and give the company a competitive advantage. GM said there still was much more difficult engineering work to do. And it's not quite clear yet whether the automaker will be first.

Delphi, an automotive supplier, has said it expects commercial vehicles to be using its autonomous system in limited areas in 2019. Delphi recently bought autonomous software startup NuTonomy and is also partnering with BMW AG, chipmaker Intel Corp. and camera and visual recognition software maker Mobileye.

Google's Waymo division is testing self-driving minivans in Phoenix, carrying passengers without a backup driver in the front seat. An employee in the back will be able to stop the vehicle by pushing a button but won't be able to steer the vehicle. Waymo plans to announce a commercial service in the next few months.

German automaker Daimler AG has teamed up with supplier Bosch to develop autonomous taxis by 2020. And Ford plans to have a self-driving car available for ride-hailing services by 2021.

GM President Dan Ammann said the first commercial use of EVs would be in ride-sharing. He wouldn't say if the service would involve ride-hailing company Lyft, in which GM has invested $500 million. More details, he said, would come closer to 2019.

GM's Cruise Automation unit is testing autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles with human backup drivers in San Francisco, Detroit and Phoenix, and has plans to test in Manhattan next year.

The automaker says it's focused on deploying self-driving vehicles safely, but it also wants to beat rivals to market. Ammann said GM is in the lead to deploy the vehicles in large numbers. Once they're on the road, the vehicles' computers will constantly learn and improve.

""Getting first onto that learning curve is pretty important,"" he said.

GM estimated the total ride-sharing market could reach $1.6 trillion once it hits 75 percent of all rides in the U.S. Now it's less than 1 percent. Ammann said GM now makes about $30,000 per vehicle by selling them, but said ride-hailing and delivery profits could rise to hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle.

Because GM has software and sensor development, as well as manufacturing, it can roll out autonomous vehicles cheaper than competitors, the company said.

According to the Government of Accountability Office (GAO) report, which was released on Monday, the VA is required to report providers to a national database designed to prevent them from crossing state lines and endangering other patients. However, based on a sampling of 148 providers at five unidentified VA hospitals who required review, officials had only reported nine health care workers since 2014, and none had been reported to state licensing boards.

The GAO noted that much of the failed reporting came as a result of confusion about VA policies and responsibilities, as well as months or years-long delays in the review process. For instance, in cases involving 16 providers, the process was not started until after more than three months had passed.

Service chiefs were not made aware of the reviews for up to 13 months after the incidents, during which three of the providers had an additional “concerning episode of care.” The report also noted a lack of knowledge regarding required documentation of medical care.

“At one facility, we found that officials failed to report six providers to the (national database) because the officials were unaware that they had been delegated responsibility for … reporting,” the GAO said.

One case involved a doctor who resigned while under review for misconduct, but was not reported to a state licensing board. The doctor was later hired at a non-VA facility within the same state, only to be disciplined for the same unreported misconduct that had prompted the initial review.

A hearing on the GAO findings lead by the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, while the VA has pledged to increase oversight of reporting by regional officials.

President Trump on Monday revived his favorite nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- “Pocahontas” -- during a White House event to honor Navajo code talkers.

The president hosted the event to honor the veterans who used their native language during World Wars I and II to protect the U.S. during battle.

“You’re very, very special people. You were here long before any of us were here,” Trump said in the Oval Office. But his comments took an unexpected turn—to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts.

“Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas,” Trump said. “But you know what? I like you. Because you are special.”

That’s right, the entire nation of New Zealand is totally owning the Christmas spirit by hosting a nationwide Secret Santa program that is guaranteed to bring joy to everyone involved.

More than 3,600 people in the country have signed up to take part in the national gift exchange, according to the Secret Santa program, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

This marks the seventh year of the program, which was started in 2010 by a guy named Sam (just Sam, no last name), who simply put out a call on Twitter asking if his fellow citizens would like to take part in a gift exchange. The program became so popular that the government took notice and made it a state-sponsored event.

The rules of the exchange are fairly simple. As the site states, participants must first use #nzsecretsanta to tweet and @nzsecretsanta to talk to the elves running the show. Next, they must link their Twitter account to a New Zealand Post online account. Next to-do is to spend a little time following the matched giftee to find out what they like, and then buy or make an awesome gift for about $10.

Participants are supposed to send their gift as soon as possible so the elves can get to work, and then all they have to do is wait for their own gift to arrive (and tweet a photo of it to share the joy with the world).

If you don’t live in New Zealand but still want to participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange, you can join Reddit’s worldwide gift program. Each year thousands of people, including Bill Gates, sign up to exchange gifts with total strangers they’ve never met. It sounds crazy, but it truly does encapsulate what the holidays really are all about: spreading joy.

Employees at Cash’s Liquor Store in Fort Walton Beach went back to work the day after Thanksgiving and discovered a strange sight: an opossum next to a broken and empty bottle of bourbon.

Owner Cash Moore told Northwest Florida Daily News this was the first time he’s experienced an opossum break-in at his business.

""She came in from the outside and was up in the rafters, and when she came through she knocked a bottle of liquor off the shelf,"" Moore told Northwest Florida Daily. ""When she got down on the floor she drank the whole damn bottle.”

Michelle Pettis, a technician at Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge, said the female opossum, who was brought in by a police officer, appeared pale and disoriented and was salivating excessively.

“A worker there found the opossum up on a shelf next to a cracked open bottle of liquor with nothing in it,” Pettis told the newspaper. “Assuming the opossum drank it all, he brought her to us, and we looked over her and she definitely wasn’t fully acting normal.”

The staff pumped the marsupial with fluids to flush out the alcohol in her system. She sobered up in a few days and was released on Thursday unharmed.

The opossum also appeared to have escaped a dreadful hangover, according to Pettis.

It’s still unclear how the animale broke into Cash’s. Pettis described the animal as “fairly large.”

The refuge center posted on its Facebook page Friday a photo of the opossum with the caption: “On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: a drunk opossum in a box! This sly, and currently slurred, opossum snuck its way into a liquor store and discovered some holiday cheer of its own. A police officer brought the animal to us for medical treatment and is expected to be released soon.”

The post received hundreds of reactions and shares.

Democrats have a lot to say about the Republican tax-reform plan, including that it is a “middle class con job” and is going to cost the GOP its congressional majorities. That’s quite the bold claim, coming from the party that is in fact in uncharted tax-politics territory.

Americans have short political memories, which means it is no longer possible to remember a world in which Democrats didn’t hate tax cuts. And in the mainstream media—which shares the left’s penchant for class warfare—it’s also no longer possible to read an analysis that doesn’t assume Democrats are on the right side of history, that these tax cuts are “unpopular,” and that this reform holds grave political risks for Republicans.

Based on what? Democrats certainly have no modern evidence of these propositions, since they’ve never uniformly opposed tax cuts. In fact, it’s been 16 years since the party even engaged in a big tax brawl, during George W. Bush’s first year as president. What’s striking is just how many Democrats enthusiastically signed on to Mr. Bush’s tax bill, and just how far off the political rails the party has gone in the intervening years.

While the Bush tax package was hardly as sweeping as today’s reform, it contained similar provisions. It cut marginal rates across the board, even knocking nearly 5 points off the top marginal rate for the 1 percent. It cut capital-gains taxes and lowered the estate tax to zero in 2010, before the reductions expired. These are all cuts that House and Senate Democrats today uniformly decry as giveaways to the rich and powerful.

""He was down by a creek, so it was nice and loud,"" said Bowser. ""I was able to sneak up on him.""

Bowser said when the bear first turned around and look at him, his initial reaction was: “Whoa!”

The gargantuan animal was not an easy one to take down, though. It took four shots before Bowser succeeded. Then he had to figure out how to get the bear out of the forest.

""If we had shot him anywhere deep in the woods, we wouldn't have been able to get him out,"" said Bowser.

Bowser floated the bear across the creek and then had his friends and dad pitch in to load the animal onto his ATV.

""Five guys, 45 minutes to drag it 15 yards,"" he said to the news outlet.

Bowser said he doesn’t expect to get such a large trophy next year – just shy of the largest kill of the hunting season, which was 700 pounds according to the Pennsylvania Game Commission.

""I mean, I'll never shoot a 600-pounder again,"" he said. ""But, like I said, sometimes luck is on your side.""

FOX NEWS - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un ordered his engineers on Tuesday to launch the country’s new intercontinental ballistic missile with ""courage"" a day ahead of the flight test where it demonstrated its reach deep into the U.S. mainland.

North Korea’s state television said that the nuclear-capable intercontinental-ballistic missile that was launched earlier is “significantly more” powerful than the previous weapon and puts the entire United States in its crosshairs.

The report called the weapon a Hwasong 15. The launch was detected after it was fired early Wednesday morning from a site near Pyongyang.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, which first reported the launch, said the missile launch happened around 3 a.m. local time in North Korea. South Korea fired pinpoint missiles into nearby waters to make sure North Korea understands it can be ""taken under fire"" by the South, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said.

The South Korean military said that the missile was fired from an area near Pyongyang. It reached a height of 2,796 miles and traveled 596 miles, demonstrating the potential to reach a range of 8,100 miles. David Wright, a U.S. physicist who has studied North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, said that this would put any part of the U.S. comfortably within reach of a North Korean missile strike.

One factor that could significantly affect the missile’s range is the payload. If, as expected, it carried a light mock warhead, then its effective range would have been shorter, analyst said.

Yet for as long as the protests remain, the self-imposed NFL boycott will, too.","Restaurants across the country are in full swing every Sunday dishing out classic American fare during football games. Just don't expect to actually watch those games at some establishments.

“I’m never going to go back on it as long as they are going to protest,” David McCraw, the owner of the Palmetto Restaurant and Ale House in Greenville, South Carolina, told Fox News. He is one of a series of restaurant owners who have vowed to keep NFL games off their televisions amid the ongoing controversy involving players who kneel during the national anthem.

Instead, gridiron action is being replaced with basketball, ""The Walking Dead"" and even pictures of American soldiers – and that may not change for a while.

The businesses say the move has had mixed results so far as the NFL regular season – more than halfway over -- heats uip amid the race for the playoffs.

One owner said he has had to fight fake Yelp reviews. Several proprietors have been slammed on social media. And at least one has “gotten a couple death threat calls.”

“We still do not show NFL games or anything else that shows NFL at all,” Matthew Wolcott, owner of Baxters Family Food & Fun in Hixson, Tennessee – just outside Chattanooga -- tells Fox News.

Wolcott says channels like ESPN are among those that are off limits at his family-friendly establishment, and even though some people have stopped coming, there are “patriots” in the area that agree with his views and veterans stop by each weekend.

“It’s never been about a race thing for us. It never will be. It was simply about the respect that those in the armed forces deserve,” he told Fox News. “It’s just us standing up for what we believe in just like everyone else stands up for what they believe.”

Wolcott says he has received threatening calls since announcing on Facebook that Baxters would not show the league’s games “until the NFL comes to its senses on this national anthem tragedy.”

Instead, his restaurant’s televisions are showing pictures of American soldiers during NFL games. Wolcott told Fox News that he comes from a military family and his grandfather, Charles Robert Pickle, was a Marine who fought in the Korean War and was part of the Frozen Chosen.

At Canyon Road Bar & Grill in Breckenridge, Texas, owner Kent Thompson told Fox News that there have been no ""measurable negative impacts” from not showing Thursday night NFL games.

In South Carolina, McCraw says the foot traffic through the doors of the Palmetto Restaurant and Ale House on Sundays and Monday nights has dropped, but numbers overall are up from last year.

“It’s just a position I took and I’m willing to stand by it,” he said, adding that he issue he has with the protests is with the timing.

“A lot of people got it twisted,” he told Fox News over the debate surrounding the protests. McCraw says he believes there are social disadvantages in society for minorities in general, and that the country needs “to work on those issues”, but there is a “better time to bring it to light"" than the national anthem protests.

“I would support them on any issue if they wanted to protest, but not during the national anthem,” he added.

The timing has been a point of debate for supporters and opponents of the kneeling, which has spread to other sports.

Bruce Maxwell, an Oakland Athletics catcher who in September became the first to kneel in baseball, said he believes the U.S. is the “best country on the planet,” but he is kneeling “for the people that don’t have a voice.

“This goes beyond the black community. This goes beyond the Hispanic community,” he said. “Because right now we are having a racial divide in all types of people.”

NBA superstar LeBron James has told reporters that the protests are ""about equality,” not about disrespecting the American flag or military. And Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers QB who has become a lightning rod of controversy after starting the protest movement, says it’s “bigger than football.

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told the NFL in 2016.

Yet for as long as the protests remain, the self-imposed NFL boycott will, too.

All of the restaurants interviewed by Fox News for this article also said they aren’t planning to show the Super Bowl in February.

“All they are doing is driving people out of the living room, it’s amazing they don’t get that,” Thompson said about the demonstrating NFL players.",Some restaurants steadfast in NFL boycott over anthem kneelers,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/11/30/some-restaurants-steadfast-in-nfl-boycott-over-anthem-kneelers.html

The birth of a baby is a momentous occasion for any family, but for one disabled veteran and his fiancé where and how their daughter was born has made it all the more special. Last Tuesday, Marcus Nash and Charlie White were just steps outside of their front door and on their way to the hospital when White was overcome with pain, Fox 5 Atlanta reported.

“When that last pain hit I just knew it was time, and I couldn’t stop it,” White told the news outlet.

Nash, who has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), quickly guided White to nearby cement and sprang into action.

“I laid her down right here,” Nash told the news outlet, pointing to the sidewalk. “The baby was coming out.”

With the help of two neighbors, Nash coached White through the delivery of Marlee Jane while waiting for an ambulance crew to arrive. Cardena Williamson and Bri Anderson provided blankets and towels to White and the baby.

In addition to the La Nina, an occasional cooling of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that affects global weather and leaves the nation's midsection drier than normal in winter, a wet spring led to heavy growth of vegetation that a mild summer didn't kill off. A dry November increased drought conditions in states including Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Texas, said Oklahoma's state climatologist, Gary McManus.

McManus compared the potential scenario to that in March, when wildfires in northwestern Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle scorched a total of more than 2,000 square miles (5180 sq. kilometers) left six people dead and killed thousands of head of livestock.

""What we see is this La Nina pattern, a cooling of the waters off the coast of South America, and what this means is above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation,"" most likely from December through February or early March, he said, adding that precipitation won't help dormant vegetation at this point.

""Even if we get rain and snow right now, it won't turn anything green,"" McManus said, noting that drought in the region is spreading and intensifying.

The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map, released Thursday, shows extreme drought conditions in more than a dozen counties in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma, where none existed a week earlier. Much of the remainder of the western half of Arkansas is in severe drought, as is southeastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, in addition to northern Louisiana and parts of southern Missouri.

""We are kind of seeing the epicenter of this drought originate in western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma and moving westward,"" potentially as far as New Mexico, according to Todd Lindley, science and operations officer at the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma.

In western Arkansas, fires in the Ouachita and the Ozark national forests began last week and burned a total of about 4 1/2 square miles (11 1/2 sq. kilometers), according to Tracy Farley, a spokeswoman for the two forests.

""It's dramatically dry earlier in the season,"" which typically would not begin experiencing such weather until January, Lindley said.

He said it's very similar to the weather pattern last year that created the conditions for the large wildfires that began March 6 in northwestern Oklahoma because of downed power lines and eventually burned for more than a week, charring more than 1,200 square miles (3,100 sq. kilometers) in Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas.

Stanley Barby, who owns Bar B Ranch near Beaver in the Oklahoma Panhandle, said the fires burned 33,000 acres (13,355 hectares) of his 50,000-acre (20235-hectare) ranch. He said the ranch is still recovering from the loss of pastures, fences, barns, three houses and some cattle, and that there is no way to prepare for such an event — just hope it doesn't happen again.

""Mother Nature controls it, you just take it one day at a time, that's just a part of being a rancher and a farmer ... we just accept it,"" Barby said, ""We just pray for a break, 'Mother Nature give us a break,' that's all we can do.""

The potential of a large wildfire outbreak is scary, said Mark Goeller, state fire management chief of Oklahoma Forestry Services.

""We've been really watching closely for the past two months,"" Goeller said. ""We are just in a preparedness mode. I've been in contact with other states on the availability of crews"" and with the U.S. Forest Service about the availability of aircraft.

But fires begin in multiple states, he said, those resources will be difficult to obtain for every state involved.

""It will start to be tough, because other states as they start to experience fire occurrences, then bringing people from (other states) will be harder and harder,"" Goeller said.

Also, some states have reported drones flying above wildfires as aircraft attempt to drop water on the flames or are searching for or monitoring fires.

In Arkansas last week, a drone above a fire in northern Arkansas forced an aircraft that was monitoring the flames to divert.

Firefighting agencies will reroute or ground aircraft if a drone is seen because a collision with the device could cause the aircraft to crash.","La Nina contributes to wildfire threat in mid-South, Plains",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/03/la-nina-contributes-to-wildfire-threat-in-mid-south-plains.html

A Timbersled modified bike will excel not just on hard-pack and trails, but also deep snow in the most remote terrains.

Timbersleds for winter warfare

For military special operations, the potential is wide-ranging for winter warfare.

Timbersleds mean that all the same advantages bikes can provide in other terrains can now be leveraged in snow-covered environments.

They could be used for anything from surveillance, reconnaissance and discreetly gathering intelligence. They could also be harnessed by teams jumping into enemy terrain who use the Timbersleds to race towards a target and launch an unexpected attack.

The flexibility they provide is a key advantage. For example, Timbersleds could mean units are not limited to roads and therefore can take entirely unanticipated routes through tough mountainous and winter wooded terrain.

This is an exciting technology for special operations, but it is also available to civilians now too. Check out Timbersleds in action in Iceland.

So how does it work?

The Timbersled systems include a front ski and a rear track system. These replace the bike tires.

The kits are motorcycle specific and the installation is very straightforward. Within less than an hour some Timbersleds can be installed. Others take under three hours.

FUTURISTIC BIONIC ARMS NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE NATION'S BRAVEST

Timbersleds are compatible with a wide range of dirt bikes and motocross from the past 25 years.

There are four new Timbersled options for 2018: they are all designed to be tough and robust, while incorporating different special advantages. You can see the Timbersled in action – dirt versus snow – here.

Mission requires anything and everything

For a winter warfare mission that may require anything and everything, the Timbersled ARO 120 could be a great choice. Whether powder or steep side hill, the converted dirt bike will have no problem.

Designed as an all-rounder, it will also feel and perform like your dirt bike does - but with snow.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

The design has accelerated the track speed and delivers more power to the snow. Increased traction and improved climbing capability are two other advantages. For the rider, it will be easier to steer and to lean.

The new ski design, tri-keel shape and new skags have a direct impact on performance too. This further enhances grip and handling.

On hard pack, lean angles will be better. In deep snow, there’s better control.

The ski-to-track ration on this Timbersled is one-to-one. The ski establishes the line and the track follows it, resulting in great carving and side-hilling.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

This new design is lighter – by about 11 pounds – so this also makes the bike more agile and helps to reduce rider fatigue.

To get the bike up on top of the snow faster with better lift, the design incorporates a raised drive shift.

Available for $5,499.

PODCAST: FIND OUT HOW FAITH HELPED THIS NAVY SEAL TO NEVER SURRENDER

Mission involves deep snow and steep mountain inclines

When a mission requires tackling terrain with extreme steep inclines and ultra-deep snow, then the Timbersled ARO 137 is a good fit.

AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR'S SHOW

This Timbersled will also give riders top acceleration, traction and flotation. The convex track design means it is easier to lean and steer. It has increased track speed and more power to the snow. All of which can be very handy on a winter warfare mission.

For civilians, this can mean fun times tearing it up even deeper off the trail in backcountry.

Like the 120, it is eleven pounds lighter than previous designs, so it is more agile, has better handing and will reduce fatigue. And its rear suspension is designed to mimic the feel and performance of a dirt bike.

Also similar to the 120, it has the new tri keel shaped ski and skags delivering better grip, more precise handling, better lean angles on hard pack and more control on deep snow.

Available for $6,199.

Mission travels rapidly through wooded terrain

Got a mountain mission where you need to rapidly travel through densely wooded and tricky terrain? Precision handling will be crucial and the RAW could be a good option.

AUSA 2017: THIS MILITARY ATV CAN 'THINK' AND DRIVE ITSELF

The ST 120 RAW incorporates a non-pivoting front suspension arm. This design enables extra precise handling. The Timbersled Convex 2.5 track is designed to deliver maximum deep powder traction.

This Timbersled also has that new tri keel shape and new skags. The RAW therefore also provides great angles on hard pack and more control in deep snow.

It also has a stylish aluminum side panel that enhances the snow bike’s robustness and reduces the weight.

Available for $3,499.

Mission – family fun

The ST 90 Ripper takes military grade tech and makes it accessible for families to enjoy. It is a great option for fun for all ages at the price point that is easiest on the pocket.

The Ripper kit includes a bogey wheel rail and the Ripper Ski is based on the Polaris Snowmobile Gripper Ski with a deeper upper and lower keel. This ensures it is compatible with hard-packed and loose snow while the Timbersled provides a low ride height and easy handling.

The Ripper fits Yamaha, Kawasaki and Honda 110cc bikes and can be installed in under an hour.

The message? Don't be thankful for the many blessings America has given you. Instead, act ungratefully, disrespectfully and unpatriotically

And sadly, some children are now following that example.

To cite just a few examples of protests around the country:

Four high school football players from Michigan were benched when they said they planned a kneeling protest. In Texas, two high school players were kicked off their team after protesting during the anthem. Good decisions in both cases.

And football players on a team made up of boys 8 and younger were joined by their coach in kneeling during the playing of our anthem in Illinois, after the coach told them about the protests started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Unbelievably, the coach said: “I felt like it was a good teaching moment for me.”

Teaching what? Hatred of America?

Schools are hyper-vigilant nowadays about not tolerating student expressions that might offend anyone. For example, a school in Texas shut down a voluntary Bible discussion during the lunch hour. God – oops, pardon that expression – forbid that any atheist child should be offended.

If students banded together in a planned show of disrespect for a rainbow flag – the symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride – you’d better believe they’d be punished for intolerance.

And if students held a protest objecting to radical political Islam, there’s no doubt they’d be disciplined for bigotry. The same would happen if students denounced and disrespected any country on Earth – with one exception.

When student football players disrespect America, our anthem and our flag, what happens? They get applauded by the left. That’s because the left hugs First Amendment language like an endangered tree when it comes to disrespecting the American flag and our anthem.

In 2010 the Department of Justice began studying bullying in school based upon “national origin” and other differences. That’s no surprise. There’s been a federally recognized prohibition against discriminating against national origin since the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

The federal government’s website dedicated to eradicating direct and indirect bullying noted this example of prohibited conduct from North Carolina: ""Bullying or harassing behavior includes … acts ... motivated by any actual or perceived differentiating characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin.”

Bullying of this kind is frequent. A New York survey this year of middle and high school students showed that 65 percent of respondents said bullying occurred because of “race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or citizenship/immigration status.”

So what does the federal government do with a local bullying incident in the United States? The Justice Department, explaining on its website about an LGBT student it helped, said it intervenes:

“The School District knew of the harassment ... neither fully investigated the allegations, nor followed its anti-harassment policies and procedures. The failure to address and prevent this kind of bullying from occurring violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”

Let’s examine how a recent real-life incident of anthem kneeling could still play out.

On Sept. 28, football players at Monroe Township High School in New Jersey knelt during the national anthem. Two referees walked off in protest, leaving the legitimacy of the game in doubt. Only the refs were punished, being suspended for the rest of the season.

Monroe has a bullying policy. In pertinent part it defines and prohibits as follows:

“Harassment, intimidation, or bullying means any gesture ... motivated by either any actual or perceived characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression; that ... has the effect of insulting or demeaning any student or group of students.”

What should happen next is that a parent of any American student insulted by the disrespect for America should demand that the school enforce Monroe’s bullying policy and discipline the kneelers.

If the school doesn’t act, the parent has a private right of action to sue the school under Title IX. The parent can have the Justice Department intervene to enforce their child’s rights.

They say the key to organization is a place for everything and everything in its place. This is true for even the smallest items, such as your kitchen utensils. These include your everyday flatware as well as the many small but mighty cooking tools a serious chef requires. Here are some of my favorite options for storing your utensils, in any space and on any budget.

Step One: Eliminating

Before you can organize any part of your home properly, you need to do some culling, and this is especially true in the kitchen. Drawers can quickly become filled with unused tools and gadgets, so take a hard look at the items you own and find as many as possible to give away or box up.

You may never get your collection of utensils down to the perfectly minimal arrangements, but the more items you can eliminate, the easier it will be to store and find the truly useful ones. Never use the little dessert spoons that came with your cutlery set? Only used that special spatula (designed to perfectly flip a single egg) the one time? Stash these items away in less reachable spaces such as upper cabinets to free up more prime cabinet real estate.

If Renovating, Make a Plan for Success

If you’re renovating or building a kitchen, you shouldn’t put off the organizational considerations until all the construction is complete. Thinking in advance about how to hold your collection of tools will produce a much better result. Planning to include a few drawers specifically sized for utensils will save a lot of potentially wasted space.

Typical cutlery trays aren’t very wide. Your basic eating utensils get used every day, but they don’t need that much space. A drawer just 10 to 12 inches wide will provide the right amount of space for those items without the need to have them share space with whisks and ladles.

Give depth some (deep) thought. Besides considering the width of the drawers, don’t forget to think about the depth. Drawers are often 6 to 8 inches deep (on the exterior face) by default simply because the cabinet has been split evenly into three to four drawers. However, a 4- to 5-inch-deep drawer (again, on the face, which translates to just a few inches inside) is all you need to store well-organized utensils. Using more and shallower drawers keeps items from getting piled on top of each other and lost in the mix.

Ideally, you should look at the collection of utensils you have (or plan to have) and map out exactly how much space they will need. This takes some extra effort upfront, but you will end up with a much better allocation of space than by simply choosing drawers in an arbitrary width. You can try laying out your utensils on a dining table to get a visual picture (and some measurements) of how much space they ideally would get.

Mix drawers and doors. Often people think of drawer cabinets and basic shelf cabinets as being two separate things, but they definitely can be mixed to meet your needs more efficiently.

Cabinets with a drawer at the top and doors and shelves below allow smaller, often-used items to be placed at a more reachable height, with the shelf storage left for more occasional items and oversized pieces. If you use lots of small chef’s tools when you cook, consider including many utensil drawers at the top level. It will save you a lot of bending down over time.

Consider going vertical. Want to tidy up your cutlery drawer without having to assign each piece an individual place? Try a drawer with vertical cutlery bins that let you simply drop in pieces with long handles (such as spatulas and slotted spoons) and pull them out easily. You’ll be able to see each piece, and you won’t have to remember exactly where you got it later.

You can store flatware vertically too. Cleverly retrofit a deeper drawer into a cutlery drawer by dividing it into small, deep compartments Just be sure you don’t store sharp items this way, or you may dull the blades (and risk accidents as well).

Create layers. Another way to make the best use of deep drawers is to break them up internally into layers. You can either use a built-in drawer divider system or find a layered drop-in unit.

RELATED: Shop Drawer Dividers for Your Kitchen Space

A tiered organizer can create compartments smaller than an individual drawer to gain maximum space efficiency. Just keep in mind that the upper layer will partially cover the lower layer (or will need to be slid individually), so you should put the most-used items on the most reachable tier.

Retrofitting: What Are the Options?

Single trays. A classic single cutlery tray is sometimes all you need, but keep in mind that these trays are not truly one-size-fits-all. Finding one that comes close to filling your drawer width will provide more structure versus a small tray that shifts around with use. Measure the interior of your drawer and look for a tray that fills it. Online shops will usually have more size options than a small local kitchen supply store.

Configurable trays. A step above the prefabricated single trays is a divider system made up of single compartments that can be mixed and matched like Tetris pieces to create spaces for all your items. If you can’t perfectly fill the full width, use the open space for a sturdy item such as a rolling pin or box of foil that will keep the other pieces from shifting.

Resizable dividers. Another step closer to a custom built-in is a resizable divider system that lets you snap together pieces to create any size compartments you like. An advantage of this sort of system is that you can change the configuration later to fit a different mix of items, or even fit a new drawer if you move or renovate.

Open storage vessels. For those who don’t mind having some of their utensils on display, simple open vessels or jars make a great place to hold your often-used items.

This can look especially great in a kitchen that makes use of open shelving already, with the utensil jars becoming part of the overall chef’s kitchen appeal.

Hanging rails. Another form of open storage is a rail that can be used to either hang utensils and tools directly (via a curved handle or a hook) or hang containers and holders to keep your utensils within easy reach but off the counter.

A wall-mounted system can be great for stealing a little storage space behind the range or elsewhere on the backsplash, which can be a lifesaver in a compact kitchen where every inch of storage space counts.

A pilot apprenticeship program sponsored by The Associated Builders and Contractors starting next year at Fort Drum in New York, home of the Army's 10th Mountain Division, looks to take away some of that uncertainty by providing valuable construction skills to service members before they make the next step into civilian life.

Michael Bellaman, the president and CEO of the national U.S. trade association, told Fox News on Monday the goal of this program is to take away the ""fragmented"" feeling some veterans face when trying to look for employment, specifically in the construction industry in this case.

""One of the big problems is that once you are out of the military it’s very, very difficult to find a portal and match up jobs in any kind of scale, aside from just putting that out in the paper,"" he said.

In a letter last year from The Chairman's Office of Reintegration, which leads the effort by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to enable the transition of veterans and their families back into civilian society, officials said around one million service members will hang up their uniforms in the next five years.

Bellaman, who is on President Trump's Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, said the program works by getting to veterans before they leave the military, but after they have an established discharge date. Veterans can then build a successful career by combining classroom knowledge, hands-on instruction and paid employment experience.

As part of the program, service members receive free core construction training using an industry-recognized curriculum that's set up by the National Center for Construction Education & Research.

At Fort Drum, initial plans are for three classes per year, with an average class size of 10 to 15 people. ABC, which is funding the entire program, expects to have at least 200 people complete the program over a 5-year period. Additional classes, however, could be added in the future.

""What better place to recruit from than the military?"" - Michael Bellaman

In the case of Fort Drum, a private company that's a member of ABC maintains and operates the family housing communities on base. The daily interaction between the management company and military families they are leasing to allows it to promote and help sign up interested service members for careers in construction, according to Bellaman.

After completing the ""core competency boot camp,"" ABC will also help work with its national network of 70 chapters and over 21,000 member companies to place them.

""The really neat thing about this is you have construction companies on bases, and so to be able to take that and take those kind of companies and marry them up with this opportunity makes a lot of sense,"" Bellaman told Fox News.

The program at Fort Drum will be similar to one the organization has used in previous settings to help veterans learn the electrical trade and earn their journeyman's license as a civilian. William Stewart, a participant of one of those classes, told Construction News in 2015 he thought the classes were invaluable and prepared him to use skills first learned in the military in other settings.

“In the military, I was all about repair, replace, maintain,” he said. “I had no clue that there was a National Electric Code, and there was a reason why certain devices were put in certain places or at what heights or anything like that.”

One of the group's members hired over 2,000 veterans in both craft professionals and management roles last year, according to Bellaman.

Depending on how the pilot program at Fort Drum goes, Bellaman hopes to scale it up across the country at other military instillations, and wants to see it become a larger national initiative across other industries.

The UNESCO process of granting World Cultural Heritage status is so blatantly commercial that a Japanese businessman got a faded silver mine that was closed in 1923 to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, even though there was nothing to look at.
Moreover, by declaring places World Cultural Heritage sites, UNESCO actually puts those sites at risk, due to increasing numbers of tourists, combined with lack of funds to care for the sites.
Come on – with all the starving children in the world, you’re really spending piles of money to determine whether Neapolitan pizza is a World Cultural Heritage?
Now you know why conservatives want us to stop funding the United Nations.","You might think you’re reading The Onion, but here’s breaking news that’s not fake: Italy has petitioned a United Nations agency to give Neapolitan pizza World Cultural Heritage status.

More than 2 million Italians, who clearly have far too much time on their hands – or too much pizza in their hands – have signed a petition requesting this special status for a special food.

The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will vote Monday in Seoul, South Korea, on this critically important international issue – assuming war doesn’t break out on the Korean Peninsula first.

If it sounds crazy to put pizza on the Intangible Cultural Heritage list, consider the fact that the geniuses at UNESCO have already given six other kinds of food items such revered status.

The lucky winners on the list are the Mediterranean diet, Turkish coffee, Croatian gingerbread making, French gastronomy, Mexican cuisine, and washoku (a collective term for traditional Japanese food).

Hey, what else do the U.N. bureaucrats have to do? There aren’t any more pressing world issues to deal with, are there? Or am I forgetting something?

Now you might expect me to fulminate against the silliness and wastefulness of grown men and women, no doubt making comfortable salaries, spending money given to the United Nations to debate the importance of pizza. But I won’t. Quite to the contrary, I’m thrilled.

After all, UNESCO is supposed to be about preserving the world’s true cultural heritage. But instead, the U.N. agency makes a political hash, to use a gastronomic metaphor, of everything it touches.

For example, UNESCO recently made Hebron a Palestinian cultural site. But Hebron’s Tomb of the Patriarchs – where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, and Leah are said to be buried – is revered by Jews and Christians worldwide.

In other words, UNESCO allows itself to be just one more U.N. mechanism for bashing Israel.

The UNESCO process of granting World Cultural Heritage status is so blatantly commercial that a Japanese businessman got a faded silver mine that was closed in 1923 to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, even though there was nothing to look at.

But that meant that a million tourists a year came to see what was left of the meaningless silver mine, which formerly had only attracted around 15,000 people.

Moreover, by declaring places World Cultural Heritage sites, UNESCO actually puts those sites at risk, due to increasing numbers of tourists, combined with lack of funds to care for the sites.

It’s almost like the Vietnam War argument of “We had to destroy the village in order to save it.”

So if UNESCO wants to mess around with menus, I’m all for it. The high-level diplomats dealing with this major world issue will spend real money for food, transport, and first-class lodging for the vote in Seoul – which could just as well have been taken via Skype or even email. But that wouldn’t have been as much fun, of course.

Who could pass up a chance for some delicious kimchi on the world’s taxpayers’ dime? Obviously not the “flying wedge of…gourmets,” as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page scolded UNESCO way back in the mid-1980s.

So if UNESCO wants to play with food, I’m all for it. Doing so will keep the agency from causing more mischief on the international stage.

Here are four more foods UNESCO should spend the next two years debating for its Intangible Cultural Heritage list, thus distracting the diplomats from inserting themselves into geopolitical issues outside of their brief.

1. The Subway Foot-long Meatball Sandwich

There is much to debate here. Should the length be 12 inches? Longer or shorter? White, wheat, rye or some other kind of bread? What kind of tomato sauce? These and other serious issues could easily take up hundreds of hours of debate.

2. Fenway Franks

Must be boiled in a metal urn. But what size, exactly? And what type of metal? Must be carried on the back of a teenager for several innings of baseball – but how many innings? And how should the hot dogs be served? Soft? Firm? Lukewarm? Piping hot? Soggy? With mustard? In what kind of bun?

And these are only some of the possibilities for world diplomats to consider. This should be good for at least six months of debate.

3. Haggis

This is a delicious (if you’re a Scot) pudding made of sheep's heart, liver and lungs, served in a pouch made from the animal’s stomach. The possibilities for debate on this are endless.

What are the precise qualities and measurements required for each ingredient? I doubt the UNESCO folks will embrace this dish, but they sure will love playing golf on the famed the Old Course in St. Andrew’s between ballots.

4. Crow

If they had the slightest bit of decency, the UNESCO folks would serve themselves a plate of crow with a side of humble pie. Come on – with all the starving children in the world, you’re really spending piles of money to determine whether Neapolitan pizza is a World Cultural Heritage?

Jasmine Harris, 21, woke with a small puncture wound like two pin pricks on her lower right leg one Sunday in May.

She coated it with antiseptic cream but it became increasingly painful and grew in size.

Harris, of Chichester, West Sussex, went to the hospital and was given antibiotics as doctors suspected it was a mosquito bite.

But in the following days she lost the ability to walk properly and the bite became a huge ulcer.

Tests identified potentially-fatal PVL-positive Staphylococcus aureus, a soft tissue infection which causes recurrent and invasive infections.

'DO NOT RESUSCITATE' TATTOO CAUSES ER EHTICAL DILEMMA

Harris said she is now unable to walk for more than 15 minutes without crippling pain and the injury has ruined her life.

She is in limbo with no indication of when it could finally heal, despite a cocktail of strong prescription drugs including morphine.

She suffers night terrors and is confined to her home after being signed off work.

""It has ruined my whole life. I have become uncomfortable, paranoid and feel ugly,"" Harris said. ""I have a limp and I'm living in pajamas and trackie bottoms. I have nightmares about it never healing most nights and see myself never being able to walk properly again.""

""I haven't had a bath in six months but can shower with my leg covered,"" she said. ""I want more help because doctors don't know why it isn't healing up.""

""When I went to the doctor's in May, I told them I was going on a two-week cruise in September,"" Harris said. ""They said 'Not to worry - it will definitely have healed by then because you are a young woman.' But it didn't and I was determined to still go as it was the Canary Islands and we'd paid a lot of money.""

""I sat in the sun but had to keep it covered at all times and I couldn't go swimming when it was 30C,"" she said.

Harris said her boyfriend, Brian Carter, 31, has been ""amazing"" during her ordeal and she would have struggled without him.

But he is at work for 10 hours per day as an accountant leaving her home alone after she was signed off from her job in a doctor's surgery two months ago.

She now hopes alternative treatment overseas will help.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss how rolling back net neutrality will impact internet providers and consumers. Pai explained how this rollback will remove the government from regulating how the internet works and return it to a market-based approach which will help the private sector improve innovation and give cheaper and faster internet service for Americans. When asked about concerns from tech giants, such as Netflix and Amazon, that internet service providers would be able to charge both consumers and websites for access, Pai said that is a hypothetical situation and something that has never happened and if it does happen the Federal Trade Commission would take action against any company, big or small, that behaves in an anti-competitive way.

The proposal to roll back net neutrality will be voted on December 14th by the five commissioners of the FCC.

Listen here:

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Welcome back, everyone. It's my privilege of bringing to for the first time to the show the Chairman of the FCC Ajit Pai. Ajit, welcome.

AJIT PAI, CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES FCC: Hey, thanks for having me on.

KILMEADE: Mr. Chairman, this is a pretty exciting day for you. You're rolling back net neutrality. What does that mean to the laymen?

PAI: Well, I think it means that we are getting government out of the business of regulating how the Internet works, and we're going to return to the market-based approach that served us well for two decades, and we're going to let this online platform be governed by engineers and entrepreneurs instead of bureaucrats and lawyers here in Washington.

KILMEADE: So a lot of people worry that their going to start risky fees to get high speed internet, and the average working blue collar guy already going paycheck to paycheck won't be able to afford a lot of these things.

PAI: It's going to mean exactly the opposite. For the past 20 years before 2015, we had a free and open internet that allowed the Internet to thrive and for consumers to benefit. One of the problems is that these heavy handed regulations have made it harder for the private sector to build out the networks especially in rural America, and so by going back to the previous regulations more, a more light touch approach, the Internet access is going to become better, we'll see much cheaper and who have better services, and I think the entire ecosystem's going to be a lot better off.

KILMEADE: So you think it's better for the consumer. I know that telcos seem to be happy, correct?

PAI: Well I think that most of these businesses don't want to have, especially in a dynamic environment like this one, to be regulated under rules that were developed in 1934 to tame the Mabel Telephone monopoly, and all we're simply saying is that we should have regulations that match the times in which we live, and to me the at least, the Internet is the greatest free market innovation in history and we want to keep it that way.

KILMEADE: Right. I mean, for example, do you worry about people having to get fee for high speed. For example, if I have a lot of money and I'm rolling out a high, I have big time investors, and my website's really fast, and if somebody else is trying to get their legs into - legs on underneath them in Iowa won't be able to have the same access, therefore there'll be almost against (ph) weighted against them.

PAI: No, to the contrary we want those folks to have access as well, to have a fair shot at competing, and that's exactly what our proposal would do. It puts the Federal Trade Commission in charge of making sure that there's not anti-competitive conduct, and the FCC itself would require transparency so that every Internet service provider would have to disclose how it's managing its business so that consumers and entrepreneurs alike can get the information that they need to make the right choices.

KILMEADE: So in that, this isn't just you even though you're a powerful man as Chairman of the FCC. This is going to go for a vote, correct?

PAI: That's right.

KILMEADE: And who's going to vote.

PAI: So it'll be a vote on December 14, the five Commissioners of the FCC, of which I'm one, will be voting, three republicans, and two democrats.

KILMEADE: What did the president say to you about this? Did he - is this your idea or his idea?

PAI: The president and the White House have not have any input on this issue at all, and this was our decision as an independent agency. We make our own decisions based on facts and the law.

KILMEADE: How about this. Just tell me some of the things that people are worried about if you're with Netflix or an investor that some of these telcos could hold - could hold streaming services like Netflix hostage by demanding more money from them. Do you worry about that?

PAI: Well I think the key word in your question is ""could."" This is all entirely hypothetical. We have never seen that in the 20 years or so that the commercial internet has existed. And going forward, we require transparency, as I said, to make sure that any practice like that would be disclosed, and we empower the Federal Trade Commission to take action against any company big or small that's behaving in any competitive way or otherwise harming consumers.

KILMEADE: You'll jump right back in if you see this happening?

PAI: Well, the Federal Trade Commission would be empowered to take action based on some of these principles that I've talked about.

KILMEADE: Understood. So you - do you - you do have some concern - you're almost in the it is (ph) you think it's going to work out, but you're not positive, right, that we'll never know because it's never been done?

PAI: No, to the contrary we do have a lot of experience from 1996 until 2015 starting with President Clinton's policy of having a market-based approach to Internet. We do know that this free and open Internet can exist free from these heavy-handed regulations that a partisan majority imposed in 2015.

KILMEADE: Gotcha. So now let's talk about something else that's on your plate kind of. Are you concerned with AT&T buying Time Warner about as (ph) for them forming something that is way too strong, way too consolidating, too much of a monopoly?

PAI: Well, that's a decision that the Department of Justice has made. The FCC did not review that transaction because the parties weren't transferring FCC licenses from one to other. And so we just didn't jurisdiction, so I can't really offer an opinion about (inaudible) with the transaction, the merits of it, or how it's been handled.

KILMEADE: Right, so that's not something that's going to come across your desk.

PAI: That's right. Yes, it's handled solely by the Depart of Justice.

KILMEADE: And so when would your vote be today? Well, when are you going to make the official announcement?

PAI: So the official announcement has just been made. I've shared the proposal to my fellow commissioners this morning, and we'll be voting on December 14 in a little over three weeks.

KILMEADE: And is this part of the whole deregulation of this administration?

PAI: Well, I'll let other agencies speak for themselves. All I can say from our perspective is that we want to update our rules to make sure that we promote as much economic growth and investment as possible, especially in the telecom industry that's one of the things that could really contribute to job creation into stronger communities. And so, if you look across the board, whether it's battling unwanted robocalls or freeing the Internet or unleashing innovation in the media space, we've really taking a forward thinking approach and we're not going to continue litigating these tired battles from the past.

KILMEADE: Ajit, you're in an exciting time to be Chairman of the FCC because everything's switching. I can't tell how many people say, ""I watch you on my iPhone,"" ""I'm watching you online,"" ""I get this showing streaming,"" as opposed to stations and cable outfits. How do you keep up with it? Where do you think we're heading?

PAI: It's a really exciting time. The downside I will say is that it doesn't seem like there's enough time to study all these great innovations that are happening and things like artificial intelligence and connected cars and alike, but I think the future is extremely bright. If you look at some of the breakthroughs that people are talking about, enabling people to take advantage of telemedicine or helping our kids learn through distance learning and alike, I think we stand on the brink of some pretty big breakthroughs. There are obviously going to be some - there's some discomfort with that, too, and we need to make sure that we educate everybody about what the possibilities and perils could be. But I think if we get the rules right here in Washington, there's no telling what kind of innovation could benefit consumers in the time to come.

KILMEADE: Very interesting because you know when you Capitol Hill, it's a very pournouisng (ph) atmosphere there, right? You're ready for that?

PAI: Yes, a little bit. It just goes with the territory, and you just have to have a thick skin and understand that folks there are doing their job, too.

KILMEADE: Some of these, the code pink (ph), are targeting your house?

PAI: Yes, some. I'm not sure who their representing, but they did make a stop by their residence not too long ago, and that's a part of the process, too. As long as nobody's being threatening to me or my family, they have a right to do it.

KILMEADE: Yes, I'd rather them just leave your block party alone. Ajit, thanks so much. Congratulations on the move.

But the holidays are also hectic, and technology affects every aspect of our winter existence. We shop online. We book e-tickets. We download recipes and exchange digital cards. Gadgets and apps can help streamline our holiday experience, but they can also complicate matters, or even give us a false sense of security.

To make your family plans as cheerful as possible, here are five digital tricks for the tech-savvy celebrant.

1. Keep spies out of your holiday rental

December is one of the busiest times of the year for travel, and millions of Americans will find themselves in hotels, family homes and rentals. This might be a ski lodge in the Adirondacks. It might be a cheap motel in the middle of a long road trip.

As cameras shrink and lodging gets more informal, you’d be forgiven for worrying about spies. There are plenty of weirdos out there, and they now have the technology to watch you in your room. So how do you protect yourself from secret surveillance?

Use your senses: Many devices emit a low-level hum you may hear when the room is completely quiet. Many cameras have tiny lights you may see when the room is dark.

Use a signal detector: Designed to pick up the signal from a hidden camera, these devices are about the size of a small walkie-talkie and are often equipped with infrared lights. You can sweep them across the room to catch pinhole cameras. Click here for more about signal detectors.

Use your cellphone: When you make a call near a recorder, the device’s frequency may interfere with your signal. If all else fails, you can call someone and walk around the room, listening for a significant crackle or delay. Not sure what you’re looking for? Click here for 10 types of spy cameras that could be watching you right now.

2. Stock up on movies for the road

Thanks to tablets and smartphones, we are no longer at the mercy of an airline’s cinematic selection. Once you hit cruising altitude, you can pull out your device and start watching. Better yet, you can download films for cheap, thanks to an ever-growing library of downloadable content. Click here to manage all your streaming services without going insane.

Netflix: The original streaming service once vowed never to make films available for download, but it’s recently changed its tune. Just install the free Netflix app, and you’ll find thousands of movies and TV series available. With a decent Wi-Fi signal, the download is shockingly fast.

Amazon: Anyone can install the Amazon Video app and start watching films they’ve purchased, but the real gold mine comes with Amazon Prime, which allows you to save content with the same ease and selection as Netflix.

Vimeo on Demand: If you’re weary of the same big-budget features, you’ll find zillions of obscure flicks and docs on Vimeo, the premiere platform for independent filmmakers. Just like mainstream services, you’ll need the Vimeo app to save your selections, but you’ll be amazed how much diversity is out there.

3. Destroy old hard drives before upgrading

Christmas is the perfect time to give and receive a new computer. Most new models have been released, and holiday discounts are everywhere. You’ll find doorbuster sales on laptops, desktops and tablets, which are timely if you’ve looking to upgrade.

But in the middle of the Christmas Day frenzy, you may forget to dispose of your old hard drive properly. Take my advice: Don’t get sloppy and toss your computer in the dumpster. It may be password protected, and the machine may languish in the city dump, but you never know who might dig your device out of the rubbish and hack into it, accessing all your private information.

The most cathartic method is to physically rip open the computer and smash the circuits and drive to bits with a hammer. This works, and it’s appropriate for computers that are too old to reuse, but there are slightly more civilized techniques you can use.

There’s the wrong way and the “write” way to delete files for good. Click here for the step-by-step instructions.

4. Get the details on HDR

If you’re in the market for a new television, you’ve probably heard a lot of chatter about HDR. But what is it? Is that like HD? 4K? Is it worth investing in?

HDR stands for “high dynamic range.” When it comes to visuals, HDR is basically about the range of light and dark. It promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a wider gamut of colors. So, theoretically, an HDR video played on an HDR-compatible television would look sharper, more detailed and more lifelike than on a non-HDR version.

Click here for one essential setting to get the clearest image on your smart TV.

HDR for television: At this particular moment, HDR is new and there isn’t a lot of content available. But media companies are clamoring to catch up, so you won’t have to wait too long for your HDR TV to pay off.

HDR for phones: The iPhone X is HDR compatible, which is exciting. But unless you have other motivations for buying an iPhone X (and there are many mind-blowing properties), it’s probably too early to buy a phone just for its HDR capabilities.

5. Let Google Maps guide your sleigh

GPS is a miraculous thing, especially when we’re driving complicated routes through unfamiliar cities. Google Maps has transformed the way people get around, and there are other mapping services (like Waze) that offer their own spin on navigation technology.

Open shelves in the kitchen can be used to store almost anything, but what should you place on them that truly works best? Here are some of my favorite uses for open shelving, along with some style tips to get the best arrangement for your kitchen.

Open shelves are a love-it or leave-it idea, but for those who love them, the breezy appeal is undeniable. They take an extra investment of time compared to closed cabinets (as more tidying is necessary), but they can add a lot of style and functionality without too much work.

Open shelves are especially suitable, I think, to transitional kitchen designs, in which a balance of traditional and contemporary sensibilities come together to produce beautifully livable spaces.

Daily Essentials

Some of the most common items to spot on open kitchen shelves are daily essentials like coffee mugs, plates and bowls. Items like this work well on open shelves for two reasons.

First, they’re kept in easy reach, which speeds up your morning just that little extra bit. And it’s especially convenient for guests who may want to grab a coffee mug or water glass without having to poke through every cabinet.

Second, putting often-used items on shelves avoids the issue of dust buildup. If the items are used frequently, they won’t sit for long. If you keep rarely used items like specialty glasses or serving pitchers on open shelves, be prepared to give them a rinse before use.

Drinking Glasses

Glasses are especially attractive items to store on an open shelf because their clear material plays into the breezy look. Storing basic drinking glasses upside down (as is typically done in restaurants) effectively seals out dust and debris, so the glass is ready to go whenever you grab it.

Again, for less commonly used pieces like martini glasses (for some, anyway), a quick rinse will generally do the trick before use, along with the occasional seasonal dusting.

Storage Jars

Storage jars are another great use for an easily reached shelf. This keeps items off the counter so you have more free space to work, but the jars are still handy so you can grab them without having to open a cabinet with (potentially) messy fingers.

Colorful Pieces

Besides practical uses, open shelves can also add a lot of character and beauty to a kitchen. Whether you already have a colorful kitchen or a more neutral scheme, shelves are a great place to introduce a new accent hue, such as classic rich-blue water glasses or copper mule mugs.

White Porcelain

In contrast to the previous tip, sometimes the items on open shelves can serve as a visual break on an already busy wall. If you have a dramatic tile or a stunning brick feature, simple white porcelain and other subdued pieces provide a pleasing counterpoint.

Coffee Station

If you have a nice coffee maker, you’ll likely want to carve out a little space to hold fresh beans, sugar, coffee spoons and other supplies to craft the perfect cup. A floating shelf above the machine creates a simple station to store everything, plus a few good go-to cookbooks.

And of course, for the tea drinkers (or home-soda aficionados), you can stash tea bags, honeys and syrups, cups and saucers … the list goes on. Just be sure to consider whether such items will be OK outside the fridge and potentially exposed to warm sunlight or exhaust from nearby appliances.

Home Bar

If you drink alcohol, you can also take an array of beautifully bottled liquors and make them into a simple home bar. Richly hued glass bottles with ornate labels make for a subtly colorful display with a sophisticated air, especially when paired with classic bar tools in a golden finish. To keep the arrangement lasting, you can always refill an emptied bottle with water and mix it back onto the shelf.

Cookware

If you cook often, you may want to have more than just your ingredients right at hand. Stacking casserole dishes, cake pans or even pasta pots on a shelf keeps them from getting buried in the back of cabinets. The look works especially well for kitchens with a rustic or industrial edge, where a little controlled chaos adds to the charm.

Tech Devices

Here’s an option you might never have thought of: using open shelves to dock your devices, like tablets or laptops. Angled shelves are great for storing devices securely, with any charging cables discreetly tucked behind the lip. It’s especially handy for those who cook along to online recipes. Alternately, you can locate them on a side wall out of the main cooking area, paired with some books to make an attractive library-like display.

Decorative Pieces

Do you love the look of open shelves but are concerned about having to dust lots of items? Consider using just a single shelf with only a few decorative pieces. You won’t have too much space to worry about filling or maintaining, but it will add a fun, contemporary twist to the space.

A Few Style Tips

To help you get the function and the look you love, try these kitchen shelf styling tips.

Play with heights and directions. Playing with the arrangement by mixing different-sized objects and small or short stacks of items creates a dynamic look.

Mix eclectic items. It also helps to mix diverse items, both practical and decorative pieces.

Go tone on tone. If you prefer a more subdued look, try sticking to all pale-colored objects. Try contrasting whites and off-whites to highlight the subtle undertones, along with a touch of glass and the occasional metallic accent.

Top with an upper shelf. Sometimes the best thing to put on your top shelf is: nothing! Leaving a bare top shelf as a topper gives a polished look to your shelving, which makes the whole space feel subtly tidier.

Highlight with a sconce. Finally, to really bring out the best of your shelving, add a sconce above to cast a little light on the situation. Don’t have the option of hardwiring a fixture? Choose a plug-in sconce that comes with an elegantly simple metal channel to hide wires, run it down behind the shelving or next to a cabinet, and let it add to the open look – or simply run the wires back to a cabinet so they can be hidden to reach a power source.",10 things to store on open kitchen shelves for efficiency and style,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/10-things-to-store-on-open-kitchen-shelves-for-efficiency-and-style.html

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



Democrats have a lot to say about the Republican tax-reform plan, including that it is a “middle class con job” and is going to cost the GOP its congressional majorities. That’s quite the bold claim, coming from the party that is in fact in uncharted tax-politics territory.

Americans have short political memories, which means it is no longer possible to remember a world in which Democrats didn’t hate tax cuts. And in the mainstream media—which shares the left’s penchant for class warfare—it’s also no longer possible to read an analysis that doesn’t assume Democrats are on the right side of history, that these tax cuts are “unpopular,” and that this reform holds grave political risks for Republicans.

Based on what? Democrats certainly have no modern evidence of these propositions, since they’ve never uniformly opposed tax cuts. In fact, it’s been 16 years since the party even engaged in a big tax brawl, during George W. Bush’s first year as president. What’s striking is just how many Democrats enthusiastically signed on to Mr. Bush’s tax bill, and just how far off the political rails the party has gone in the intervening years.

While the Bush tax package was hardly as sweeping as today’s reform, it contained similar provisions. It cut marginal rates across the board, even knocking nearly 5 points off the top marginal rate for the 1%. It cut capital-gains taxes and lowered the estate tax to zero in 2010, before the reductions expired.

Plush, velvety carpet is a wonderful thing to wake up to in the morning. It’s also a practical choice, adding warmth and acoustic protection to a room that’s all about relaxation. We’ve asked three experts to discuss what you need to know if you’re in the market for new soft flooring for your bedroom.

Why Carpet?

The bedroom is a sanctuary for many of us — somewhere we can escape to and recharge for the day ahead. Few things say relaxation better than the feel of soft, luxurious carpet underfoot, says Harriet Isaac-Cole, interior architect at design firm The Designory. “Carpet adds a layer of softness and warmth that hard floor sometimes can’t give you,” she says.

And unlike busy parts of the home such as the hallway and family room, where practicality is likely to steer your design choices, low-traffic bedrooms give you license to indulge in sophisticated materials such as plush and oversized loop-pile carpet.

“Most of our customers will select a more luxurious carpet option for their bedroom compared with the carpet they choose for other areas of the home,” says Jason Verstak, group manager for marketing at Choices Flooring.

Color Trends

Darker hues are dominating in bedroom carpet color choices these days, Isaac-Cole says. “This year it’s all about creating a cozy, luxurious atmosphere in the master bedroom, a retreat away from the rest of the house. As a result, we’re seeing darker colors in plush finishes coming through.”

Maria Roussos, interior decorator at design firm Schemes and Spaces, agrees. “For some time now, sandy and taupe textures have dominated,” she says. “But now there are so many more options in the gray palette in both loop and plush piles, which are gorgeous for the bedroom.”

Consider the Room Design When Selecting Color

“When choosing a carpet, color is the most important element to get right,” Isaac-Cole says. “It needs to link to the rest of the palette as well as complement the other textural elements in the room. Think about your wall color and finish, window treatments, furniture style, even bedding.” Consider what the focal point of the room is and look for a carpet that complements it rather than overpowers it.

You should also consider the feel you want to create. “Ask yourself, ‘How soft or layered do I want the texture and pile of the carpet to be? How do I want it to feel underfoot when I step out of bed?’ ” Isaac-Cole says.

“For versatility, the best carpet shades for most schemes are charcoal, taupe and sand,” Roussos says. And if you have children and pets dashing in and out of your bedroom on a regular basis? “Midtones are the safest choice, as they will disguise dust and stains.”

RELATED: How to Get Rid of Carpet Stains

Pile Types

You should also think about which pile type suits your decor and lifestyle, Verstak says. “Ask yourself what decorating style you want to achieve. Plush and twist styles will give you a more luxe look, for example. If you have a very textured room scheme, you may want to consider a loop or textured carpet.”

A loop-pile carpet can also be used to add a casual vibe to your bedroom, Roussos says. “There are some gorgeous loop piles on the market, in a variety of textures and shades that will give you a relaxed Hamptons or coastal look.”

Tip: “If you’ll be allowing pets into your bedroom, then a twist style is best as their claws won’t get caught in the fibers,” Verstak says.

Pile Height and Density

When choosing a carpet, pay attention to pile height and density as well, Roussos says. “If hotel luxe is the mood you’re aiming for, a long, plush pile carpet is the ultimate choice. Shorter, tighter piles are harder- wearing and will show less wear and indentation.”

Materials

There are several materials to choose from, including wool, nylon, wool-nylon blends and more luxurious options such as alpaca and wool-silk blends. “For softness, luxury and graceful aging, pure wool carpet is hard to beat,” Verstak says. “In addition to its natural, sustainable and insulating properties, wool carpet is also easy to maintain.”

Isaac-Cole is also a fan of wool: “It’s definitely an enduring favorite, low in allergens and with perfect softness.”

That’s not to say you should rule out nylon, particularly the latest high-quality solution-dyed nylons. “Thanks to technological innovations, synthetic carpets are becoming softer and more luxurious all the time,” Verstak says. “Generally speaking, they are more cost-efficient, hard-wearing and stain-resistant than pure wool carpets.”

For the best of both worlds, consider a wool blend, which will give you the durability of a synthetic and the natural appeal of wool, Verstak says. “They are perfect for those wanting a wool carpet that also keeps up with the practicality of busy lifestyles,” he says.

Be Aware of Shading

If you have your heart set on a plush carpet, be aware that shading is a feature of this style. “Plush carpets are created by cutting the loops and then shearing the tips of the fibers,” Verstak says. “Pile reversal shading is when there appears to be a color difference in the carpet when you walk or vacuum over it. For that reason, plush carpet is generally best used in the master bedroom or other quiet spaces in the home.”

Color also plays a part in how noticeable this effect is, Roussos says. “Carpet shading is usually more obvious in darker shades than lighter ones.”

Do Your Homework

With so many options available, choosing the right carpet style can be a challenge. But there are a few things you can do to make the process easier.

“It’s a good idea to take along images to the showroom of the look you want to create, as well as materials and colors that you’ve selected for the room,” Verstak says. “When you’ve narrowed down your options, take home samples so you can see what they look like at different times of the day and under different light conditions.”

And of course, don’t forget to put your favorite styles to the most important test of all: the softness test. For this, all you need to do is slip off your shoes and let your toes sink in.",8 things to consider when adding carpet to your bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/16/8-things-to-consider-when-adding-carpet-to-your-bedroom.html

That’s right, the entire nation of New Zealand is totally owning the Christmas spirit by hosting a nationwide Secret Santa program that is guaranteed to bring joy to everyone involved.

More than 3,600 people in the country have signed up to take part in the national gift exchange, according to the Secret Santa program, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

This marks the seventh year of the program, which was started in 2010 by a guy named Sam (just Sam, no last name), who simply put out a call on Twitter asking if his fellow citizens would like to take part in a gift exchange. The program became so popular that the government took notice and made it a state-sponsored event.

The rules of the exchange are fairly simple. As the site states, participants must first use #nzsecretsanta to tweet and @nzsecretsanta to talk to the elves running the show. Next, they must link their Twitter account to a New Zealand Post online account. Next to-do is to spend a little time following the matched giftee to find out what they like, and then buy or make an awesome gift for about $10.

Participants are supposed to send their gift as soon as possible so the elves can get to work, and then all they have to do is wait for their own gift to arrive (and tweet a photo of it to share the joy with the world).

If you don’t live in New Zealand but still want to participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange, you can join Reddit’s worldwide gift program. Each year thousands of people, including Bill Gates, sign up to exchange gifts with total strangers they’ve never met. It sounds crazy, but it truly does encapsulate what the holidays really are all about: spreading joy.

Editor's note: The following column first appeared on The Resurgent.

For the last several years, Democrats have been complaining about the constitution. While they lament Donald Trump's supposed disregard for the constitutional processes in the United States, they have been trying to delegitimize the fifty states as semi-sovereign powers in our federal system.

Democrats do not like that states are not just administrative subdivisions of Washington and they hate that the Senate has legitimacy.

Levine's accuser, now middle-aged, contacted the police department in Lake Forest, Illinois, in October of 2016 to report that he'd had sexual contact with the conductor when he was under age 18.

He said he was reaching out to police in Lake Forest because some of his encounters with Levine took place there in the mid-1980s. Levine served as music director at the Ravinia Festival, outside Chicago, from 1973 to 1993.

Details of the police report were first reported Saturday on the website of the New York Post. Met officials said they learned of the police report last year.

""This first came to the Met's attention when the Illinois police investigation was opened in October 2016,"" the Met said in a statement. ""At the time, Mr. Levine said that the charges were completely false, and we relied upon the further investigation of the police. We need to determine if these charges are true and, if they are, take appropriate action. We'll now be conducting our own investigation with outside resources.""

""We need to determine if these charges are true and, if they are, take appropriate action."" - Metropolitan Opera statement

An email to Levine's manager seeking comment on the accusations was not immediately returned.

The accuser, whose name is being withheld by The Associated Press, contacted reporters from several news organizations and posted a handful of items on social media accusing Levine of abusing him when he was young.

The Lake Forest department assigned a detective who spent at least seven months investigating the allegations, according to a redacted copy of her written reports on the case.

The accuser, who at the time was hoping for a career in music, told police the conductor had invited him to audition for him in New York and then encouraged him to engage in sexual ""experimentation.""

He also said that his relationship with Levine extended well into adulthood and that the composer gave him money over the years when he was having financial problems, amounting to more than $50,000.

The man told police he last spoke with Levine in 2014. At the time, he said, Levine said he wouldn't send him money anymore.

The Associated Press does not generally name alleged victims of sexual abuse without their consent. In this case, the man asked that his name not be published and declined to be interviewed on the record.

The accusations against Levine, among the most prominent classical music conductors in the world, are the latest in a stream of sexual misconduct charges involving high-profile men in entertainment and the media that have rocked the nation since accusations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein were reported in October.

Levine served as music director of the Met from 1976 to 2016, when he assumed the position of music director emeritus.

Levine has struggled with health problems including Parkinson's disease in recent years but is scheduled to conduct several productions this season.

Employees at Cash’s Liquor Store in Fort Walton Beach went back to work the day after Thanksgiving and discovered a strange sight: an opossum next to a broken and empty bottle of bourbon.

Owner Cash Moore told Northwest Florida Daily News this was the first time he’s experienced an opossum break-in at his business.

""She came in from the outside and was up in the rafters, and when she came through she knocked a bottle of liquor off the shelf,"" Moore told Northwest Florida Daily. ""When she got down on the floor she drank the whole damn bottle.”

Michelle Pettis, a technician at Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge, said the female opossum, who was brought in by a police officer, appeared pale and disoriented and was salivating excessively.

“A worker there found the opossum up on a shelf next to a cracked open bottle of liquor with nothing in it,” Pettis told the newspaper. “Assuming the opossum drank it all, he brought her to us, and we looked over her and she definitely wasn’t fully acting normal.”

The staff pumped the marsupial with fluids to flush out the alcohol in her system. She sobered up in a few days and was released on Thursday unharmed.

The opossum also appeared to have escaped a dreadful hangover, according to Pettis.

It’s still unclear how the animale broke into Cash’s. Pettis described the animal as “fairly large.”

The refuge center posted on its Facebook page Friday a photo of the opossum with the caption: “On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: a drunk opossum in a box!

Colorado Civil Rights Commission is finally having its day before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the decision and the Colorado Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
Last year, Phillips petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the Colorado ruling violates the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.
But he wonders whether it’s time to revisit the precedent, now that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia – who authored the opinion – has died.","It started over five years ago with a simple request for a wedding cake. And now, after wending its way through the system, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission is finally having its day before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Many legal experts believe it will be the most significant case of the term. It involves a clash of our rights as citizens, as well as our ideals.

Two of the most precious rights Americans possess are freedom of expression and freedom to practice their religion as they see fit. Both are enshrined in the First Amendment.

But these rights are not absolute. They sometimes may clash with a duty toward others. Masterpiece Cakeshop will test these limits.

It began in July 2012, when Charlie Craig and David Mullins asked Jack Phillips, who owned the Masterpiece Cakeshop, to create a custom wedding cake to celebrate their same-sex marriage. Phillips refused, saying he didn’t wish to promote a same-sex wedding due to his religious beliefs.

One thing is for sure – no matter how it’s decided, the case will be a blockbuster.

Craig and Mullins filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The commission decided against Phillips, declaring he had discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation.

The commission ordered Masterpiece Cakeshop to change its policies, give its staff training on discrimination, and provide quarterly reports for two years on steps taken to comply with the order.

The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the decision and the Colorado Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Last year, Phillips petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the Colorado ruling violates the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.

The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Since then, almost a hundred briefs have been filed by groups around the country, arguing over the numerous potential legal ramifications.

Dr. John Eastman, a professor and former dean at Chapman University’s school of law, believes the free speech argument is strong, because Phillips’ work involved “expressive conduct.”

“Whether it’s a photographer, or a cake-maker, or a T-shirt designer,” he notes, “they’re engaged in expressive activity” which is covered by the First Amendment. In fact, in the case of “T-shirts or language on a cake, it’s actual speech.”

But Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at University of California, Berkeley, counters that the expressive activity comes from the customers. “If I choose the words on my cake, I’m engaging in expression. The baker is simply putting my words on a cake.”

Further, Chemerinsky notes that “even if this is about speech” that doesn’t mean the government can’t intercede. And in this case, “the interest in preventing discrimination outweighs” other interests. For instance, the baker would lose in court if he were “against interracial marriage and won’t bake a cake for an interracial couple.”

Eastman suggests we “shift the facts” and imagine a “white racist who wants an African-American baker to bake a cake celebrating the Ku Klux Klan.” If the courts tried to claim creating the cake “doesn’t implicate free speech rights, people would be howling.” Phillips was willing to serve homosexuals in his shop, but he didn’t want to be forced to support their beliefs.

As for the related free exercise of religion argument, Chemerinsky says that under the Supreme Court decision Employment Division v. Smith (1990), state law – such as Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws – may limit what people claim is their religious right, as long as the statutes are “neutral laws of general applicability” and not aimed at religion.

Eastman agrees that the Smith ruling makes the free exercise argument a tougher sell. But he wonders whether it’s time to revisit the precedent, now that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia – who authored the opinion – has died.

Court observers believe the decision could go either way. They’ll be watching the newest justice, President Trump’s pick Neil Gorsuch, for signs of how he’ll vote. More importantly, most say, is which way Justice Anthony Kennedy goes. If it’s a close case, it’s generally thought he’ll most likely cast the deciding vote.

One thing is for sure – no matter how it’s decided, the case will be a blockbuster. Eastman believes this could be bigger than the Hobby Lobby opinion a few years back, which allowed a company an exemption from a contraceptive mandate due to religious objections.

And the job to voice the stuttering cartoon was already taken by Mel Blanc, a celebrated actor who provided voices for 3,000 characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and yes, Porky Pig.
Bergen voices not only Porky Pig, but also Tweety Bird, Marvin the Martian and Sylvester Jr. among others for Looney Tunes.
Because Mel Blanc said it once when he first got the job in the ‘30s.
So, when I say ‘That’s all folks,’ I’ll say… ‘Do you want 1930s Mel Blanc ‘That’s all folks’ or 1980s Mel Blanc ‘That’s all folks?’… It’s different.","Bob Bergen already knew what he wanted to do for the rest of his life at age 14 — become a Looney Tune.

Specifically, Porky Pig. Except the Cincinnati native was still in high school. And the job to voice the stuttering cartoon was already taken by Mel Blanc, a celebrated actor who provided voices for 3,000 characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and yes, Porky Pig.

So, Bergen decided to do the next best thing — move to Los Angeles and watch the master at work, with his mother’s permission of course.

“I found his number in the phone book,” the 53-year-old told Fox News. “I called him up. He mentioned the name of a studio he was working at that week. He didn’t mention the day or the time… So when I finished my conversation with him, I called the studio pretending to be his assistant to get the actual day and time. Told my mom I was skipping school to watch him and she said ‘cool.’

""So the day of the recording session, I told the receptionist we were friends of Mel Blanc, and he said we can come. And she said, ‘Oh, he’s in there.’ And when we walked in there, I said to his producer, ‘Hi, we’re friends of the receptionist and she said we can come him.’ I just watched him work.”

Bergen was compelled to study acting until his big break finally came. After years of pursuing his craft Hollywood, Bergen was chosen in 1990 to lend his voice for the Warner Bros. animated series.

He was always grateful for that chance encounter with his idol. Blanc died at 81 in 1989, a year prior to Bergen's new gig.

Bergen voices not only Porky Pig, but also Tweety Bird, Marvin the Martian and Sylvester Jr. among others for Looney Tunes. Still, there’s one line Bergen still has trouble saying — Porky's fumbling “That’s all folks!” finale.

“It’s actually the hardest thing,” said Bergen. “'That’s all folks' is the most difficult thing I have to say. Because Mel Blanc said it once when he first got the job in the ‘30s. And after a few years, he used the original recording and, before I think the ‘40s, they stopped having Porky come out of the drum and [say the line].

""He didn’t do it again until he started doing press in the ‘80s. And his voice had changed. He was older. So, when I say ‘That’s all folks,’ I’ll say… ‘Do you want 1930s Mel Blanc ‘That’s all folks’ or 1980s Mel Blanc ‘That’s all folks?’… It’s different. So I just do whatever I think feels good…”

And while Bergen gets to transform into a medley of characters for Looney Tunes, the Emmy-nominated actor has been chosen to voice countless other animated TV shows and films over the years. One of his roles even developed a cult following, unbeknownst to him.

“I did a film called ‘Spirited Away,’” described Bergen. “I play this character No Face… I didn’t know it was a cult following until I would go to conventions and I would have all my pictures of Looney Tunes and people were like, ‘Do you have anything of No Face?’… And I voiced Luke Skywalker for a lot of ‘Star Wars’ projects… I’m not as knowledgeable about the ‘Star Wars’ universe as I should be. So every time I have a session, I need pronunciations of planets and people and droids.”

Bergen may have been doing Skywalker voice for 20 years, but he initially turned down the role of the greatest Jedi because he felt another beloved voice actor deserved the job more — Mark Hamill, the film’s original star.

“I turned down the audition originally because I said, ‘Well, Mark Hamill is Luke Skywalker,'” admitted Bergen. “I can’t do Mark Hamill. And the producer said, ‘Don’t do Mark Hamill, do Luke Skywalker.’ So I guess there was something similar in my voice print that was much like the character. But Mark is Luke Skywalker. And he’s a genius at voiceovers. But with the projects I’m doing, I don’t think about the voice. I think about the integrity of the character.”

Bergen has also managed to befriend many stars along the way, all thanks to his unique talent. He credited actress Lily Tomlin as a dear friend, one whom he recently presented a special award to at the 2017 Voice Arts Awards in November. There’s also Alfred Hitchcock muse Tippi Hedren, of “The Birds” fame. The pair previously collaborated for a fundraiser to support her animal sanctuary.

Bergen came ready for the part as Tweety.

“She interviewed me and Dee Bradley Baker, who does Daffy Duck, and we did a scene from ‘The Birds’ where she played her character… Porky and Daffy played everybody else… It was really kind of wacky and surreal with lions around us.”

Bergen still continues to pursue his passion and he has zero plans to slow down. Porky brings home the bacon, among his many roles, and he frankly wouldn’t have it any other way.

“You certainly have to love what you do,” advised Bergen. “… I’m known for the cartoons, but my day-to-day is every genre of voiceover… [But] really just love the whole journey. The whole thing, it just doesn’t end. I’m blessed that every day, I wake up and I got to my home studio and say, ‘What’s today got?’ It’s going to be different than yesterday and that’s very cool as an actor.”

And Bergen relishes making people smile, even when he’s not on camera.

“After 9/11, a bunch of us went to Krispy Kreme,” he recalled. “We just had to get out and we needed calories. And I’m at the drive thru and the woman says, ‘May I take your order?’ And I said, give us a second, we haven’t decided yet.’ And this male voice came on and said, ‘Tell me when you’re done.’ And I said, ‘Oh, you changed your voice!’ And she came back and said, ‘Yes I did, now you change yours.’

""I ordered a dozen glazed donuts like Porky Pig… I pull to the next window and she gives me three dozen donuts. I said, ‘I don’t think you quite understood what I said.’ And she said, ‘We understood everything you said. First time we laughed in a couple of days. We needed this laugh. Thank you very much. They’re on us.’ I turned to my friends and said, ‘Want to go to a Porsche dealer next?’”","Looney Tunes star Bob Bergen reveals how he became the voice of Porky Pig, Tweety Bird",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/30/looney-tunes-star-bob-bergen-reveals-how-became-voice-porky-pig-tweety-bird.html

“I even went out a few times with Don Most… I was booked on the show and [‘Happy Days’] always taped on Fridays.
“The commercial was being shot that Thursday, which would have been the dress rehearsal,” she explained.
She thought it would be her chance to convince him her latest gig wouldn’t interfere with her appearance on ""Happy Days.""
""At no time did I ever have the authority to hire or fire anybody when I was on 'Happy Days.'","Rhonda Shear may be leading a multi-million dollar business designing lingerie, but she still wonders what life could have been like as a sitcom actress.

The 63-year-old television personality-turned-entrepreneur recently released a memoir titled “Up All Night: From Hollywood Bombshell to Lingerie Mogul, Life Lessons from an Accidental Feminist,” which details her many adventures in Hollywood as a beloved comedienne.

The New Orleans native told Fox News her first major audition came at age 23 for “Happy Days,” the 1950s-themed series that aired from 1974 until 1984. Shear got her big break playing Fonzie’s (Henry Winkler) girlfriend in 1979 after impressing producers and cast directors, but she claims a misstep with Winkler cost her the sitcom gig. Winkler denies that he was involved in the decision to let her go.

“The whole cast got to know me,” recalled Shear. “I even went out a few times with Don Most… I was booked on the show and [‘Happy Days’] always taped on Fridays. You rehearsed for a week, [and] Thursday you would have a dress rehearsal.”

The aspiring actress said she was thrilled when she was offered to appear in a fried chicken commercial at the same time. It meant more money to survive in Hollywood on her own, away from family and loved ones.

“The commercial was being shot that Thursday, which would have been the dress rehearsal,” she explained. “I called up the casting director, I called the producer. I got the OK from everybody… I mean, with the commercial, there’s great money, there’s residuals.

""I’m 24 years old and I’m trying to make a living. You get a commercial and you get paid as long as it runs. I got the blessing from everybody to go off and do it. Except from Henry.”

Shear claimed the commercial didn’t sit well with Winkler, who was the leather-clad star of “Happy Days.”

“I showed up on Friday, which is tape day,” said Shear. “I showed up to my dressing room and my name wasn’t on the door. It was someone else’s name. I was walking around and everyone was kind of avoiding me.

""And finally, someone said, ‘Well, when you weren’t here for dress rehearsal, Henry flipped out and he took the girl that was standing in for you, made her a Screen Actors Guild member immediately and hired her.’ I was shocked… [That person] said, ‘He’s the star. He has the power.' I was mortified. I was crying.”

Shear said she was then asked to see Winkler in his dressing room. She thought it would be her chance to convince him her latest gig wouldn’t interfere with her appearance on ""Happy Days.""

“He sits me down and he gives me this major lecture,” she said. “How, if I was a serious actress, I would have never taken a commercial… I was nervous, but I told him I had permission from everyone. He said, ‘Well, you didn’t get it from me.’ He then walked out and left me with my costume in hand… They didn’t blackball me, but I never heard from ‘Happy Days’ again.”

Winkler told Fox News in an email that he doesn't remember the incident Shear described.

""I really don't remember the incident that happened almost 40 years ago, but if Ms. Shear was given permission to miss a dress rehearsal by the executive producers and Jerry Paris, the director, it was not my place nor did I have the ability to contradict them.

""I probably did tell her she should have not booked a commercial during the same week as the show, which had only four half-days of rehearsal before we shot in front of a live audience, but that is as far as it went.

""At no time did I ever have the authority to hire or fire anybody when I was on 'Happy Days.' It would never occur to me to ask that any actor be fired.""

Shear claimed her alleged rough ending on ""Happy Days"" soured her relationship with creator Garry Marshall, who famously worked on other top sitcoms.



“My dream was to do a sitcom in Hollywood,” she explained. “But that pretty much kept me out of all that. I know everyone talks about Henry being this great guy, and in some ways, yes, he was really nice to me prior to that day… But I just thought that was a little bit too far of a penalty… As a young person trying to live out her dream, I thought that was pretty horrible.""

Still, Shear would go on to find success. Prior to “Happy Days,” she posed for Playboy in 1977 when photographers for the publication visited New Orleans scouting for models to appear in an issue titled ""Girls of the New South.""

Shear, already with a modeling agency at the time, was willing to appear for Playboy as long as she kept her clothes on. Despite the seemingly strange request, it wouldn’t be the last time she collaborated with the magazine.

“I was wearing a dress right out of Scarlett O’Hara,” she chuckled about her first shoot. “I’m completely covered. It’s a little picture, but everyone around me was naked… Playboy and I developed this great love affair without nudity… It was very respectful and done on my terms. Playboy for sure never hurt my career.”

Shear was in three layouts for Playboy, including at the height of her fame when she starred as the ditzy blonde hostess in the comedy-meets-weekend movie program “Up All Night,” which aired from 1991 until 1995.

“I wanted to show you can be sexy and funny,” said Shear. “[But] it was hard to do. I was completely shy and terrified… But they make you feel good about yourself… A lot of people are way more comfortable with nudity or wearing as little clothes as possible. I’ve never been. I’ve just never been that person. But I felt I was in good shape. I did my last layout when I was 36… I have no regrets that I did it.”

In fact, it was Shear’s blonde bombshell personality that helped her land the audition for “Up All Night.” It also inspired her to later launch a career in intimate apparel design, which she still happily pursues today.

“Everyone went to the audition basically wearing suits and jackets,” she said about landing her role in ""Up All Night."" “I showed up in this skintight spandex dress and a blow-dryer and was blow-drying my hair for the meeting. At that point, I had been in Hollywood since 23 and now I was 35.

""I just took a chance. I went bigger and I got it… We did 450 shows and it still holds up today. I’m really proud of my work. It was basic cable in its early days. We got away with a lot more than you would do today.”","Playboy model Rhonda Shear claims Henry Winkler hurt her sitcom career, but actor denies he had her fired",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/28/playboy-model-rhonda-shear-claims-henry-winkler-hurt-her-sitcom-career-but-actor-denies-had-her-fired.html

The Utah Highway Patrol estimated the crowd to be about 5,000 people, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Trump will travel to Utah on Monday to help sell the idea of cutting the size of Bears Ears and Grande Staircase-Escalante National Monuments.

But the plan faces opposition from environmentalists and tribal leaders, who have decried it as illegal and an affront to Native Americans.

Attorney general for the Navajo Nation, Ethel Branch, said Trump should visit the monuments before making a decision on them.

“I want him to visit Bears Ears before he takes any action,” Branch said.

Trump plans to shrink Bears Ears National Monument by nearly 85 percent and reduce Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by almost half.

The plan would cut the total amount of land in the state’s red rock country protected by monument status from more than 3.2 million acres to about 1.2 million acres, the Washington Post reported.

Trump has reportedly told U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and other Utah officials that he will follow the recommendations of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke regarding the monuments.

Bears Ears was designated a national monument in 2016 by President Barack Obama. Staircase-Escalante was designated in 1996 by President Bill Clinton.

Fitzgerald's leg bent in an awkward position when he was tackled following a running play. The game was delayed for several minutes while Fitzgerald received treatment on the field before being carted off.

Fitzgerald came into the game leading the SEC in yards rushing for a quarterback, with 968 yards on the ground in 11 games. He also has thrown for 1,770 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.

Fitzgerald was replaced by freshman Keytaon Thompson, who has thrown for 66 yards and a touchdown this season.

Mississippi State, which entered the game ranked No. 16 in the country, lost to Ole Miss 31-28.

The Rebels (6-6, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) had a 10-6 lead at halftime and then broke the game open in the third quarter with Brown's 77-yard touchdown catch and another 63-yard touchdown pass to D.K. Metcalf.

Ole Miss isn't eligible for a bowl game because of a self-imposed postseason ban related to an NCAA infractions case that continues to hover over the program. The Rebels also lost head coach Hugh Freeze when he resigned during the summer after a school investigation into his phone records .

President Trump on Monday revived his favorite nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- “Pocahontas” -- during a White House event to honor Navajo code talkers.

The president hosted the event to honor the veterans who used their native language during World Wars I and II to protect the U.S. during battle.

“You’re very, very special people. You were here long before any of us were here,” Trump said in the Oval Office. But his comments took an unexpected turn—to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts.

“Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas,” Trump said. “But you know what? I like you. Because you are special.”

Trump has repeatedly mocked Warren for claims she has made about being part Native American.

Heavy snow in Germany is being blamed for two deaths, several accidents and dozens of canceled airline flights.

On Sept. 28, 2008, in a scene that millions of viewers of the “American Chopper” reality TV show watched on Discovery Channel, my father booted me from the Orange County Choppers custom motorcycle-building company, of which I was part-owner.

We had plenty of blowups during filming – and, truthfully, for years before Discovery placed our combustible, dysfunctional relationship on television for the world to see. That day might not have even been our biggest argument. But it was the most significant.

And that turned out to be one of the best things that could have happened to me at the time. It just took a while to realize that.

Not until I got out from under my dad’s controlling nature and formed my own company – Paul Jr. Designs – could I see how oppressive of an environment I worked in with my dad.

Not until I got out from under my dad’s controlling nature and formed my own company – Paul Jr. Designs – could I see how oppressive of an environment I worked in with my dad.

I was almost 34 years old when he fired me. Ultimately, I think my father canned me for financial reasons. I had recently become part-owner of Orange County Choppers with a growing percentage of the company coming my way. I am convinced that my father wanted me to come back for less money. But I wouldn’t.

By contract, I could not build motorcycles for one year after we separated. Still, I was able to start Paul Jr. Designs and provide design services for different companies.

Creating my own business and venturing into new areas of design was scary. I had been one of the two main faces of Orange County Choppers, along with my father. Then one shouting match and a couple of slammed doors later, that association was gone. I entered into one of the most uncertain times in my life.

The year away from building bikes helped me. Working with my father had become such a negative – it was a toxic environment – that I lost the joy of building motorcycles.

Filming “American Chopper” had grown tiresome. But leaving Orange County Choppers allowed me to create my own positive environment. My level of creativity took off. I matured as a man. For the first time, I could see what others had tried to tell me: My relationship with my father was unhealthy.

“American Chopper” became fun again. My passion for designing motorcycles resurfaced. And when I returned to building bikes after the one-year non-compete agreement had expired, I started producing some of the best bikes I’ve ever made.

I still hope my father and I can enjoy a normal father-son relationship, and we are giving “American Chopper” another spin for a return to Discovery. I hope it enables us to reconcile our relationship. We both want to make it work.

I love my father. I always have. The business risks he took created the path for me to discover my God-given gift of custom-building cool motorcycles.

“While we are proud of our longstanding commitment to equality and diversity — from the team members we hire to the communities we serve — discrimination and implicit bias sometimes create outcomes that are less than ideal for many of our team members and customers,” American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said in a statement on Thursday.

Parker outlined a four-part approach: implementing company-wide implicit bias training, conducting diversity and inclusion analysis, improving internal oversight, and revamping their discrimination claims process.

The changes in policy come after the second meeting with the NAACP following an October incident in which a prominent African-American activist claimed she was removed from an American Airlines flight because of her race.

Tamika Mallory, an activist and one of the co-chairs of the Women's March, was kicked off a flight to New York in October following a dispute with a gate agent over her seat assignment. After the dispute was seemingly resolved, a white male pilot had her removed from the plane when she had already boarded. She recounted in a tearful Facebook video how several security officers escorted her and a companion off the plane.

Following the incident, the NAACP issued a travel advisory October 24 warning African Americans about their safety when flying on American Airlines. The civil rights group cited other incidents in addition to Mallory’s case, calling the situation a “pattern of disturbing incidents.”

Leadership from NAACP congratulated the airline on the change but said the organization would not reverse its travel advisory until it saw significant change.

“This is a good start to changing internal processes that allow for discrimination, racism and implicit bias to continue to exist within companies,” said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson in a statement. “We think that the steps taken by American Airlines, if fully implemented, will not only change the way they engage their customers and employees but will serve as a model for other companies.”

Ira Dube, a Navy veteran living in Colorado, told Fox News he’s been searching for the families of veterans who served with his late father, Sgt. Stanley Dube, in what he said was the 27th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army National Guard, 108th Infantry Regiment, in the 1940s.

Dube believes the portraits are of men who served in the 105th Infantry Regiment.

His search began in January 2017, after he found the portraits — of 17 different servicemen — in his sister’s attic.

The artwork, Dube said, is a way for the descendants of these American veterans to be able to “see how my dad saw their hero through his eyes.”

Three of the 17 drawings had identifying information on them — signatures of the men drawn.

He took the minimal information that he had to the internet, and, “totally out of the blue,” he discovered relatives of Joseph “Joner” Kratky — a soldier who was killed in action in June of 1944 in Saipan — who were “amazed” at the drawing.

Dube was also able to connect with the family of Joe “Solid Jackson” Orbe.

When he sent Orbe’s family the artwork, he included a note to the late soldier’s young granddaughter, saying: “Know your grandfather was a hero during a very difficult time in our country,” according to WPIX.

A third portrait, Dube said, had the last name ""Reid"" written on it. He was unable to read the first name.

“I keep going on to the sites, looking at pictures, trying to match sketches to those pictures,” Dube told Fox 21.

Dube told Fox News he believes the men in the drawings “were closer” to his father “as friends than maybe as comrades,” and thinks many of them are from New York or New Jersey.

He added that his father, while he didn’t speak much about his time in the war — “I don’t think anybody really did when they came back” — was always drawing or painting.

Throughout his many moves in life, whether it was to a new house or to a retirement community, Dube said it was “just amazing that my dad had kept them as many times as he moved during the decades.”

“They had to have a meaning in them,” he added of the artwork. Dube said Stanley continued to work on his art — even after suffering strokes — until his 80s. He passed away at 90 years old in 2009.

Dube has sent the artwork to the New York State Military Museum, which is eager to help find the family members of those pictured, he said.

“I want to return these sketches to these families,” Dube told PIX. “I’m sending the love he put into it.”

Those with information on the artwork can contact Ira Dube on Facebook or contact Jim Gandy, of the New York State Military Museum’s research center, at 518-581-5109.

Nashville’s Tennessean newspaper reports that Campbell’s 13-page will, dated Sept. 1, 2006, excludes Campbell’s daughter Kelli and sons William Travis and Wesley Kane from benefitting directly from his estate. Campbell was married a total of four times and fathered eight children; the three children excluded from his estate are all from his marriage to his second wife, Billie Jean Nunley, which ended in divorce in 1976.

Prior to that, Campbell was married to Diane Kirk from 1955-1959, a marriage which resulted in his eldest daughter, Debby. Campbell married Mac Davis’ ex-wife, Sarah Barg, in September 1976. The couple had one child named Dillon and divorced in 1980, and after a high-profile relationship with Tanya Tucker, Campbell married Kim Woollen in 1982. They had three children together, Cal, Shannon, and Ashley.

Documents filed in Davidson County Probate Court in Nashville name Kim Campbell as the executor of Campbell’s estimated $50 million estate. The court filing specifically excludes Kelli, William Travis and Wesley Kane from any direct benefit not only from Campbell’s estate, but also a related trust. A hearing on the filing is set for Jan. 18, 2018, which could set the stage for a protracted legal battle over the terms of the will.

Campbell died on Aug. 8, 2017, after battling Alzheimer’s since 2011. His oldest children, Debby and Travis, previously won a legal victory after claiming that Kim Campbell was denying them the right to visit their father during his illness. In May of 2016, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed a bill into law called the Campbell / Falk Act. The law allows family members and close friends of a person with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia or other disabilities to visit a loved one in person, or maintain contact with them by phone, email or mail, despite the stated wishes of a legally appointed conservator.",Glen Campbell's will doesn't include three of his eight children,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/30/glen-campbells-will-doesnt-include-three-his-eight-children.html

That's what I thought of when I heard the news of Matt Lauer's firing.
But to me there's a different lesson to be learned, and that is this:We are all expendable at work.
But most of work is just work, and a job can lose its luster.
When we lose our job for whatever reason—health problems, being fired or let go—we can usually get another one.","Personally, I've never been more proud of having made my family, my relationships, the focus of my life instead of my career. It wasn't easy going against the grain all those years, but it has made all the difference.

That's what I thought of when I heard the news of Matt Lauer's firing. I didn't think, ""Oh, that skunk."" Or, ""There goes another sexual predator."" No, what I thought was that ""inappropriate sexual behavior"" can mean anything. Literally, anything.

I'm not suggesting Lauer is innocent; but as he has now intimated, there's more to the story than meets the eye.

There always is.

One of the reasons he was fired is that it's easier for companies to fire people than it is to deal with the legal costs and loss of reputation that would ensue if the employee stayed.

Nevertheless, you will now hear an earful from writers and pundits about how terrible men are at their core. But to me there's a different lesson to be learned, and that is this:

We are all expendable at work. Every single one of us.

At the end of the day, a job is just a job—while at home we are irreplaceable. That's why getting the family thing down is critical, and why our lives should reflect that. Careers are, or should be, the side dish.

Sadly, that is not how we operate. Instead our culture hails work as the be all, end all—especially for women. And what do women do in response? They spend at least a decade, usually more, on their educations and career. They get tunnel vision. They believe their life's purpose will be work and thus ignore the weight of marriage and family, often until it's too late.

But careers can change. Yes, they can be rewarding. But most of work is just work, and a job can lose its luster. Or it can come to an abrupt end as it has for Matt Lauer.

And if we lose our job, one hopes to have a rock solid family to fall back on. (Something tells me that will not be the case with Lauer.) When we lose our job for whatever reason—health problems, being fired or let go—we can usually get another one. We can't say that about family. If our marriage and family breaks down, we can't just go out and create a new one.

Doesn't it make more sense, then, to make family, not work, the focus?

If you have grown children who are just beginning to map out their lives, why not use Lauer's story to teach the valuable lesson that it doesn't matter how rich or popular or successful you are in the world outside your doorstep, there will always be people who want to drag you down.

The cultural landscape is bleak. Men and women are finding it harder than ever to make love work.

Children too are suffering. As Erica Komisar writes in her new book ""Being There,"" ""Young women who have been pushed their entire lives to achieve at a high level tell me that if they step off the corporate ladder, they can never get back on at the same level. That’s true; you may never be the CEO of the bank or corporate law firm if you choose to make your family your first priority. But you may not have emotionally healthy children or have a close relationship with your children now or when they’re adults if you make your career your first priority.""

We know these things, yet we continue to talk about and emphasize work.

Work has become our drug of choice: it anesthetizes the fact that our relationships aren’t working.

So tell your kids not to make work the center of their lives—their raison d'être. Encourage them instead to focus on family. On choosing the right spouse and making good decisions where their relationships at home are concerned.

It's the best investment they'll ever make.",Suzanne Venker: Lauer's firing teaches us that everyone is replaceable at work. That's why THIS matters,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/01/suzanne-venker-lauers-firing-teaches-us-that-everyone-is-replaceable-at-work-thats-why-this-matters.html

In its review of recidivism by criminal illegal immigrants, the paper looked at 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012.","The disturbing verdict in the killing of Kate Steinle – finding a criminal illegal alien not guilty of the most serious charges for her death – illustrates the need to find a way to end the “sanctuary cities” movement that has spread around the nation.

Steinle was only 32 when she was shot and killed in July 2015 by a bullet fired by illegal alien Jose Ines Garcia Garcia Zarate, who had a record of seven felony convictions and five previous deportations. Garcia Zarate did not deny shooting Steinle, but said it was an accident.

Garcia Zarate had been freed by San Francisco authorities three months before he shot Steinle, despite a federal immigration detention request to hold him so federal officials could take him into custody.

Now Garcia Zarate is, for the eighth time, a convicted felon – but he was found guilty Thursday of only illegal possession of a weapon. He was acquitted on the more serious charges of first- and second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and assault with a semi-automatic weapon.

Courtesy of American justice, Garcia Zarate had the full benefit of the due process of law conferred on American citizens – legal counsel at every step of the proceedings, an attentive judge, a jury of his peers, and the expectation that the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Steinle had none of those protections as she stood over the San Francisco Bay with her father, who would know her pleas for help as the last thing he’d ever hear her utter in a too-short life.

The case involving the young woman’s killing has spurred intense debate, Trump administration warnings to suspected sanctuary jurisdictions, lawsuits and proposed legislation on how U.S. immigration enforcement might proceed.

President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice have weighed in, proposing dramatically different immigration enforcement schemes than their predecessors.

The political left has staked out its position on immigration. An estimated 300 jurisdictions large and small have sanctuary policies that work to defeat cooperation by local law enforcement with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The federal agency describes its mission as enforcing “federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety.”

The sanctuary jurisdictions create opportunities for further harm, just like that posed by Steinle’s killer. Their claim is that sanctuary cities are actually as safe as or safer than others, with illegal residents less likely to break the law and more likely to cooperate with law enforcement when real crimes occur.

And sanctuary jurisdictions argue that immigration enforcement is the province of the federal government and they have no desire or intention of acting as agents or holding facilities for the feds.

But sanctuary supporters conveniently ignore the fact that disregarding an ICE detainer request and setting an illegal alien criminal free creates a very real threat that the criminal will commit crimes harming innocent victims in the future.

Kate Steinle’s tragic case is but one in a sea of unnecessary tears.

Earlier this year, The Washington Times reported on a Center for Immigration Studies analysis that found that from January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015, more than 17,000 ICE detainer requests were rejected by sanctuary jurisdictions.

Of those rejected requests, almost 70 percent were issued for individuals with a prior criminal history. That’s over 10,000 likely and confirmed criminal illegal aliens who ignored U.S. immigration law in how they came to be in this country, allegedly engaged in additional criminal conduct while here, and were returned to the streets rather than handed off to ICE.

This action, the left would have us believe, makes us safer rather than less safe. Over 10,000 times safer, if you follow the logic.

But there are holes in the logic. In reporting by the Boston Globe last year, the paper challenged statements by an Obama-era ICE director who was responsible for managing spin as the besieged agency itself released criminal illegal aliens inside U.S. borders.

In its review of recidivism by criminal illegal immigrants, the paper looked at 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012. It found as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation.

Last summer, police in Santa Rosa, California arrested 38-year-old Nery Israel Estrada-Margos for allegedly beating his girlfriend to death. Estrada-Margos had been in police custody before the murder for felony domestic battery charges after he allegedly beat his girlfriend following an argument.

Despite an ICE detainer request, police released Estrada-Margos from custody after he posted bail. Disingenuously claiming they tried to honor the ICE detainer request, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office released the suspected killer 16 minutes after notifying ICE, which was 60 miles away, of the pending release.

Veronica Cabrera Ramirez, Estrada-Margos’ girlfriend, didn’t have a voice in the sanctuary city debate. Her state is more interested in protecting people like Estrada-Margos from ICE than protecting her. It failed her and it is knowingly and intentionally failing others.

The stories of Kate Steinle and Veronica Cabrera Ramirez will fade with the passage of time. But theirs will simply be replaced by the stories of future victims of heinous and predictable crimes committed by criminal illegal aliens who take advantage of American kindness and weakness.

As we endure yet another “national conversation” – this one on border security and immigration – hundreds or perhaps thousands of new victims will fall prey to criminal illegal aliens upon whose intentions too many local jurisdictions and some states will place a losing bet.

In a Nov. 22 editorial, The Washington Post called Attorney General Sessions’ battle against sanctuary cities “pointless.” For Kate, Veronica and all those future victims of criminal illegal aliens, it’s anything but.",Kate Steinle's tragic death shows why the 'sanctuary cities' movement threatens the safety of all Americans,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/12/03/kate-steinles-tragic-death-shows-why-sanctuary-cities-movement-threatens-safety-all-americans.html

People who see standing for the national anthem as a non-negotiable way of paying respect to veterans have been feuding with those who support the rights of NFL players to protest racial injustice and police brutality during the anthem.

The Bob Woodruff Foundation, where I serve as executive director, is a manifestly nonpartisan organization. Operating this way has allowed us to successfully invest more than $45 million in finding, funding and shaping programs that empower veterans, service members and their families across the country.

However, outrage over the national anthem is an item we felt we needed to examine more carefully. The issue has thrust veterans, and respect for them, into the public discourse. We would be remiss not to take the country’s pulse on the subject.

Our commitment to veterans has long strengthened our country and reinforced the values of our communities, and it can continue to bind us moving forward.

In a survey we fielded in November to 800 Americans ages 18 and up, the statement “veterans make this country great” was the most readily agreed upon of the statements we put forth.

In fact, 74 percent of respondents agreed, and only 10 percent disagreed. Levels of agreement were consistent across regions, with 75 percent agreement in the South, 74 percent in the Center-Great Lakes and 73 percent in both the East and the West regions.

If anything, the dialogue around the NFL protests may have heightened Americans’ awareness of our responsibility to respect those who serve in the military. Across the total sample, 55 percent agreed with this assessment. Further, 56 percent of respondents said that media coverage of Gold Star families has increased their awareness of what military sacrifice means.

This common ground is worth our attention, especially as we approach the clean slate of 2018. Our commitment to veterans has long strengthened our country and reinforced the values of our communities, and it can continue to bind us moving forward.

Our survey also revealed another area of agreement among Americans across all regions, age groups, city sizes and levels of education: On the question of whether the U.S. government is doing enough to serve wounded veterans, more than eight in 10 Americans were unified in their belief that it’s not.

At the Bob Woodruff Foundation, we aim to complement the government’s efforts to tackle the tough challenges that injured veterans and their families can face. This includes dedicating funds and resources to address the critical shortage of mental health-care providers serving the military and veteran population.

This need was very painfully reinforced recently when a former U.S. Air Force member murdered much of the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

According to the RAND Center for Military Health Policy Research, approximately 18.5 percent of U.S. service members who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. And 19.5 percent report experiencing a traumatic brain injury during deployment.

While it’s still unclear exactly how his time as a service member impacted the Texas gunman, we do know that Americans are looking for ways to help and to come together after yet another deeply felt and shared tragedy.

Macy’s Studio is the team in charge of, well, just about everything related to the annual parade, from designing the floats (five this year) and transporting them to Manhattan from the studio's New Jersey headquarters, to even hand-painting the high-flying balloons.

Those balloons, too, have been a staple of the parade since 1927, when Macy’s introduced Felix the Cat and decided to stop using live animals borrowed from the Central Park Zoo. They didn't contain helium either, so handlers held them up with sticks.

Nine decades later, helium isn’t the only thing that’s changed.

SINGLE DAUGHTER’S HILARIOUS CHRISTMAS CARD GOES VIRAL

Apparently, there were two reasons for the funny ploy. Green, a sneakerhead and owner of Fit Factory Houston, told Yahoo Lifestyle that he took off his shoe to buy some time, as some members of the family were running late en route to the proposal. But he also removed the sneaker because his Jordans were especially valuable: A pair of 2018 Concords retail for $450, and the resale value drops once they’re creased.

In fact, Green says he made another big purchase the same day he got the shoes.

“I got the [engagement] ring at 12 noon and was going to hold it for a little while, [but] maybe around 3 p.m., I said meet me here at 7,” Green said, recalling how he got his shoes, a ring and a bride-to-be all within a few hours. “I got the shoes first and then got the ring.”

While the shape of the German automaker’s luxury four-door coupe hasn’t changed much in this all-new version, under the hood things are very different.

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS marks the return of an inline-six-cylinder engine to the Mercedes lineup, now with electric assist. Mercedes notes that it is the first vehicle in its lineup with a starter-generator integrated into its 9-speed transmission that gives the 362-horsepower 3.0-liter motor an extra 21 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque in short bursts.

Many upgrades to the CLS can be found also in the interior, which can now seat five passengers. Those inside will be treated with many comforting features such as ambient lighting, illuminated air vents, a 12.3-inch high-resolution central display, wireless smartphone charging, and a fully digital dash. If one monitor isn't enough, a dual set of displays combined under one piece of glass to create even more of a cockpit feel is optional. And, if you're feeling a certain way, you can use Mercedes' Energizing Comfort program, which links the functions of the climate control system, fragrance, lighting and music to tailor to one of six different moods.

To keep its passengers safe as well as comfortable, the new CLS offers a host of technologies, including an automatic emergency braking system and a feature called Pre Safe Sound that emits a signal to help protect their eardrums from the high pressure noises that often accompany a collision.

A semi-autonomous Driver Assistance Package that allows the CLS to steer itself within a lane and even change lanes when the driver hits the turn signal is also available, along with a set of adjustable air springs that improve ride and handling regardless of who is in control.

But the holidays are also hectic, and technology affects every aspect of our winter existence. We shop online. We book e-tickets. We download recipes and exchange digital cards. Gadgets and apps can help streamline our holiday experience, but they can also complicate matters, or even give us a false sense of security.

To make your family plans as cheerful as possible, here are five digital tricks for the tech-savvy celebrant.

1. Keep spies out of your holiday rental

December is one of the busiest times of the year for travel, and millions of Americans will find themselves in hotels, family homes and rentals. This might be a ski lodge in the Adirondacks. It might be a cheap motel in the middle of a long road trip.

As cameras shrink and lodging gets more informal, you’d be forgiven for worrying about spies. There are plenty of weirdos out there, and they now have the technology to watch you in your room. So how do you protect yourself from secret surveillance?

Use your senses: Many devices emit a low-level hum you may hear when the room is completely quiet. Many cameras have tiny lights you may see when the room is dark.

Use a signal detector: Designed to pick up the signal from a hidden camera, these devices are about the size of a small walkie-talkie and are often equipped with infrared lights. You can sweep them across the room to catch pinhole cameras. Click here for more about signal detectors.

Use your cellphone: When you make a call near a recorder, the device’s frequency may interfere with your signal. If all else fails, you can call someone and walk around the room, listening for a significant crackle or delay. Not sure what you’re looking for? Click here for 10 types of spy cameras that could be watching you right now.

2. Stock up on movies for the road

Thanks to tablets and smartphones, we are no longer at the mercy of an airline’s cinematic selection. Once you hit cruising altitude, you can pull out your device and start watching. Better yet, you can download films for cheap, thanks to an ever-growing library of downloadable content. Click here to manage all your streaming services without going insane.

Netflix: The original streaming service once vowed never to make films available for download, but it’s recently changed its tune. Just install the free Netflix app, and you’ll find thousands of movies and TV series available. With a decent Wi-Fi signal, the download is shockingly fast.

Amazon: Anyone can install the Amazon Video app and start watching films they’ve purchased, but the real gold mine comes with Amazon Prime, which allows you to save content with the same ease and selection as Netflix.

Vimeo on Demand: If you’re weary of the same big-budget features, you’ll find zillions of obscure flicks and docs on Vimeo, the premiere platform for independent filmmakers. Just like mainstream services, you’ll need the Vimeo app to save your selections, but you’ll be amazed how much diversity is out there.

3. Destroy old hard drives before upgrading

Christmas is the perfect time to give and receive a new computer. Most new models have been released, and holiday discounts are everywhere. You’ll find doorbuster sales on laptops, desktops and tablets, which are timely if you’ve looking to upgrade.

But in the middle of the Christmas Day frenzy, you may forget to dispose of your old hard drive properly. Take my advice: Don’t get sloppy and toss your computer in the dumpster. It may be password protected, and the machine may languish in the city dump, but you never know who might dig your device out of the rubbish and hack into it, accessing all your private information.

The most cathartic method is to physically rip open the computer and smash the circuits and drive to bits with a hammer. This works, and it’s appropriate for computers that are too old to reuse, but there are slightly more civilized techniques you can use.

There’s the wrong way and the “write” way to delete files for good. Click here for the step-by-step instructions.

4. Get the details on HDR

If you’re in the market for a new television, you’ve probably heard a lot of chatter about HDR. But what is it? Is that like HD? 4K? Is it worth investing in?

HDR stands for “high dynamic range.” When it comes to visuals, HDR is basically about the range of light and dark. It promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a wider gamut of colors. So, theoretically, an HDR video played on an HDR-compatible television would look sharper, more detailed and more lifelike than on a non-HDR version.

Click here for one essential setting to get the clearest image on your smart TV.

HDR for television: At this particular moment, HDR is new and there isn’t a lot of content available. But media companies are clamoring to catch up, so you won’t have to wait too long for your HDR TV to pay off.

HDR for phones: The iPhone X is HDR compatible, which is exciting. But unless you have other motivations for buying an iPhone X (and there are many mind-blowing properties), it’s probably too early to buy a phone just for its HDR capabilities.

5. Let Google Maps guide your sleigh

GPS is a miraculous thing, especially when we’re driving complicated routes through unfamiliar cities. Google Maps has transformed the way people get around, and there are other mapping services (like Waze) that offer their own spin on navigation technology.

But Google Maps has tons of features that semi-regular users never think to access. You may think to enter your home address into the app for easy reference, but did you know you can pre-select pit-stops on longer trips? Did you know you can instantly retrace where you’ve been, whether you were using GPS or not? Did you know you can use Google Maps offline? There are too many tips and tricks to list in this post, so click here for 12 Google Maps tricks you’ll use time and time again.

Bonus: Score cheap flights on Google Flight

Suddenly it’s mid-December, and you realize you still haven’t booked a transnational flight. How will you ever get from one coast to the other without spending your entire New Year’s bonus?

If you still have time, Google Flights will let you set alerts, so you can monitor fluctuating prices for a couple of days before pressing the button. If you’re taking the whole week off, you can choose “flexible dates,” which may land you a better price. No matter how you book on Google Flights, the software will point out both the cheapest flight and the best-quality flight, so you may be able to skip those headache-inducing red-eyes.

By L. Brent Bozell III, Fox News



So the top broadcast news journalist who raked the former top cable news journalist over sexual harassment has now been fired for sexual harassment. You can’t make this stuff up. Matt Lauer’s canned. As I write these words there is only a report from Variety that describes his alleged indiscretions, but one thing is for certain: NBC would not have fired their top star were this not an impeachable offense.

They’re dropping like bowling pins all over Hollywood, in sports, in politics and in journalism. Every day someone new is guilty of sexual harassment. While the deed is being reported, what is being swept under the rug is the raging hypocrisy.

There is no better example of the cynical mind at work than evidenced by these questions from Lauer to Bill O’Reilly during their Today Show interview on September 19.

He wanted O’Reilly to know what a lout he was: “[O’Reilly’s accusers] came forward and filed complaints against the biggest star at the network they worked at. Think of how intimidating that must have been, how nerve-racking that must have been! Doesn’t that tell you how strongly they felt about the way they were treated by you?”

He wanted to know if O’Reilly was truly repentant: “Over the last six months since your firing, have you done some soul searching? Have you done some self-reflection? And have you looked at the way you treated women that you think now or think about differently now than you did at the time?”

And then there was the topper: “You were probably the last guy in the world that they wanted to fire because you were the guy that the ratings and the revenues were built on, you carried that network on your shoulders for a lot of years. So doesn’t it seem safe to assume that the people at Fox News were given a piece of information or given some evidence that simply made it impossible for you to stay on at Fox News?”

How could Matt Lauer make these solemn pronouncements on national television with a straight face?

In a way he’s no different from Al Franken, or Harvey Weinstein, or Charlie Rose, or Bill Clinton, or Garrison Keillor or all those other liberals who publicly champion the rights of women at every opportunity while looking for every opportunity privately to torment them. It is as if they believe they are on ethical high ground.",Bozell: Matt Lauer and the Sexual Harassment Hypocrisy,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/30/bozell-matt-lauer-and-sexual-harassment-hypocrisy
