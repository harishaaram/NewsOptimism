In a letter to departmental permanent secretaries, the director of the UK National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin, said Russian-made anti-virus software should not be used in systems containing information that would harm national security if it was accessed by the Russian government.

He said his agency is in talks with Kaspersky Lab to develop a system for reviewing its products for use in Britain.

Kaspersky’s anti-virus software was banned from U.S. government networks earlier this year on concerns the company has close ties to intelligence agencies in Moscow and that its software could be used to enable Russian spying.

”We are in discussions with Kaspersky Lab ... about whether we can develop a framework that we and others can independently verify,” Martin said in the letter, which was publicly released.

Kaspersky Lab said in a statement that it looked forward to working with the NCSC on the issue.

Kaspersky has strongly denied allegations about the safety of its products or ties to the Russian government, saying it has become a scapegoat in the midst of rising tensions between Washington and Moscow.

British bank Barclays [BARCR.UL] said on Saturday it had stopped offering Kaspersky anti-virus products to customers.

The Irish border, which will be the only land link between the EU and Britain after Brexit, is proving to be one of the most problematic issues in a slow diplomatic process which is testing the patience of politicians, businesses and investors.

The EU is looking to Britain to provide a solution on how to manage the flow of goods between Ireland and the British province without erecting politically inflammatory border controls.

Britain has said it wants to withdraw from the EU’s customs union, within which goods can move freely, but will not contemplate border posts or other infrastructure that could disrupt 20 years of delicate peace in Northern Ireland.

“We cannot at present see how leaving the customs union and the single market can be reconciled with there being no border or infrastructure,” said opposition lawmaker Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee which is scrutinising the negotiations.

The British government has said it is seeking a flexible and imaginative approach to the border that goes beyond existing EU precedents, and has mooted technological solutions or a new form of customs union. But ministers have been criticised by their counterparts in Ireland for a lack of detail.

Progress on the border issue is crucial to Britain’s hopes of moving negotiations on to the subject of trade and future relations - something businesses are impatient to find out about as they contemplate the need to relocate.

Deputy Irish Prime Minister Simon Coveney said on Thursday that “significantly more clarity” was needed before a Dec. 14-15 summit which could agree the start of ‘phase two’ talks on trade.

The committee, which based its report on evidence from Brexit minister David Davis, also said the government needed to publish more detail on both its short-term plans for a post-departure transition period, and its long-term vision of a future trading relationship with Europe.

”If phase two of the talks do start next month, then ministers need to move beyond words like ‘bespoke’ and ‘special’ and actually explain what it is they are seeking,” Benn said.",UK MPs cast doubt on plan to avoid Ireland border after Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland/uk-mps-cast-doubt-on-plan-to-avoid-ireland-border-after-brexit-idUKKBN1DV3A9

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

In a legal notice sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, Nissan sought payment of incentives due from the Tamil Nadu government as part of a 2008 agreement to set up a car manufacturing plant in the southern state.

According to the notice, Nissan said repeated requests to state officials for the payment, due in 2015, were overlooked and even a plea by the company’s chairman, Carlos Ghosn, to Modi in March of last year seeking federal assistance did not yield any results.

The notice, sent by Nissan’s lawyers in July 2016, was followed by more than a dozen meetings between federal and state officials and Nissan executives, said the person familiar with the matter, who did not want to be named as it is not public.

The federal officials, from several ministries, assured Nissan the payment would be made, and it should not bring a legal case. But, in August, Nissan gave India an ultimatum to appoint an arbitrator, the person said, adding the first arbitration hearing will be in mid-December.

A Nissan spokesman said the company was “committed to working with the government of India toward a resolution,” but did not elaborate.

A senior Tamil Nadu state official said the government hoped to resolve the dispute without having to go to international arbitration. “There is no discrepancy with regard to the amount due, and we are trying hard to resolve the issue,” the official told Reuters.

Modi’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The case, brought against India for alleged violations of its Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan, is the latest in a string of international arbitration proceedings against the country by investors concerned about issues ranging from retrospective taxation to payments disputes.

There are over 20 cases pending against India, among the highest against any single nation.

The dispute between Nissan and the Tamil Nadu government also shows the challenges companies face in India and how local disputes could undermine the Modi government’s efforts to attract foreign investment and create new jobs.

GROWING LOSSES

Several automakers, including Ford (F.N) and Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), have set up production hubs in Tamil Nadu, giving state capital Chennai the nickname; the ‘Detroit of South Asia’.

In 2008, when Nissan and its global alliance partner, French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA), agreed to invest in setting up a car plant in Chennai, the state government promised several incentives including some tax refunds.

Over seven years, Nissan and Renault invested 61 billion rupees ($946 million) and set up a plant with annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles, which entitled them to receive the incentives in 2015, according to the legal notice.

In that notice, Nissan’s lawyers said the state government’s decision to not pay was “arbitrary”, and Nissan has “incurred significant and increasing losses”.

Nissan did not specify the business impact in the 8-page notice, but said in 2008 that state incentives were critical to the project’s viability and sustainability.

The carmaker, in its notice, is claiming 29 billion rupees in unpaid incentives and 21 billion rupees in damages, plus interest and other costs.

Nissan, which has less than a 2 percent share of India’s passenger car market, builds and sells the Micra hatchback, Sunny sedan and Terrano sport-utility vehicle. It also sells low-cost cars under its Datsun brand.

The company spokesman said Nissan has created more than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs in India.

The International Court of Arbitration ruled earlier this week that BlackBerry had failed to make certain payments to Nokia under a patent licence contract, BlackBerry said on Friday.

The ruling, in a previously undisclosed disagreement over a smartphone technology licensing deal signed in 2012, highlights the financial risks technology companies face from disputes over intellectual property, which are sometimes resolved through confidential arbitration processes unknown to investors.

BlackBerry won a $940 million payout from chipmaker Qualcomm Inc earlier this year in a similar case of disputed payments.

BlackBerry has previously said it is looking to generate more revenue from its portfolio of some 40,000 patents by licensing them to other technology companies, and in November said that U.S.-based Marconi Group would help it license out a broad range of its patents.

It is often difficult for investors to value a company’s patent portfolio given the opaque nature of licensing deals and disputes.

“Patent issues are going to come up from time to time and as one-offs,” said Todd Coupland, an analyst at CIBC World Markets. “Getting in front of them, unless there is some detail, is going to be tough.”

BlackBerry shares were down 1.9 percent in midday Toronto trading, Nokia closed 2 percent lower in Helsinki.

BlackBerry disclosed in February that it had filed separate patent infringement complaints against Nokia, alleging that several of the Finnish network equipment maker’s base stations and related software infringed on 11 of its patents.

Nokia, which sells these products to telecom operators, said in a statement on Friday that it believes those infringement claims “are without merit.”

BlackBerry said it would take a GAAP charge on its results, but did not say when the ruling would hit its financials.

Nokia said a significant portion of the amount awarded had already been recognised in its financials.

Nokia sold its once-dominant phone business in 2014, sticking to its network equipment business and broad patent portfolio.

By Salvador Rodriguez

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday announced its adoption of Kubernetes, a popular open-source technology, in a sign of increased competition in the cloud computing business, which Amazon Web Services has long dominated.

Kubernetes has emerged as a standard among companies as they build more applications on public clouds, the big computer data centers that are displacing traditional customer-owned computer systems.

Earlier this year companies including Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp announced their support for Kubernetes, which was originally developed by a team at Google.

AWS Chief Executive Andy Jassy made the Kubernetes announcement at Re:Invent, AWS’s annual conference in Las Vegas which this year attracted more than 40,000 attendees. Amazon also announced a marketing deal with the U.S. National Football League and a flurry of other AWS features, including machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.

One of Kubernetes’ key advantages is its ability to run an application on any public cloud, including Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet Inc’s Google Cloud Platform, making it easier to migrate from one cloud vendor to another.

Amazon had previously offered a service of its own that was similar to Kubernetes, but the Google technology has established itself as the standard for such so-called “container” technologies and AWS ultimately had little choice but to support it, analysts said.

“This is an example of AWS looking outside of their own world in response to customer need,” said Joe Beda, one of the creators of Kubernetes and the chief technology officer of Heptio, a Seattle startup that builds software around Kubernetes technology.

MICROSOFT, GOOGLE GAIN GROUND

AWS pioneered the cloud computing business in 2006 with a service touted as a quick and easy way for smaller business to get affordable, high-powered computing services. It soon began to catch on among larger companies and continue to grow very rapidly, hitting $4.6 billion in revenue on 42 percent year-over-year growth in the most recent quarter.

But the market has begun to change. Although AWS’s share of the worldwide cloud infrastructure market has increased from 43.8 percent in the first half of 2015 to 45.4 percent in the first half of this year, two of its key rivals have also gained share, according to IDC, the market research firm.

Google Cloud Platform’s slice has grown from 1.7 percent in 2015 to 3.1 percent earlier this year, and more notably, Microsoft Azure’s share has increased from 5.6 percent to 10.3 percent in that time span.

“Amazon is still the clear market leader, but the cloud infrastructure market is massive and there’s room for many players,” said Amit Agarwal, chief product officer of Datadog, a New York startup that lets companies monitor their operations on public clouds.

Under the new deal with the National Football League, AWS will be one of the league’s “official technology providers,” allowing AWS to market its connection to the league and advertise during football broadcasts that it is powering the games’ “Next Gen Stats.”

The price of the deal was not disclosed.

“We’re working with some of the NFL broadcasters to investigate what are the great use cases for how to embed (this partnership) for the fan experience,” Ariel Kelman, AWS vice president of worldwide marketing, told Reuters.

The idea is to market AWS to decision-makers without IT backgrounds, such as the chief executive and chief financial officers, Kelman said.

“Before they didn’t have to do that because they were the only guys in town,” Brett Moss, a senior vice president at Ensono, a Chicago IT services provider, said of the marketing effort. “Not anymore.”",Amazon adopts open cloud technology as competition heats up,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-reinvent-kubernetes/amazon-adopts-open-cloud-technology-as-competition-heats-up-idUSKBN1DT34C

Speaking to reporters aboard the plane returning to Rome from Bangladesh, the pontiff also indicated that he had been firm with Myanmar’s military leaders in private meetings about the need for them to respect the rights of Rohingya refugees.

He also disclosed that he cried when he met a group of Rohingya refugees on Friday in Bangladesh, where he defended their rights by name in an emotional meeting.

“For me, the most important thing is that message gets through, to try to say things one step at a time and listen to the responses,” he said.

“I knew that if in the official speeches I would have used that word, they would have closed the door in our faces. But (in public) I described situations, rights, said that no one should be excluded, (the right to) citizenship, in order to allow myself to go further in the private meetings,” he said.

Francis did not use the word Rohingya in public while on the first leg of the trip in Myanmar. Predominantly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the mostly Muslim Rohingya as an ethnic group with its own identity but as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Local Roman Catholic Church authorities had advised him not to say it because it could spark a backlash against Christians and other minority groups.

The pope met Myanmar’s military leaders privately on Monday, shortly after his arrival in the nation’s biggest city, Yangon.

The meeting had been scheduled for Thursday morning but the military pointedly asked at the last minute that it be pushed forward. The result was they saw the pope before the civilian leaders instead of the other way around, as had been planned.

NON-NEGOTIABLE TRUTHS

“It was a good conversation and the truth was non-negotiable,” he said of his meeting with the military leaders.

The latest exodus from Myanmar to Bangladesh of about 625,000 people followed a Myanmar military crackdown in response to Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on Aug. 25.

Refugees have said scores of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, people were killed and women were raped. The military have denied accusations of ethnic cleansing by the United States and United Nations.

Asked if he used the word Rohingya during the private meeting with the military chiefs, the pope said: “I used words in order to arrive at the message and when I saw that the message had arrived, I dared to say everything that I wanted say”.

Slideshow (2 Images)

He then gave a reporter a mischievous grin and ended his answer with the Latin phrase “Intelligenti Pauca,” which means “Few words are enough for those who understand,” strongly hinting that he had used the word the military detests while in their presence.

Human rights groups have criticized the country’s de facto civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who was under house arrest for a total of 15 years before the 2015 elections, for not taking a stand against the generals.

But Francis, who met with her privately on Tuesday, appeared to give her the benefit of the doubt because of her delicate relationship with the generals who were once her jailers.

“Myanmar is a nation that is growing politically, in transition,” Francis said in response to a question about Suu Kyi and budding democracy in Myanmar.

“So things have to be viewed through this lens. Myanmar has to be able to look forward to the building of the country”.

On Friday in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, Francis held an emotional encounter with Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and then used the word Rohingya for the first time on the trip, although he had defended them by name twice from the Vatican earlier this year.

He told the crowd where the Rohingya were that God’s presence was within them and they should be respected.

“I was crying and tried to hide it,” Francis said on the plane, recounting how moved he felt when the refugees recounted their ordeals to him.",Pope says his defense of Rohingya got through in Myanmar,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-pope-asia/pope-says-his-defence-of-rohingya-got-through-in-myanmar-idUKKBN1DW0R5?il=0

Investors are looking for tax cuts to help sustain the rally in U.S. stocks. The separate bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

Goldman Sachs strategists in a Nov. 21 note said the likelihood of a U.S. tax overhaul was the biggest contributor to its raised forecasts, noting that tax cuts should boost 2018 S&P 500 earnings per share by 5 percent.

It raised its 2018 earnings per share forecast for S&P 500 companies to $150 from $139, and said that without a tax overhaul, the estimate would be $143.

Ed Hyman, founder and chairman of investment firm Evercore ISI wrote in a Nov. 19 note to clients that “assuming a 20 percent corporate tax rate,” it is forecasting S&P 500 EPS of $150 for next year.

UBS strategists this week estimated that the S&P 500 could see an earnings boost of 6.5 percent if the corporate tax rate falls to 25 percent. It projects a 9.5 percent gain if the rate goes to 20 percent.

“The buy side has largely factored this in,” said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities, which does not put out its own S&P 500 earnings forecast.

“The reality is people don’t really know what this will be at the end of the day, but clearly people think this is a positive that is going to be good for stocks.”

The S&P 500 .SPX is up about 18 percent so far in 2017.

Other firms have yet to factor tax changes into their 2018 profit forecasts, among them Credit Suisse. Wall Street equities analysts, which base their forecasts on guidance from the individual S&P 500 companies, have yet to include the lower tax rate in their estimates.

But market watchers say firms providing their own estimates are making adjustments now and others are likely to follow.

“Analysts on the Street, they’ve been prudent by not providing the benefits to earnings from tax cuts for 2018. Now you’ll see earnings estimates rising,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

The latest forecast for S&P 500 EPS, based on aggregated company estimates for 2018, is $146.19, compared with an estimate of $146.01 from Sept. 1, according to Thomson Reuters’ data.

It may work on a small scale... but it won't be successful on the same industrial scale that is needed for the UK's gas supply. It's fundamentally different in terms of the geology in the subsurface from those basins that work in the United States."" As buried rock moved upwards it created faults, acting as pathways for the gas to escape. While fracking could work on a small local scale, researchers say shale gas reserves have been vastly overestimated. In effect, the UK is 55 million years too late.

The umbrella organization for the world’s central banks gave the warning as investors continue to bask in what it called the “light and warmth” of improving global growth, subdued inflation and soaring stock markets.

Record high debt levels, however, highlight vulnerabilities in the financial system and the scale of this year’s rally in asset prices seems to have increased caution at the Switzerland-based BIS.

“High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy (asset price) valuations,” the head of BIS’s monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said.

“The longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence.”

There was some surprise too that benchmark bond yields - which drive global borrowing costs - have stayed down even with the Federal Reserve now shrinking its balance sheet and the European Central Bank also about to heavily cut its stimulus.

The improving global growth outlook, Japan’s ongoing money printing and the message from both the Fed and ECB that they will tread carefully going forward was the likely explanation for still low yields, though they did raise a “deeper question”.

“Can a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions unambiguously ease? And, if the answer is no, what should central banks do?” Borio said.

The pace of tightening from the likes of the Fed is already expected to be the slowest on record.

One concern is that the continued low bond yields and low market volatility, particularly in the United States, are reminiscent of the bond market “conundrum” referred to by former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in 2005 before the financial crisis.

Yields remained low then too despite a run of U.S. rate hikes and only gained any traction later in the cycle.

“In an era in which gradualism and predictability are becoming the norm, these questions (about effective tightening) are likely to grow more pressing.”

It is especially the case with some stock market gauges now in “frothy” territory.

At recent levels in excess of 30, the U.S. stock market’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), for example, has exceeded its post-1982 average by almost 25 percent.

The dividend payout ratio of U.S. companies is also back at highs observed in the 1970s and so might not go much further. “High valuations: market complacency?” the BIS posed the question, though it said stocks did look much less frothy when measured against extremely low bonds yields.

Speaking to members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus, Erdogan did not say to whom he was referring, nor did he single out a single business, person or country of destination.

His comments come after the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Friday that Turkish prosecutors were set to seize the assets of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in the trial of a Turkish bank executive charged with evading U.S. sanctions on Iran, and his acquaintances.

The trial has caused already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington to deteriorate further as Zarrab detailed in court a scheme to evade the U.S. sanctions, saying that Erdogan personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when prime minister.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

The agreement on a range of often politically sensitive measures - covering fiscal issues, energy and labor market reforms, bad loans and privatizations - could open up fresh loans and push Greece further along the path toward a return to full market financing.

“The institutions’ visit is completed, we closed the staff level agreement,” Greece’s Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters on Saturday.

“The European institutions have reached a staff level agreement with the Greek authorities on the policy package supporting the ESM (European Stability Programme) program,” an EU statement said later on Saturday.

The agreement between Greek officials and European Union and International Monetary Fund representatives on the country’s compliance with reforms and future commitments must be approved by euro zone finance ministers, scheduled to meet on Dec. 4.

Under the deal, Athens will need to implement a broad set of reforms as part of the so-called third review of its bailout program.

Once concluded, the review is expected to release about five billion euros in loans from the current 86-billion-euro bailout program, its third since 2010. EU officials said this could be done before the end of January, if all proceeded smoothly.

At least another review of agreed reforms will be necessary before the end of the program in August.

Athens and its lenders had been exchanging drafts on agreed and proposed reforms for days. After seven years of austerity and rescue loans amounting to about 270 billion euros ($320 billion), Greece hopes its third bailout will be its last.

The government has been keen to swiftly conclude the review, which started in October, to begin talks on debt relief and the terms of the country’s exit from the bailout program.

“The speed with which this deal was reached is a signal that Greece is fully committed to conclude the program,” an EU official told Reuters.

Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion).

The pressure has intensified since French media group Vivendi, TIM’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

Already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington have deteriorated as Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors, detailed in court a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions.

Erdogan said Turkey’s dealings were in line with the decisions of the United Nations, adding that they were not against Ankara’s alliance with Washington.

“What have we done, for example? We bought natural gas from a country we have an agreement with so our citizens wouldn’t be cold in the winter. Like other countries, only the UN’s decisions bind us, and Turkey followed them to the dot,” he told members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus.

Over three days of testimony, Zarrab has implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said on Thursday that when Erdogan was prime minister he had authorized a transaction to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

“This case is nothing more than the 17-25 December plot being carried across the ocean. Excuse us, but we will not succumb to this blackmail,” Erdogan said, referring to 2013 leaks about alleged government corruption which were blamed on his opponents.

Although he has not yet responded to the courtroom claims, Erdogan has dismissed the case as a politically motivated attempt to bring down the Turkish government, led by Gulen.

Turkey has repeatedly requested Gulen’s extradition, but U.S. officials have said the courts require sufficient evidence before they can extradite the elderly cleric, who has denied any involvement in the coup.

Nabors, who later became a star with his own television show “Gomer Pyle, USMC,” died at his home in Hawaii, the website said, citing his office manager.

The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that Nabors had been in declining health for the last few years. He had entered a hospital on Wednesday for tests and asked to be released to go home, his husband Stan Cadwallader told the newspaper.

Nabors’ show business break came in the early 1960s when Andy Griffith saw him in a Los Angeles cabaret - singing in a sophisticated, ear-grabbing voice and telling stories between songs in a Deep South drawl - and offered him a part on “The Andy Griffith Show.”

Griffith’s sitcom - tales of down-home people in a slow-moving Southern town - was one of the most popular on U.S. television at the time and Nabors’ Gomer Pyle character was a hit after joining the cast in 1962.

Gomer was the town’s rustic, kind-hearted gas station attendant who was given to exclamations of “golly” and “shazam” when he was impressed, as well as “surprise, surprise, surprise” and “shame, shame, shame” - depending on the circumstances and stretching each word to several syllables.

After two years on the Griffith show, Nabors was given his own sitcom, “Gomer Pyle, USMC,” with Gomer enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps. It proved to be a viewers’ favorite, sometimes reaching No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings.

As a Marine, Private Pyle was a major screw-up and always at odds with his no-nonsense sergeant. Through it all, he remained pure of heart, sunny of disposition and simple of mind.

After five years of “Gomer Pyle, USMC” Nabors was ready for a different challenge and left the show. His subsequent variety show, “The Jim Nabors Hour,” had a two-year run and he made frequent guest appearances on other television shows.

GOMER STEREOTYPE

Nabors was so strongly identified as Gomer that it limited the roles he was offered. His career was helped along by friend Burt Reynolds, who put him in three of his 1980s movies - “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,” “Stroker Ace” and “Cannonball Run II.”

In 1986 Nabors revived Gomer for the TV movie “Return to Mayberry,” a reunion of “The Andy Griffith Show,” and he kept busy performing in revues, nightclubs and small theaters. Nabors also appeared in several children’s television shows and frequently appeared on friend Carol Burnett’s variety show.

When he wasn’t acting, Nabors was singing in a glorious baritone that made listeners forget all about Gomer Pyle’s hayseed twang. He recorded dozens of albums of country, inspirational and religious music with five of them selling more than 500,000 copies.

Nabors made headlines in January 2013 when he married Cadwallader, a former Honolulu firefighter and his partner of 38 years at that time, in Seattle shortly after the state of Washington made same-sex marriage legal.

Nabors, who moved to Hawaii in the 1980s, told Hawaii News Now that his television colleagues knew he was gay in the 1960s and ‘70s but that he never sought to publicize it because he preferred privacy.

“It’s pretty obvious that we had no rights as a couple, yet when you’ve been together 38 years, I think something’s got to happen there, you’ve got to solidify something,” Nabors said of his marriage. “And at my age, it’s probably the best thing to do.”

Nabors was born June 12, 1930, and grew up in Sylacauga, Alabama, where his father was a police officer. After graduating from the University of Alabama with a business degree, he moved to New York and took a job as a typist at the United Nations. From there, he went to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and worked as a film editor for a television station.

Another film editing job took him to Los Angeles, where he spent off-hours performing at the cabaret where Griffith spotted him.

After the peak of his entertainment career Nabors concentrated on growing macadamia nuts at his farm on the Hawaiian island of Maui.

In February 1994 Nabors suffered from hepatitis B and underwent a liver transplant. He said he contracted the virus several years before in India but it had remained dormant. He underwent heart surgery in June 2012.

Nabors was a fixture at the Indianapolis 500, singing “Back Home Again in Indiana” at the motor race’s opening ceremony more than 35 times.

While Gomer Pyle never rose above the rank of private on television, the Marine Corps made Nabors an honorary Marine with the rank of lance corporal in 2001. He was promoted to full corporal in 2007.","Actor Jim Nabors, TV's 'Gomer Pyle' of 1960s, dies at 87",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-people-nabors-obituary/actor-jim-nabors-tvs-gomer-pyle-of-1960s-dies-at-87-idUKKBN1DU2W1

The Zimbabwe military’s slow-motion, week-long, eviction of the man who has ruled that landlocked southern African state for its entire 37 years of existence as an independent nation, came to an abrupt and almost banal end on Tuesday night. After a week of determined resistance, President Robert Mugabe suddenly folded his hand and resigned with immediate effect, by means of a letter read out in the nation’s Parliament, just as impeachment proceedings were starting.

On a continent that often has been wracked by violent coups d’état, this had been a most unusual military intervention. For different reasons, everyone, on all sides, took pains to avoid any suggestion that this was a coup.

When the tanks last week swept into the capital city of Harare and soldiers took control of key installations, the nature of what had happened seemed simple: a forced change of power, accomplished in this case at the cost of the death of a single ministerial bodyguard, and with the 93-year-old Mugabe and his 52-year-old wife, Grace, placed under house arrest. That’s a textbook coup.

The military’s actions followed within days of Mugabe firing Deputy President Emmerson Mnangagwa, seemingly to clear the way for the widely despised Grace – known disparagingly as Gucci Grace for reports of her profligacy – to succeed him when he eventually relinquished control. Mnangagwa, who bears the nickname of Crocodile for his canny ruthlessness, and who was Mugabe’s lifelong friend and ally, fled to neighboring South Africa.

“We wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover,” were among the first words of Major General SB Moyo in the post-takeover statement read on television to a riveted nation. Rather, the military was targeting “criminals” around President Mugabe “who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country.”

The sensitivity to semantics on the part of the Zimbabwean generals stems from the 55-nation African Union, the continent’s over-arching intergovernmental body, taking an increasingly hard line against illegal changes of government. Alpha Conde, chair of the AU and president of Guinea, was initially forthright on what had happened: the action was “clearly soldiers trying to take power by force” and he warned that the AU would “never accept a coup d’état in Zimbabwe.”

The AU is, however, alert also to the diplomatic fallout that would result from thwarting the popular ousting of a man seen by many Zimbabweans as a despot who has long since lost the luster he acquired while leading a liberation army in the long civil war to end white minority rule. Almost a quarter of Zimbabwe’s 16-million population has in the past decade fled the country as economic and political refugees, the majority of them to South Africa.

The reaction from the populace was at first muted. Perhaps they were scenting the political winds, trying to establish whether the same military that had so often in the past intervened to beat them to pulp when they dared vote for the opposition and which in the 1980s had killed 20,000 civilians in protracted massacre of its political opponents, was indeed proffering it the keys to its prison.

By the weekend, suspicion had turned to unbridled optimism. More than 100,000 Zimbabweans of all races assembled for peaceful demonstrations throughout the country to celebrate the ousting of Mugabe. Opposition groupings expressed guarded approval of the military’s actions, with the caveat that there should be a cross-party process of democratization, free elections and an end to the flouting of human rights.

Faced with what now seemed might be a popular uprising, in the style of the Arab Spring that in 2010 transformed the political landscape of North Africa and the Middle East, the AU changed tack and expressed confidence that that a solution would be found within “constitutional legality.” It quickly passed the political hot potato to the 15-nation Southern African Development Community, the regional intergovernmental cooperative body currently chaired by South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma.

On Sunday, Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party fired Mugabe as its leader and recalled him from the presidency. They also issued an ultimatum that were he not to resign by noon on Monday, impeachment procedures would be started immediately.

The strangest defender of the legality of these actions by the military turned out to be Mugabe himself. When on Sunday he appeared on state television, ostensibly to resign, he said that the “military operation” was motivated by “a deep patriotic concern for the stability of the nation” and did “not amount to a threat to our well-cherished constitutional order.”

Whatever delight those words by Mugabe would have afforded the military, in that they effectively immunized the presidential overthrow against any AU intervention, the pleasure was short-lived. Departing from the script apparently agreed to by Mugabe and the stony-faced generals seated on the podium with him, Mugabe did not resign, but instead insisted in a long and rambling address that the necessary corrective actions would be undertaken under his oversight.

It is not clear why Mugabe reneged on an agreement which supposedly included assurances that he and his family would not face any legal actions relating to his presidency, nor would he have to return any of the billions of dollars that they have accumulated during his office. Whether or not it was incipient senility, as many assume, it ironically benefited the opposition – for Zanu-PF would need opposition parliamentary support to impeach the president.

It’s now a moot point. Mugabe has resigned “voluntarily … to ensure the smooth transfer of power” and opposition co-operation – which would have come at the cost of Zanu-PF agreeing to a democratization timetable – is no longer needed. Mnangagwa, the Crocodile, who has a violent and controversial political past, will succeed him “within 48 hours,” says Zanu-PF.

The coup that was not a coup took a week. It will take longer for Zimbabweans to find out whether their jubilation at the unexpected transformation of their onetime oppressors to uniformed liberators will be vindicated or dashed. But as one said to me, “When you have been waiting so long, the replacement of Mugabe with Devil himself is an improvement. It opens the door to change. And change has its own momentum.”

But he said he was hopeful a meeting between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday would lead to a deal in time for a Dec. 14-15 EU summit. That would allow Britain to move on to talks on its future trading relations with the bloc.

Avoiding a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland is the last major hurdle before talks begin on the future trade relationship and a two-year Brexit transition.

Tusk said he had asked May to “put a final offer on the table” by Monday, but Coveney suggested agreement on the wording of written reassurances may come later.

“The hope is that those [Monday] meetings will result in a momentum that can be carried into the leaders’ summit the week after ... and can allow this Brexit negotiation process to open up to phase two of discussions,” Coveney told RTE radio.

Asked if he expected an agreed text of written British assurances on the issue Monday morning, Coveney said: “Let’s not run before we can walk here. Obviously, we would like that to be the case.”

The Irish cabinet is to meet at 0900 GMT on Monday and give Prime Minister Leo Varadkar a mandate to make a decision on the border issue.

“That may or may not be on the back of an agreed wording. That remains to be seen over the next number of hours,” Coveney said.

The vision for the state of Borno, ground zero for the war with the Islamist insurgency, is a stark admission of the reality in the northeast.

For two years, the military and government have said Boko Haram is all but defeated, and the remnants are being mopped up.

But the military is largely unable to control territory beyond the cities and towns it has wrested back from Boko Haram. That means many of the nearly 2 million displaced people across the northeast cannot return to their homes in rural areas.

Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno state, said it was not possible for people to live in small villages.

“There’s beauty in numbers, there’s security in numbers. So our target is to congregate all the people in five major urban settlements and provide them with means of livelihood, education, health care and of course security,” he told Reuters. “It’s a long term solution, certainly.”

The plan for the eastern part of the state, centered on the town of Bama, is intended as a pilot scheme to be rolled out in other parts of Borno if it is successful.

Vigilantes, currently members of a group known as the Civilian Joint Task Force, will become agricultural rangers, the governor said.

Aided by Nigerian security forces, they will aim to secure and patrol a five-km (three-mile) radius around each garrison town where people can farm.

PROTECTION

Peter Lundberg, the United Nations Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, who heads the organization’s response in the northeast, said the reconstruction of Bama town, the second biggest in the state, was “logical”.

“People are very eager to go back if the conditions are right and if the conditions are safe, if the conditions are dignified, and of course it has to be voluntary,” he told Reuters.

Sentiment amongst the displaced is mixed.

Abubakar Goni, who lived outside Bama before fleeing to the Borno state capital Maiduguri, said he wants to return home, but if the town is safer he will agree to go there.

“I will support it as long as I will have a place to farm. I am also happy to hear the government will give us protection on the farm because I learnt Boko Haram men are still around.”

Others, like Tijja Modu Alhaji, are wary of potential disputes between residents of the towns where people will be sent and the returnees.

“I don’t want to stay in Bama because I will still be a stranger there, just as I am in Maiduguri now,” he said. “I want to go home, not to somebody else’s land.”

The governor’s plan is still in its early stages. It involves bringing back thousands of people who fled the town of Bama and the surrounding area and sought refuge in camps in Maiduguri and elsewhere.

They will eventually be housed in towns such as Bama, which was largely abandoned by its inhabitants when Boko Haram took it three years ago, but has since been recaptured by the military.

Many of Bama’s buildings are still shells, windows smashed, doors ripped out and roofs gone. Telephone and electricity wires remain torn down, more than two years after the military evicted Boko Haram.

Slideshow (13 Images)

It is not clear how the returnees will be housed. There are already 15,000 people in a crowded camp for displaced local residents set up by the military after it retook the town.

The United Nations had planned to move them gradually to new shelters accommodating 30,000 people that have been erected in the town, but the military said it could not oversee two camps there at the same time, UN and military officials told Reuters.

NEW HOMES

The government has announced plans to build 3,000 homes in the Bama area. But there are concerns about how people sent to the town will manage, since many did not originally live there.

“It’s one thing to move people to Bama,” said Lundberg. “Unless the engine of the economy can restart, the risk is that people are moving back to places where they will become very dependent (on aid).”

Aid workers said the demarcation between garrison towns and a lawless countryside means people have a choice: live in virtual quarantine, or return to their homes in the countryside, where Boko Haram roam, and be treated by security forces as potential insurgency sympathizers.

“You’re imprisoned, but you’re safe,” said one senior relief worker, speaking on condition of anonymity. “If you prefer your own life you can do it on the outside.”

Boko Haram’s recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that killed at least 50 in a mosque in Adamawa state last week, are the “last kicks of a dying horse,” Nigeria’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed said last Sunday.

But military and diplomatic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said overstretched troops are unable to push Boko Haram out of non-urban areas. Much of Borno is not under the authorities’ control and attacks are rife.

On Saturday, suicide bombers killed at least 13 people in the town of Biu and injured 53 others.

“Borno is not getting better at all. It may have even gotten worse,” a diplomat said of the security situation outside urban areas. “There is no recovery and stabilization.”",Nigeria puts fortress towns at heart of new Boko Haram strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DX0FE-OZATP

Schmidt pleaded guilty in August in the U.S. District Court in Detroit to wrongdoing connected to a massive diesel emissions scandal that has cost Volkswagen as much as $30 billion. He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 6.

“I must say that I feel misused by my own company in the diesel scandal or ‘Dieselgate’,” Schmidt wrote to U.S. judge Sean Cox, according to a letter filed in federal court.

The letter was originally published by Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment, citing the ongoing proceedings.

Under a plea agreement, Schmidt faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of between $40,000 and $400,000 after admitting to conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violating clean air laws.

In March, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three felony counts under a plea agreement to resolve U.S. charges it installed secret software in vehicles to evade emissions tests.

U.S. prosecutors have charged eight current and former Volkswagen executives.

Schmidt was in charge of the company’s environmental and engineering office in Auburn Hills, Michigan, until February 2015, where he oversaw emissions issues.

In the letter to the judge, he said he had agreed to follow a script, or talking points, agreed by Volkswagen management and a high-ranking lawyer, at a meeting with Alberto Ayala, a California Air Resources Board executive.

“In hindsight, I should never have agreed to meet with Dr Ayala on that day,” he wrote.

“Or better yet, I should have gone to that meeting and ignored the instructions given to me and told Dr Ayala that there is a defeat device in the VW diesel engine vehicles and that VW had been cheating for almost a decade. I did not do that and that is why I find myself here today.”

After being informed of the existence of the emissions software in the summer of 2015, according to his guilty plea, Schmidt conspired with other executives to avoid disclosing “intentional cheating” by the automaker in a bid to seek regulatory approval for its model 2016 VW 2 liter diesels.","Volkswagen 'misused' me, accused executive tells judge",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-volkswagen-emissions/volkswagen-misused-me-accused-executive-tells-judge-idUKKBN1DX0BS

At a time when many cities have pulled out of Olympics bids given concerns about massive costs, Canadian sports minister Kent Hehr told CBC he feels the 1988 Winter Games host would benefit from doing it again.

”I know an Olympic bid, deep in my heart, would be something that would be extraordinary,“ Hehr said in the report. ”But you have to balance it in a real way.

“We’re always excited when communities like Calgary are thinking about putting their hat in the ring about bringing the Olympic Games to this nation.”

Cities around the world are no longer clamoring to host an Olympics. Many in recent years have removed themselves from consideration, either scared off by the size and cost of the Games or pressured by local opposition.

Calgary’s city council recently voted to give C$1 million to continue research into bidding to host the 2026 Games. A bid exploration committee has estimated that staging the sporting extravaganza would come with a price tag of about C$4.6 billion.

According to Hehr, there was plenty of economic uncertainty in Calgary during the late 1970s and early 1980s and many people who did not want the city to host the Olympics.

“There were lots of naysayers around that as well,” Hehr told CBC. “But the legacy that was left, the opportunities it gave kids in the community to develop, I think were well worth the angst and the time.”

According to the CBC article, while Hehr feels an Olympics in Calgary would offer a sense of pride to all of Canada, he continues to maintain a balanced and measured approach.

True, the Democrats did well, picking up state legislative seats from Georgia to New Hampshire, including a massive swing of at least 15 seats in Virginia, as well as the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey.

But politics can change quickly: Democrats lost the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia in 2009 and took heavy losses in the 2010 congressional midterms, yet Barack Obama won reelection in 2012. Yesterday’s wins may portend Democratic gains in Congress in 2018. But maybe they won’t.

The true implication of the 2017 elections is what they mean for redistricting and electoral reforms in the years to come.

Far more important to future election cycles than any help in prognosticating the public mood one or three years from now is what the results mean for the next round of redistricting that begins in 2021. Although the next redistricting process will not occur for another four years, what happened in elections throughout the country this week will have a significant impact. The governors, state legislators, mayors, and city council members elected this year will play a major role in drawing district lines – and thus setting the course for American democracy.

Under the U.S. Constitution, once a decade states must redraw their legislative lines for Congress, state legislatures, and even local governments like city councils. That task falls in most states to state legislatures and the state’s governor. The legislature will take the data it receives from the 2020 Census and draw district lines for congressional seats and the legislature itself, and the governor will decide whether to approve or veto those maps. City councils often use similar processes for their own lines.

It matters, then, who is charged with the task of drawing those maps. Politicians of both parties engage in extreme partisan gerrymandering, where they draw the lines to help their own political parties and their own electoral interests. The politicians essentially pick their constituents, instead of the other way around.

During the 2011 redistricting, Republicans controlled the majority of statehouses and governor’s mansions. They used that power to entrench their control. That is why, for example, Republicans won 60 of Wisconsin’s 99 state legislative seats in the 2012 election with only 48 percent of the vote. Similar tactics created disproportionately Republican state legislatures and congressional delegations across the country. In Pennsylvania, another swing state, Republicans gerrymandered their way into winning 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats with only half of the votes cast in 2012. In Southern states such as North Carolina and Texas, Republicans drew districts that limit Democratic seats by minimizing the representation of minorities such as Latinos and African-Americans, which courts have ruled violates the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

Although it tends not to disempower under-represented minorities, Democrats frequently engage in gerrymandering too: Democrats in Maryland passed a pro-Democratic map that plaintiffs challenged as an unlawful partisan gerrymander. The litigation is still ongoing. City Councils are also not immune from the problem, often drawing the lines for their own elections that favor the incumbents or the party in control.

What yesterday’s elections mean, then, is that Democrats can greatly influence the redistricting process, at least in Virginia. (New Jersey uses an independent redistricting commission.) Democrats can, if they want, draw maps that will favor their side through 2030. Even if the Supreme Court overturns Wisconsin’s gerrymander in a highly-watched case this term, there still will be wiggle room for partisans to skew the maps toward their favor.

Fifty-nine of the nation’s 100 largest cities also held elections in 2017, mostly for mayor and city council. These smaller governmental entities will also engage in redistricting in 2021. Given that many of these positions have four-year terms, those elected this week will still be in office when the actual redistricting process begins.

And it is not just redistricting at stake. State legislatures have the power to enact numerous rules that affect the voting process, such as voter ID requirements or early voting periods. In 2016, Virginia’s Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe restored the voting rights of thousands of felons. This year’s Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, probably would not have done the same had he been in office. Gillespie also supports a strict voter ID requirement, which tends to reduce turnout among groups of voters who skew Democratic such as non-whites and young people. That kind of shaping of the electorate could have a significant impact on who wins Virginia – a key swing state − in the 2020 presidential election.

In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie vetoed a bill to implement automatic voter registration, in which the government would place eligible voters on the registration rolls, allowing them to opt-out instead of requiring them to opt-in. Automatic voter registration, which began in Oregon and is now sweeping the country, increases turnout. Democrat Phil Murphy’s win in New Jersey means that automatic voter registration will now likely become law – again impacting future elections. Automatic voter registration also might come to Washington state because a Democratic candidate is leading in the vote count from Tuesday in a race that will determine majority control of the state senate.

Of course, deciding who may vote should not be a partisan issue. Independent commissions or other nonpartisan approaches should determine redistricting. It should be easy and convenient for every eligible voter to participate. But that is not the current reality of American politics.

The best way to think about the 2017 elections is to consider them not for what they mean for Donald Trump but how they will determine the rules of elections for a decade or more.

The cast and director provided few details about the film's plot. John Boyega, who plays former Stormtrooper Finn, said the movie finds Leia, now a general, leading the Resistance against the evil First Order during a tense time in the raging battle to protect the galaxy far, far away. ""There is a lot of pressure on the Resistance, and General Leia is on the front lines having to make big decisions,"" Boyega said. ""It's a performance that requires a heartfelt approach, and she definitely had that."" Oscar Isaac, who plays Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, said the time in Leia's life mirrored Fisher's in some ways. Leia understands ""she's not going to be around forever, and there is a passing of the torch that needs to happen,"" Isaac said. ""She wants to give over as much of her wisdom as she can before this moment happens."" Fisher, however, would not wants fans to get too sentimental, Hamill said. ""I do know her well enough to say that she would want us to be laughing and even mocking her,"" Hamill said.

May has said she would create an economy which works for all Britons, but the commission’s chairman Alan Milburn, a former minister in Tony Blair’s Labour government, said she was failing to deliver on her promises.

“I have reached the conclusion sadly that the current government bears little, if any, hope of progress being made toward the fairer Britain the prime minister has talked about,” Milburn told the BBC on Sunday.

“The government for understandable reasons is focused on Brexit and seems to lack the bandwith to be able to translate the rhetoric of healing social division and promoting social justice into reality.”

May talked about tackling the “burning injustices” in society on her first day as prime minister last year.

She talked about tackling racism, gender inequality, the underperformance of government schools and the difficulties young people face buying a home.

A government spokesman said it was making good progress on social mobility.

“We accept there is more to do and that is why we are focusing our efforts in disadvantaged areas where we can make the biggest difference,” the spokesman said.

May, who presides over a warring cabinet and has faced an open rebellion by some of her own lawmakers, is being buffeted by crises.

Two ministers have quit May’s cabinet in the last month, placing a strain on the government ahead of the Dec. 14-15 summit on Britain’s exit from the European Union, when Britain wants EU leaders to give a green light to talks about future trade relations.

An opinion poll published for the Mail On Sunday newspaper put Labour on 45 percent with the ruling Conservatives on 37 percent, the biggest lead for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn’s party in a survey by pollster Survation since late 2013.

“An 8 point lead would put the Labour party into overall majority territory if such vote share totals were reflected at the ballot box,” Survation said.

In “Capitalism without Capital”, economics professor Jonathan Haskel and policy advisor Stian Westlake deliver an important and thought-provoking account of why this matters. They show how current policies are inadequate to tackle emerging social and economic challenges. But the book falls short of addressing the pressing issue of how to rein in dominant tech companies like Facebook and Google.

Companies have always invested in hard-to-grasp items like research and development, design and human talent. Computers and the internet have brought spending on software and systems. The big shift is how important these factors have become for modern economies. Since the start of the 21st century, intangible investments have overtaken tangible ones in developed countries including the United States and United Kingdom.

To illustrate this phenomenon consider Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation. Traditional assets such as plant and equipment account for just 9 percent of the assets on its balance sheet and a mere 4 percent of its $880 billion market value. Rivals Alphabet and Microsoft also have very little in the way of physical assets. What makes these companies valuable are factors not captured by conventional accounting, like Apple’s premium brand and supply-chain prowess.

Haskel and Westlake draw on numerous examples and economic research to bolster their arguments on how the rise of intangibles has impacted businesses, societies, labour and financial markets. Their thesis is that intangible assets have fundamentally different characteristics from physical ones. The authors call these the “four S‘s”: they are scalable, have sunk costs, their benefits spill over, and they have synergies with other intangibles.

This framework leads to a thought-provoking analysis of two complex issues faced by many developed countries: the fall in investment and productivity growth in major economies – often summarised as the “secular stagnation” hypothesis – and rising wealth inequality. The growing importance of intangible assets, the authors argue, helps explain persistent low productivity and even the rise of populist political movements.

First, innovative ideas can be used and re-used in multiple places at the same time. This scalability has allowed a relatively small number of dominant firms to emerge. Companies like Facebook can build up massive user bases, making it prohibitively expensive for anyone else to compete in what become winner-takes-all markets. The remaining laggards have even less incentive to invest as the profit gap widens.

The authors rightly acknowledge that intangible investments also encourage rent-seeking practices such as patent trolling and tax avoidance. These “do no good for the economy ... but instead are about slicing the existing economic pie to the exclusive benefit of the intangible investor.” This is a particularly timely issue, given the growing backlash against big pharmaceutical groups as well as companies like Uber, which stands accused of circumventing existing regulations. The immense influence and dominance of Facebook and Google have also come under fierce scrutiny.

Second, the synergies and benefit spillovers from intangible investments mean densely-populated cities are more likely to attract top talent and companies. That in turn pushes up the value of urban real estate, which makes up a significant share of new wealth for the very rich. More speculatively, the authors suggest the people who benefit from the intangible economy tend to be more open to new ideas. Though it’s overly simplistic to attribute widening social and economic divisions to this development, the book offers a nuanced and fresh way to understand economic winners and losers.

What can governments do? The book offers some sensible if at times clichéd policy prescriptions. Governments should improve and clarify protection for intellectual property rights, adopt effective urban planning policies, and provide tax breaks and other incentives to encourage financial markets to invest in and lend more to businesses.

Haskel and Westlake’s suggestions for tackling inequality are more disappointing. To be fair, the authors admit they do not have the solution. Yet they half-heartedly suggest that policymakers should “encourage trust and strong institutions, encourage opportunity, mitigate divisive social conflict, and prevent powerful firms from indulging in rent seeking.” The question of whether governments can or should do more to curb the power of dominant tech companies is left unanswered.

There is no simple answer to how governments should respond to the challenges raised in this book. What’s clear, though, is that the current approach is not fit for an increasingly intangible world.",Breakingviews - Review: Firm ideas for a world of soft assets,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-global-economics-breakingviews/breakingviews-review-firm-ideas-for-a-world-of-soft-assets-idUKKBN1DV5CH

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

If the briefs filed by the petitioner and its most influential allies are any indication, the strategy will likely be to portray this case as a unique one that would warrant a very narrow constitutional exception. But don’t be fooled. If the state of Colorado’s application of its laws is found to be unconstitutional, it would unleash a widespread assault on civil rights protections.

In 2012, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, to arrange for a cake to be made for their wedding reception. They were told by Jack Phillips, the store’s owner, that he could not fulfill their order because his religious beliefs prevented him from preparing goods for same-sex wedding ceremonies (although he was otherwise willing to serve LBGT customers). Mullins and Craig sued Masterpiece under Colorado civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by “public accommodations” (businesses or other institutions that are regularly open to the public). Mullins and Craig won: the Colorado Civil Rights Division agreed that Masterpiece had illegally discriminated against them, and its decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals. Masterpiece appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.

It would be natural to assume that this case will be argued on the basis of freedom of religion protections in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has recently given companies broad freedom to ignore laws in deference to the owner’s religious faith. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court held that employers could reject requirements that taxpayer-subsidized employer-provided health insurance cover contraception if doing so would violate the religious beliefs. But while Masterpiece has raised religious freedom objections, the case is unlikely to turn on these grounds. Since the 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court has held that the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment is not violated when a religion-neutral law incidentally burdens an individual’s religious beliefs, as long as that law did not intentionally target religious minorities. Colorado’s application of civil rights law clearly did not violate the free exercise clause based on this precedent, so an argument solely on free religion grounds would be a certain loser.

The Hobby Lobby ruling was based not on the First Amendment but on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a statute passed in response to Employment Division. Since the 1997 Supreme Court ruling in City of Boerne v. Flores, however, RFRA does not apply to state governments. It would therefore be nearly impossible for Masterpiece to prevail on a religious freedom claim.

Backed up by a brief from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, Masterpiece will almost certainly focus on another part of the First Amendment: the free speech clause. The shop is arguing that, given the artistry involved in creating a custom wedding cake, compelling it to create a cake for a ceremony it morally disapproves of would violate its rights to freedom of speech and expression.

Creating religious exceptions to generally applicable laws would make civil rights statutes very difficult to enforce, since discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation can all be defended on religious grounds. If applied logically, a religious exemption would quickly mean that civil rights laws exist only at the pleasure of the employer.

Recognizing this liability in a free expression argument, Masterpiece will likely claim that a free expression exemption applies only in the very narrow context of a mom-and-pop bakery being asked to make something for a particular ceremony. Most employees of most companies, they will argue, are not engaged in activity that is similarly expressive.

But as the libertarian legal scholars Dale Carpenter and Eugene Volokh argue in their persuasive amicus brief on behalf of Colorado, if Masterpiece’s free speech claim were accepted by the Court, it would “apply to a vast range of conduct.” Many of the activities employees and their supervisors engage in on the job have elements as potentially “expressive” as baking a cake, and this is true of both tiny storefronts and Fortune 500 corporations. “[Restaurant chain] Subway calls its sandwich-makers ‘sandwich artists,’” Carpenter and Volokh observe, “[b]ut a restaurant may not refuse to cook or prepare a table for certain customers on the ground that it would be a free speech compulsion.” Similarly, a florist who didn’t want to participate in a same-sex wedding could declare themselves “floral artists,” hotel receptionists could declare themselves “phone answering artists,” and so on.

It is unclear about where the line would end up being drawn should the Court accept Masterpiece’s free speech argument. But even if it ended up being fairly narrow, it would still require extensive litigation to find out. And it’s likely that in practice the exceptions would not be narrow at all. The wise approach for the Supreme Court would be to follow the lead of the Colorado court and uphold the sound judgement of the state’s civil rights commission: that while Jack Phillips is entitled to his beliefs, when he opens a business to the public he is required to follow state laws and treat his customers equally.

Delhi’s government last month ordered schools temporarily shut after pollution readings in some places peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government’s air quality index that measures poisonous particles.

India’s bowling coach Bharat Arun, however, played down the issue.

“Ravi was pretty simple. He said ‘please get on with the game, you don’t need to stop’,” Arun said.

“When the play was unnecessarily being stopped, we just wanted to get on with the game because our focus is to win the test match.”

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUSKBN1D31U1

The trial has caused already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington to deteriorate further as Zarrab detailed in court a scheme to evade the U.S. sanctions, saying that Erdogan personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when prime minister.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

Since he was sworn in January, Democrat Josh Shapiro has built up his own consumer finance unit in preparation for when Republican Trump’s officials take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

The unit is staffed with more than a dozen people and led by a former senior CFPB attorney. Shapiro and this team have already filed cases against Navient (NAVI.O), a student loan servicer, which is accused of deceiving borrowers in order to drive up profits, and are leading a 48-state investigation into hacking at Equifax (EFX.N), a consumer credit bureau.

”We’re demonstrating a capacity to handle these big, complex

consumer financial protection cases,” Shapiro told Reuters, adding that attorneys general from both parties have asked about how they can “mimic our efforts”.

Navient has said it operates within federal laws and rules on student loans, and has contested similar charges brought by the CFPB in court. An Equifax spokesperson said the company cannot comment on pending litigation, “but we remain focused on helping our customers, as well as their employees and consumers, to navigate this situation.”

Shapiro expects his case load will grow, particularly now that Trump has installed his budget director and fierce CFPB critic, Mick Mulvaney, as temporary chief of the agency.

The press office at the Office of Management and Budget, which is currently handling public relations for CFPB, said it was too early to comment on Democratic attorneys’ plans.

“However, of course we will carry out what we are statutorily obliged to enforce,” spokesman John Czwartacki said.

Created in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis to crack down on predatory financial practices, the CFBP has long been criticized by Republicans, including Trump, who say it is far too powerful and burdens lenders with red tape.

POWERFUL WEAPON

Shapiro is part of a group of Democratic attorneys general from powerful and large states such as California and New York who disagree with Trump’s call for financial deregulation.

Since Trump’s inauguration in January, those top law enforcement officials have sued the administration at least 25 times over its crackdown on immigration and dismantling of regulations across a range of areas from energy to education.

When it comes to financial consumer protection state attorneys general wield an additional potentially powerful weapon.

A little-known provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which created the CFPB, gives them the authority to enforce the agency’s rules and its broad ban on “unfair, deceptive and abusive” practices beyond state lines.

States have rarely used those provisions while Richard Cordray, appointed by President Barack Obama and known for aggressively pursuing financial firms, was in charge of the watchdog.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters at the White House in Washington, U.S. November 28, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

But with his departure last week, Mulvaney freezing new rulemakings and hiring and a permanent successor expected to loosen the watchdog’s regulation and enforcement, top attorneys in states such as Pennsylvania and California say they are preparing to get more active.

“If we have to do this with just states that makes it more difficult but that doesn’t make it impossible,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat.

One difficulty for states wanting to pursue federal enforcement cases and go after financial firms across state lines, is that, by law, they must notify the CFPB, said Ori Lev, consumer financial services partner at law firm Mayer Brown.

If they proceed without the CFPB’ blessing or if the agency changes its mind about a case, then the agency could challenge them in federal court, and they would most likely have to defer to the CFPB, said C. Boyden Gray, a founding partner of Boyden Gray & Associates, who works with the conservative Federalist Society on tracking regulation.

Still, attorneys general have jurisdiction to sue institutions operating in their states under state consumer protection laws and they could join forces to pursue cases nationally. Attorneys general contacted by Reuters and the Democratic Attorneys General Association, representing 22 officials, or nearly half the top state attorneys in the country, said they were prepared to take on more cases.

Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said his office’s consumer finance division now had 27 attorneys, compared with 11 four years ago.

”Consequently, we are well positioned to use all the tools available to us to protect Washingtonians if a new leader of the CFPB does not share director Cordray’s vigor for protecting consumers,” the Democrat said.

Before the consumer watchdog was created, states often took the lead in cases involving consumer lenders.

As Ohio’s attorney general, Cordray, for example, led the investigation of financial firms which precipitated the financial crisis, winning more than $2 billion in settlements for the state and its pension funds.

Consumer advocacy groups have generally applauded the work of both the CFPB and the states on consumer protections, but some Republican attorneys general have sided with Trump on the need to rein in the federal watchdog.

In a Nov. 27 letter to Trump, Republican attorneys from West Virginia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma said Mulvaney would help curb “the CFPB’s practice of overreaching regulation that harms the interests of consumers and small financial institutions.”

Anticipating more state activity, Maria Earley, partner at the law firm Reed Smith, has been advising clients facing CFPB charges against stalling in hopes the watchdog will become more lenient under Trump.

“You may want to litigate to run out the clock, but you’re going to have six, seven, eight states who will start looking into you,” Earley said, adding she has settled three CFPB cases for clients since Trump took office. Reuters could not independently verify this number.

Michelle Rogers, a partner with Buckley Sandler, said Wall Street may end up with increased regulatory complexity rather than relief as the state attorneys step in.

“They are more nimble than a big federal agency. They have their own staff, and their own agenda, and they can send out a subpoena on a whim on a broader set of issues,” she said.

The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging America’s friends back into confusion over President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.

The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washington’s leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria.

“Just as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,” said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials.

“It leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump.”

U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue.

European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union.

In addition, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities.

“The chaos in the administration doesn’t help in the current geopolitical climate,” said a senior French diplomat.

Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy.

“The United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad,” he told a think tank.

He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday.

The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.

“If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy – those expectations have been disappointed,” said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats in parliament.

“On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.”

Despite Tillerson’s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.

The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence.

Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis.

Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump’s foreign policy, diplomats said.

“LARGER DOSE OF TRUMP”

There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump.

“We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,” if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.

One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, “so it never left Tillerson much room.”

In addition, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace.

But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later.

Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say.

The assumption of weakness is such that speculation on who could follow May as prime minister is a daily game.","Great Britain – ever ready to boast stable politics and a faultless, often-called “Rolls Royce” civil service – is in a mess. Between scandals over sex, secret meetings, political donors and the royal family, the government is melting down.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and her deputy, Damian Green, in the House of Commons, Nov. 1, 2017. Green is fighting allegations of harassment and having “extreme pornography"" on his parliamentary computer. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS

The country’s own newspapers say so. On Thursday, The Times carried the front page headline “Brussels braced for fall of Theresa May’s government” – this before it has served half a year.

Where British journalism fails to convey the dimensions of the mess, foreign journalists oblige. Steven Erlanger of the New York Times told his Sunday readers in early November that the country is “heading to nowhere, while on deck, fire has broken out and the captain — poor Theresa May — is lashed to the mast, without the authority to decide whether to turn to port or to starboard.” The Irish writer Fintan O’Toole writes in the New York Review of Books that “Brexit is fueled by fantasies of “Empire 2.0,” a reconstructed global trading empire in which the old colonies will be reconnected to the mother country.”

The first of these, if finely phrased, is overblown; the second is absurd. No-one but a real fantasist believes the empire can be reconstituted, or wishes it to be. But schadenfreude is too attractive an emotion to pass up, an occasion to pay the U.K. back for its haughtiness to other countries it deems less well governed than itself.

The real question here is whether the May government can survive. And what happens if it can’t?

The current mess is the result of the workings of democracy, which decreed opening the gates to the barbarians. Barbarians are the forces which mainstream politicians try to keep outside the walls; now, they have forced an entry. In the United States, the invasion is led by Donald Trump: his barbarians are those who take seriously his calls to “drain the swamp” (of Washington) and “put America first” (by de-linking it from much of what is understood by globalization).

Britain’s barbarians have breached the walls of both major parties. Labour is now led by a group of far leftists, gathered round the figure of Jeremy Corbyn, a man who believes in the socialization of much of the economy, has supported and praised the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah and favors a call for the former Labour leader, Tony Blair, to be tried for war crimes. Corbyn and his fellow radical members of parliament were barely tolerated by the rest of their parliamentary colleagues, yet when he ran for Labour’s leadership in 2015, a sudden swell of support from mainly young party members propelled him, astonished, to the leadership. The barbarians had flooded in; the party’s unexpectedly good showing in the general election this summer confirmed they were inside the walls to stay.

The Conservative barbarians are those who hate Britain’s membership of the European Union. The parliamentary barbarian group – a minority – plagued the leadership: John Major, prime minister from 1991-1997, called them, unaware of an open microphone, “bastards”. Their strength forced David Cameron, prime minister from 2010-2016, into the fateful decision to put the issue of EU membership to a referendum. He lost, and so the victorious barbarians inherited the party.

It was not, however, one of their number who became prime minister. That was “poor Theresa May”, an unenthusiastic European Union remainer, who won the party leadership over two Brexiteer challengers, but who fully accepted that the people had spoken and Britain’s exit from the EU would be pursued.

In that pursuit, a sea of troubles has washed about her, and about the country. Many in her cabinet are not Brexiteers; they believe that exit is folly, and seek to extend the period of leaving the Union in order to give British business and finance more time to prepare for the new conditions. The three cabinet members most concerned with Brexit include Boris Johnson, the unpredictable Foreign Secretary, who differed sharply with the cautious chancellor, Philip Hammond, a Remainer, on the timetable for leaving. David Davis, the main negotiator with the EU on the terms of Brexit, was called stupid, lazy and “vain as Narcissus” by the former campaign director of the Vote Leave campaign, a supposed ally. The upper reaches of the governing party are murderous.

Negotiations are, in any case, going badly. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted on a rigid timetable which doesn’t suit the UK, while issues like the amount the U.K. must pay before leaving remains a block on progress.

The sea has been made much rougher by a growing sexual harassment scandal that led to the resignation of defense minister Michael Fallon. Damian Green, effectively the deputy prime minister, is fighting allegations of harassment and “extreme pornography” said to have been found on his parliamentary computer.

The scandals multiply, usually displayed at the top of TV bulletins and on front pages. A careless remark by Foreign Secretary Johnson may have prolonged the prison sentence of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British citizen jailed in Iran on spying charges by wrongly claiming she had been training journalists there. Lord Ashcroft, a major Conservative donor, was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” leak to have sheltered a large part of his wealth offshore.

He was not alone: both the Queen and her son, Prince Charles, were revealed by the leak as having benefitted from tax-free shelters.

In the same week, International Development Secretary Priti Patel was forced to resign when she was found to have concealed a series of meetings with Israeli ministers without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or the prime minister. Patel’s replacement – Penny Mordaunt – had to be, like her, a keen Brexiteer; May does not have the freedom to choose on the basis of competence, only on the basis of alignment.

The prime minister is clearly weak, and has been since nearly losing the election to Labour. The enormity of the task – of unpicking hundreds of regulations, laws and agreements while forging new trading links, staunching a retreat of the finance sector from the City of London, attracting new and keeping established investment and combating the Scots nationalists who continue to threaten another referendum on independence – calls for strength and confidence.

Neither is much in evidence. The assumption of weakness is such that speculation on who could follow May as prime minister is a daily game. Most bets are on Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary and former journalist – clever, agile and a keen Brexiteer, but inheriting the same gnawing problems with which May has been forced to grapple. Were the Conservatives to lose their thin majority in the Commons on a confidence vote, a new election would be ordered – with the far-left-led Labour Party, on present poll figures, favorite. The country would then be even more deeply divided than before.

This is barbarian rule, otherwise known as democracy. Tens of millions in the democratic world experience insecurity, stagnant incomes or fear of mass immigration – sometimes all of these. They have chosen to vote for barbarians because the civilized people were not, they thought, caring, or at least not responding. Deeply uncomfortable, even dangerous, as the effects are, the rules by which states which offer political choice live must respect these votes. And hope for civilization to win, even among the barbarians.",Commentary: Britain’s mess extends beyond Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-brexit-commentary/commentary-britains-mess-extends-beyond-brexit-idUSKBN1DA2ON

Morocco recalled its ambassador from South Africa in 2004 after former South African president Thabo Mbeki recognized a breakaway region in the Western Sahara which Morocco claims as part of its territory.

“Morocco is an African nation and we need to have relations with them,” Zuma told City Press in the interview. “We never had problems with them anyway; they were the first to withdraw diplomatic relations.”

Zuma met Morocco’s King Mohammed last week on the sidelines of an African Union-European Union summit.

“They felt that even if we differ on the Western Sahara issues, the two countries should have a relationship,” Zuma said about Moroccan officials’ position at the meeting.

South Africa’s official government position - as re-affirmed by Zuma in one of his state of the nation addresses - is to support “self determination and decolonization for the Western Sahara”.

The decision to re-establish ties with Morocco is likely to go down badly with some members of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC), of which Zuma is leader.

The ANC - as one of Africa’s oldest liberation movements - has long backed those seeking independence in the Western Sahara and has accused Morocco of occupying the region.

The ruling party said in a statement it had “unequivocal support for Western Sahara” but that this did not mean it harbored enmity toward Morocco.

“There is also no ANC policy that says South Africa should isolate Morocco,” the statement said.

A spokesman for South Africa’s foreign ministry could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Neil Chapman, the head of its global chemicals operations, was named to the company’s management committee, a board-elected panel that typically serves as a stepping stone for future chief executives, Exxon said on Friday.

Chapman, 55, joins CEO Woods and four other senior vice presidents on the committee, which oversees the company’s global operations. The president of ExxonMobil Chemical Co also was promoted to corporate senior vice president.

The merger of the world’s largest publicly-traded oil producer’s refining and marketing operations will take place in the first quarter, the company said.

Bryan Milton, 53, president of Exxon’s fuels, lubricants & specialties marketing business, was named president of the new ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co effective Jan. 1.

Dennis Wascom, president of Exxon’s refining and supply subsidiary, will become vice president of operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri.

Woods took over the top job in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.

The merging of refining, lubricants and marketing is the first major move by Woods since replacing Tillerson and is in the company’s downstream operations, which he used to lead before taking over as CEO.

The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and lubricant businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operation, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices.

The company’s downstream sector has grown in prominence since Woods took over leadership of Exxon.

The changes come as Exxon expands its refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Scott Lemieux: How Trump is making it easier to exploit consumers

In Italy, the only large European state with a center-left government, the Partito Democratico, suffered a bad defeat in the Sicilian regional elections earlier this month. The right-wing coalition, led by the never-say-dead Silvio Berlusconi, won convincingly. National elections are expected in the spring of next year.

In former communist states, the center-leftists frequently shift leaders and make alliances with centrists or even far rightists. The Estonian Social Democrats are junior partners in the ruling center-right coalition. The Romanian Social Democrats fired their own prime minister, Sorin Grindeanu, earlier this year after he tried to decriminalize some forms of corruption, and several other cabinet ministers resigned last month – though the party remains in power. In Slovakia, the social democrats lead a shifting and crisis-prone coalition after losing their parliamentary majority in 2016 elections.

Elsewhere, the leftist parties – the Austrian, Croatian, Cypriot, Czech, Danish, Finnish, German, Latvian and Lithuanian social democrats, the British, Dutch, Irish and Norwegian labor parties, the Bulgarian, French and Hungarian socialists, the Spanish Socialist Workers Party – find winning ever harder. In the cases of the French socialists, Greek PASOK and Dutch Labour Party, single-figure rankings in the polls make even survival a stretch.

Meanwhile, far-right parties are seeing an upsurge in support. The German federal elections drew most comment for the sudden success of the far-right Alternativ fur Deutschland (AfD) and the surprising weakness of the governing CDU/CSU centre right coalition. But the much greater fragility of Germany’s social democrats, with an historic low of just over 20 percent of the vote, is at least as momentous. This, apparently the most stable, most powerful, best socially-integrated center-left party in the world, hemorrhaged voters to the populist Linke (Left) Party and even more to the AfD.

Since the war, social democratic parties offered capitalism a deal. The state would be largely responsible for public welfare and education, and organized labor would – in varying degrees – be granted strong bargaining rights, even co-determination in enterprises. The internal, mostly unstated, agreement within the social democratic movements was that the unions would deliver the bulk of their members’ votes to the party. Capitalism would be regulated, but could be successful – as it usually was.

As the post war decades rolled on, the social democratic end of the deal softened, if at different times in different ways. Social democracy, once ambiguous about capitalism, came to work with and depend on it. In Britain, France, Germany and Italy, parties which had once embraced socialism (in Italy’s case, communism) clawed away from commitment to nationalization, ever-higher public expenditure and any form of class struggle. Both the United States under the Democrat president Bill Clinton and Germany under the SPD’s Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in the 1990s and after, adopted elements of British New Labour’s “Third Way,” essentially a new form of adaptation to capital in its more globalized form, but with relatively high public spending and liberal social policies as part of the bargain.

As globalization accelerated, social democrats came to believe that they must rival governments of the right in attracting investment and encouraging entrepreneurship. But the decline of national protections helped eviscerate much of organized labor (except in the public services) and rendered the institutions of the welfare state more fragile because more open to domestic and international competition.

Social democracy’s success in representing the organized working class and attracting a substantial slice of middle class votes depended on the influence it could bring to bear on national corporations, and national governments. Union power was reduced when faced with global corporations; the left lost one of its most powerful cards. Social democrats and liberals also lose out in their response to escalating fear of terrorism, especially in France, and the gathering rejection of immigrants in all European states.

The center-left – especially the UK’s New Labour in the mid 2000s and the Swedish social democrats in 2015-16 – had tended to be more liberal in allowing mass immigration to their countries. All now are rowing back to harsher positions, but the damage with electorates is done, at least for some time. The political philosopher Ivan Krastev writes that “the refugee crisis has dramatically changed the nature of democratic politics on the national level (prompting)… a voters’ rebellion against the meritocratic elites.” Working and lower middle class are strongly represented among these “rebellious” voters.

As global capitalism comes to be blamed increasingly for austerity, inequality, stagnant incomes and unemployment, and parties of the right fear something like a revolution, parts of electorates, especially the young, turn away from parties which are seen as little different from the center right, powerless in the face of global pressures and less militant and aggressive in pursuing alternatives. They turn to the Jeremy Corbyn-led UK Labour Party and Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France Insoumise. At the same time, those who focus on migrants and terrorism often find a new home in far right groups such as the Swedish Democrats, the AfD and France’s National Front, a powerful if internally divided force that won a record 34 percent of the vote in the final runoff of the French presidential election earlier this year.

That full-blooded socialism has failed wherever it has been tried and that the parties of the far right lean far towards authoritarian rule and a deliberate cultivation of fear and hatred has not yet severely dented the attraction of the parties of the two extremes. Thus the weakening of social democracy continues. It has lost its foundations and has not yet found its relevance to 21st century politics.",Commentary: Why social democrats have become irrelevant,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-politics-commentary/commentary-why-social-democrats-have-become-irrelevant-idUSKBN1DH27O

A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year - much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes.

U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas, along with wind and solar power. And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U.S. coal.

”We’re not planning to build any additional coal facilities,“ said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power, one of the largest U.S. utilities. “The future for coal is dictated by economics … and you can’t make those kinds of investments based on one administration’s politics.”

Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP’s capacity for power generation, a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030.

(For a graphic on coal production, demand and employment, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zKY1tQ)

The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends. As some energy experts have said all along, the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office.

A White House official did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents major U.S. coal companies.

“The government is no longer against us,“ he said. ”We now only have market forces to contend with.”

Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election.

The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; ended an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands; ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams; and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Now Trump’s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90-day supply of coal on site. The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants, a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable.

While the full impact of Trump’s coal policy could take years to understand, the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand, energy analysts and utility officials said.

“BACK 100 PERCENT”

Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation.

The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978. Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003.

“We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent,” Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016.

So far, progress has been limited.

U.S. coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year, to 790 million tons, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 2018 output is expected to decline.

The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51,900 in October, up about 2,200 since November 2016 - but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak, according to the Labor Department.

On November 1, Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet, saying, “It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!”

But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U.S. coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia, according to James Stevenson, a coal analyst at IHS Markit.

During the first six months of 2017, Asian countries took in 7.5 million short tons of U.S. coal, up 97 percent over the same period in 2016, according to the EIA.

That demand will soon fade, Stevenson said.

“We are not going to get a repeat of 2017,” he said of the spike in exports.

“OBSOLETE”

Forecasts from utilities and the U.S. government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound.

Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13,600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018. That follows a loss of nearly 8,000 MW this year and 13,000 MW in 2016, according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data.

By 2025, coal-fired power plant capacity will dip to 226,380 MW, down about 30 percent from 2011, according to EIA.

Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close, bringing the number of plants that shut, or plan to, to 265 since 2010 - a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain, according to the Sierra Club, which has campaigned against coal.

Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power - and not by environmental regulations.

Duke Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, has shut down more than 5,400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2,000 MW by 2024.

Over the next decade, Duke plans to invest $11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power - and nothing in new coal-fired generation, said spokesman Rick Rhodes.

A Nov. 2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - which has two of the largest coal producers in its district, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc - said coal-fired power plants “may eventually become obsolete.”

Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook.

Peabody expects a “modest number” of coal power plant retirements in the coming years, with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output, spokesman Vic Svec said. Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast.

Robert Murray, the chief executive of privately-held Murray Energy Corp - one of America’s biggest underground miners - said Trump could do more for the industry. The administration, Murray said, should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health.

But Trump’s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives, which have bi-partisan backing. And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so-called “endangerment finding” on emissions that is the basis of many fossil-fuel regulations, given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it.

Murray Energy, meanwhile, announced on Oct. 31 it will buy a 30.5 percent stake in a coal-mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources, LLC.

The deal might help the companies cut costs, but it’s unlikely to help workers: Murray said about 200 of 1,000 jobs in Utah could be lost.","A year after Trump's election, coal's future remains bleak",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-coal-revival/a-year-after-trumps-election-coals-future-remains-bleak-idUSKBN1DD0IA

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said. But they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when.

Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump aides.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump said on Twitter while he was in New York for a fundraising trip. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Flynn, who on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who was Trump’s national security adviser only for 24 days. He was forced to resign after he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak.

“What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for the New York trip. “There’s been absolutely no collusion, so we’re very happy.”

Establishing when Trump was told Flynn lied to the FBI agents could be key to determining if the president acted improperly.

According to a person familiar with the matter, during a conversation between White House counsel Don McGahn and then-acting attorney general Sally Yates in January, Yates told McGahn that Flynn had told FBI agents the same thing he had told Pence.

This was the same conversation reported earlier this year in which Yates told McGahn that Flynn had misled the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and that he might be compromised, the person said.

However, Yates did not give McGahn the impression that the FBI was actively pursuing Flynn for lying, the source said. McGahn did not believe the FBI was investigating Flynn for lying because the bureau had not revoked his security clearance, the person said.

McGahn shared the information from Yates with the president, the person said.

A lawyer for McGahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yates did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Legal experts said if Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI and then pressured then-FBI director James Comey not to investigate him, that would be problematic.

If that were the case Trump’s tweet “absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge,” said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Notre Dame University. “It is evidence of the crucial question of whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent.”

In May, the president fired Comey, who later accused Trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the Russia allegations. Comey also said he believed Trump had asked him to drop the FBI’s probe into Flynn.

Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, said the tweet is open to interpretation and that Trump’s lawyer would downplay its significance.

White House attorney Ty Cobb referred questions about the president’s tweet to Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd, who described it as a “paraphrase” of a statement Cobb had made on Friday reacting to Flynn’s guilty plea.

According to a person familiar with the matter, Dowd composed the tweet.

The tweet is “bizarre and helpful to Mueller and hurtful to the president,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago now at the law firm Thompson Coburn. “It’s one more piece of evidence that helps show the president’s intent when he fired Comey.”

As part of his plea on Friday, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The retired U.S. Army lieutenant general admitted in a Washington court that he lied to FBI investigators about his discussions last December with Kislyak.

In what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, the pair discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia, and Flynn asked Kislyak to help delay a United Nations vote seen as damaging to Israel, according to prosecutors.

Flynn was also told by a “very senior member” of Trump’s transition team to contact Russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the U.N. vote, the prosecutors said.

Sources told Reuters the “very senior” transition official was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Separately, speaking at a defense conference in California on Saturday, Trump’s current national security advisor H.R. McMaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of Flynn, his immediate predecessor, was hurting U.S. national security.

“There’s tremendous confidence, I think there’s more confidence in the United States frankly. I think there’s a sense that we’re re-engaging in areas where we had largely disengaged,” he said.","Trump notes Flynn lied to FBI, says his actions during transition were lawful",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-flynn-plea/trump-notes-flynn-lied-to-fbi-says-his-actions-during-transition-were-lawful-idUKKBN1DW0HO?il=0

“Salil brings in a skill mix which is widely known in the business advisory side and in the boardrooms of many of Infosys’s clients, current and prospective,” said Malay Shah, a senior director at Alvarez & Marsal.

“He will likely be a great market face for Infosys, driving growth and deal wins. The existing setup at Infosys, with Nandan as chairman and Salil as CEO, is capable of addressing key operational and technology challenges.”

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

This week’s North Korean test of a missile that might be able to reach the entire U.S. mainland with a nuclear warhead — and Trump’s initial response that “we will take care of it” — can hardly be expected to diminish the anxiety.

The simmering concern had already reached a medium boil last week when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony on the president’s authority to order a nuclear attack. The Senate hearing came at the behest of committee chairman Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who, since announcing he would not run for reelection next year, has publicly fretted that Trump’s intemperate tweets and other public pronouncements risk putting the United States “on the path to World War III.” A Democratic member of the committee, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, echoed those concerns during the hearing, saying, “the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests.”

But as the Senate hearing and subsequent commentary made clear, concern about Trump’s authority to launch an unwarranted first-strike nuclear attack is one thing; circumscribing that authority is quite another. The president holds the constitutional position of commander in chief and is obligated to protect the United States from foreign threats. The Constitution does grant to Congress the power to declare war, but it is unclear whether a law that significantly constrained the president’s nuclear command authority — particularly when the United States or it allies are under attack or in imminent danger of attack — would be constitutional. Also, as former National Security Council staffer and Duke political science professor Peter Feaver noted in his Senate testimony, legislation that attempts to alter the nuclear chain of command could have unintended and dangerous consequences, perhaps leading adversaries and allies to question the United States’ ability to respond quickly during a crisis.

Daniel DePetris: Why the U.S. shouldn't send arms to Ukraine

There are ways out of this constitutional and legislative dilemma, at least as regards a first nuclear strike by U.S. forces. The difficulty is that they require the participation of Trump himself.

In recent months, a bill proposed by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Ted Lieu of California — the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017 — has gained support from experts and activists concerned by Trump’s control of U.S. nuclear weapon use. The bill would prohibit the president from conducting “a first-use nuclear strike unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a congressional declaration of war expressly authorizing such strike.” But the Lieu-Markey bill — in my opinion an admirable effort to create a check against wanton nuclear war-making — is sponsored by two liberal Democrats and has approximately zero chance of passing the current Republican-controlled Congress.

If effective congressional action is unlikely in the short term, what might work to reassure government officials of both parties and the citizens they represent? The answer is that the president could take executive action that circumscribes his own authority to launch a nuclear first strike.

There is nothing to stop U.S. presidents from reining in their own nuclear command authority. When the United States is not under (or at imminent threat of) nuclear attack, the nuclear command and control system already contains some restraints on presidential authority, including military commanders trained to make sure that a nuclear launch order is legal. As Feaver told me in an interview that followed his Senate testimony, the president could order additional controls on nuclear decision making. “I don’t think that you could impose over a determinately hostile executive branch a legislative fix that actually would work,” he said. “But [Congress] could cooperate with the executive branch on legislative fixes, and better yet, it could, through oversight and review, make recommendations that the executive branch would adopt on its own, recognizing that they’re worth doing.”

Daniel DePetris: The least bad way to deal with Kim Jong Un

Just as the Obama administration laid out strict guidelines for authorizing drone attacks on terrorist targets, Feaver said, the Trump administration could adopt a policy that, for example, required certain cabinet members to determine whether a president’s first-strike nuclear order is legal and complies with U.S. treaty obligations before it can be acted on.

An executive order formally requiring that, for example, the secretaries of defense and state sign off on any presidential order of a first nuclear strike before it is sent to military commanders would go a great way toward assuaging concerns about presidential impulsiveness — particularly at a time when the North Korea confrontation looms large in the public consciousness. Such a “three-key” reform could therefore be of enormous political benefit to Trump, reassuring both domestic audiences and allied countries that he will not explode early some morning and, after an angry tweet or two, order up an attack on Pyongyang that triggers doomsday.

To have credibility, any such reforms would need to be closely vetted by congressional and military experts. They would have to ensure that while the presidential power to initiate first-strike attacks could be curbed, presidents could still respond immediately and effectively when the United States is under attack, or an attack is clearly impending. In matters pertaining to the continued existence of humanity, details matter.

Because they would be enacted by executive order, the reforms of course would not necessarily outlive the Trump administration; a future president could undo them by fiat.

But if they were wisely crafted, procedural safeguards against a president’s unilateral misuse of his authority to order a first nuclear strike would likely be welcomed by people in America and around the world, and those safeguards might serve as a powerful precedent. Beyond the political benefits these reforms would provide Trump today, they could serve as a long-term legacy for a president who so far has struggled to get major legislation passed.

Trump’s personality and leadership style make it highly unlikely that he’ll agree to limit his own powers.

Shafik, a former air force commander and government minister, has been seen as the strongest potential opponent of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is widely expected to run for a second term next year.

His family said Shafik was picked up at the family home in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday and taken by private plane back to Cairo. A Reuters witness said Egyptian authorities escorted him in a convoy from the airport.

UAE authorities confirmed he left the Emirates, but Egyptian officials have not commented on the case.

“We know nothing about him since he left home yesterday,” Shafik’s daughter May told Reuters. “His lawyer hasn’t been able to reach him. If we was deported he should have been able to go home by now.”

The family and lawyer said they planned to file complaints with the prosecutor’s office about Shafik’s whereabouts.

Egypt’s foreign ministry said it was not responsible for the case. The interior ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.

One Egyptian judicial source said Shafik, who narrowly lost a 2012 presidential election, did not face any criminal cases in Egypt. He was acquitted, or had charges dropped, in several cases in the past, including for corruption.

Sisi has yet to announce his own intentions for the presidential election, saying only he would follow the will of the people.

Critics say under Sisi’s presidency thousands of dissidents have been jailed, the government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of polls in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown.

His supporters dismiss criticism over rights abuses and say any measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist militant insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers in the last four years.

Shafik had said on Wednesday he would run for president in a surprise announcement from the UAE, where he has been based.. Several other lower-profile candidates have said they will run as well.

As military commander, Sisi led the ousting of former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, before winning his own landslide election a year later. Sisi’s supporters see him as key to stability after the upheaval following the 2011 revolt that toppled president Hosni Mubarak.

But his government is battling a stubborn Islamist militant group fighting in the North Sinai region and has also enacted painful austerity reforms over the last year to revive the economy but that critics say have eroded his popularity.",Ex premier's whereabouts unknown after return to Egypt - family,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DX08L-OZATP

The agreement on a range of often politically sensitive measures - covering fiscal issues, energy and labor market reforms, bad loans and privatizations - could open up fresh loans and push Greece further along the path toward a return to full market financing.

“The institutions’ visit is completed, we closed the staff level agreement,” Greece’s Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters on Saturday.

“The European institutions have reached a staff level agreement with the Greek authorities on the policy package supporting the ESM (European Stability Programme) program,” an EU statement said later on Saturday.

The agreement between Greek officials and European Union and International Monetary Fund representatives on the country’s compliance with reforms and future commitments must be approved by euro zone finance ministers, scheduled to meet on Dec. 4.

Under the deal, Athens will need to implement a broad set of reforms as part of the so-called third review of its bailout program.

Once concluded, the review is expected to release about five billion euros in loans from the current 86-billion-euro bailout program, its third since 2010. EU officials said this could be done before the end of January, if all proceeded smoothly.

At least another review of agreed reforms will be necessary before the end of the program in August.

Athens and its lenders had been exchanging drafts on agreed and proposed reforms for days. After seven years of austerity and rescue loans amounting to about 270 billion euros ($320 billion), Greece hopes its third bailout will be its last.

The government has been keen to swiftly conclude the review, which started in October, to begin talks on debt relief and the terms of the country’s exit from the bailout program.

“The speed with which this deal was reached is a signal that Greece is fully committed to conclude the program,” an EU official told Reuters.

The IMF’s full participation to the bailout program is still subject to the IMF assessment of the agreed reforms.

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

Young Sohn, the South Korean company’s Silicon Valley-based president and chief strategy officer, said he was keen for world’s top maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions to expand in automotive markets, digital health and industrial automation.

Samsung, which this year surpassed Intel to become the world’s biggest semiconductors manufacturer, has signaled its appetite for dealmaking over the past year, saying it was seeking businesses to build software and services to further differentiate its products.

However, it has provided few details on sectors it is targeting in its push for mergers and acquisitions.

“We are committed to using M&A as our tool, (and) I think the Harmon acquisition helped us to have more confidence,” Sohn told Reuters on the sidelines of the Slush tech start-up festival in Helsinki.

“I believe we can do lot more going forward.”

Sohn appeared to dismiss the potential for Samsung to take part in further consolidation in semiconductors or the smartphone markets, where it is also a leading player, suggesting the company is focused on organic growth strategies in these areas.

In September Sohn said Samsung aimed to become a major player in autonomous driving, building on its acquisition of auto parts supplier Harman and its pole position in mobile communications markets.

Asked to spell out Samsung’s potential dealmaking priorities for 2018, he said the company would continue to invest in expanding its automotive business.

Another category he singled out as “an area of opportunity” was digital health, specifically preventive health and related technologies.

Finally, in business software, he said Samsung is looking at companies in the areas of industrial internet, automation, networking, data transmission and security.

“We are a very careful and conservative company, so we will do it where it makes sense,” Sohn said, adding that it would also look for smaller bolt-on technology deals.","Samsung to chase big M&A deals on three fronts, says strategy chief",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-strategy-m-a/samsung-to-chase-big-ma-deals-on-three-fronts-says-strategy-chief-idUSKBN1DV5UZ

“The president’s going to take care of it by, if we have to, doing more ourselves. But what we want to do is convince others, it is in their interest to do more,” McMaster said.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea’s ballistic and nuclear weapons programs, including military ones, but that it still prefers a diplomatic option.",Pentagon should move U.S. dependents out of South Korea due to North Korean threat: senator,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-usa-graham/pentagon-should-move-u-s-dependents-out-of-south-korea-due-to-north-korean-threat-senator-idUSKBN1DX0OU

Schmidt pleaded guilty in August in the U.S. District Court in Detroit to wrongdoing connected to a massive diesel emissions scandal that has cost Volkswagen as much as $30 billion. He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 6.

“I must say that I feel misused by my own company in the diesel scandal or ‘Dieselgate’,” Schmidt wrote to U.S. judge Sean Cox, according to a letter filed in federal court.

The letter was originally published by Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment, citing the ongoing proceedings.

Under a plea agreement, Schmidt faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of between $40,000 and $400,000 after admitting to conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violating clean air laws.

In March, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three felony counts under a plea agreement to resolve U.S. charges it installed secret software in vehicles to evade emissions tests.

U.S. prosecutors have charged eight current and former Volkswagen executives.

Schmidt was in charge of the company’s environmental and engineering office in Auburn Hills, Michigan, until February 2015, where he oversaw emissions issues.

In the letter to the judge, he said he had agreed to follow a script, or talking points, agreed by Volkswagen management and a high-ranking lawyer, at a meeting with Alberto Ayala, a California Air Resources Board executive.

“In hindsight, I should never have agreed to meet with Dr Ayala on that day,” he wrote.

“Or better yet, I should have gone to that meeting and ignored the instructions given to me and told Dr Ayala that there is a defeat device in the VW diesel engine vehicles and that VW had been cheating for almost a decade. I did not do that and that is why I find myself here today.”

After being informed of the existence of the emissions software in the summer of 2015, according to his guilty plea, Schmidt conspired with other executives to avoid disclosing “intentional cheating” by the automaker in a bid to seek regulatory approval for its model 2016 VW 2 liter diesels.","Volkswagen 'misused' me, accused executive tells judge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions/volkswagen-misused-me-accused-executive-tells-judge-idUSKBN1DX0BW

Infantino was speaking alongside Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who also serves as the head of the Russian Football Union and the chairman of the tournament’s local organizing committee, ahead of the World Cup draw at the Kremlin.

“FIFA doesn’t participate in any speculations about any situation,” he said, referring to allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia that could see the country banned from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.

“These tests are not carried out in Russia and they are carried out by non-Russians,” Infantino told reporters.

“Obviously, as it was the case in the past and as will be the case in the future as well, if it turns out that anyone has committed a doping violation, has taken some doping, then there will be sanctions.”

Infantino added that the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) decision next week on Russia’s participation at the winter Games would have no impact on the World Cup, which will take place in 12 venues spread across 11 cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi.

Mutko vehemently denied the existence of state-backed doping in Russia and said the country was being unfairly targeted by international sports authorities.

“I am ready to go to any court, to any disciplinary body and say that there was never, isn’t and never will be any doping cover up program,” Mutko said. “We don’t need any of this.”

SUSPENDED SPORTS BODIES

Despite pledges to cooperate with international bodies to help rid Russia of deep-seated doping, the authorities have refused to acknowledge the findings of last year’s McLaren report that a state-sponsored program existed.

That refusal has thwarted Russia’s efforts to have its suspended sports organizations reinstated.

The country’s athletics federation, Paralympic committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA all remain suspended over doping scandals.

The report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), found that more than 1,000 Russian competitors in more than 30 sports were involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a period of five years.

“There can be endless accusations,” Mutko said. “But I can say that we didn’t create doping.”

Mutko stressed that Russia would continue to protect its athletes and fight the recent bans against suspected dope cheats.

“The state will take a firm position and will defend its athletes until the bitter end,” he said. “We trust and believe them. We will go to civil courts. We won’t leave things like this.”

Qualcomm in July accused Apple of infringing several patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life.

Apple has denied the claims that it violated Qualcomm’s battery life patents and alleged that Qualcomm’s patents were invalid, a common move in such cases.

But on Wednesday, in a filing in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Apple revised its answer to Qualcomm’s complaint with accusations of its own. Apple alleges it owns at least eight battery life patents that Qualcomm has violated.

The Apple patents involve ensuring each part of a phone’s processor draws only the minimum power needed, turning off parts of the processor when they are not needed and making sleep and wake functions work better.

In its filing, Apple alleges that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 and 820 processors, which power phones from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Alphabet Inc’s Google’s Pixel phones, infringe on those patents. Samsung and Google are not named in Apple’s counterclaims.

“Apple began seeking those patents years before Qualcomm began seeking the patents it asserts against Apple in this case,” the company wrote in its complaint.

Apple said it is seeking unspecified damages from San Diego-based Qualcomm.

Qualcomm filed its patent infringement lawsuit at the same time it filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban the import of Apple iPhones that use competing Intel Corp chips because of the alleged patent violations.

The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm over patents is part of a wide-ranging legal war between the two companies.

In January, Apple sued Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that Qualcomm allegedly withheld from Apple. In a related suit, Qualcomm sued the contract manufacturers that make Apple’s phones, but Apple joined in to defend them.

Separately, Qualcomm is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over many of the same pricing practices Apple names in its complaints.

Already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington have deteriorated as Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors, detailed in court a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions.

Erdogan said Turkey’s dealings were in line with the decisions of the United Nations, adding that they were not against Ankara’s alliance with Washington.

“What have we done, for example? We bought natural gas from a country we have an agreement with so our citizens wouldn’t be cold in the winter. Like other countries, only the U.N.’s decisions bind us, and Turkey followed them to the dot,” he told members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus.

Over three days of testimony, Zarrab has implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said on Thursday that when Erdogan was prime minister he had authorised a transaction to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

“This case is nothing more than the 17-25 December plot being carried across the ocean. Excuse us, but we will not succumb to this blackmail,” Erdogan said, referring to 2013 leaks about alleged government corruption which were blamed on his opponents.

Although he has not yet responded to the courtroom claims, Erdogan has dismissed the case as a politically motivated attempt to bring down the Turkish government, led by Gulen.

Turkey has repeatedly requested Gulen’s extradition, but U.S. officials have said the courts require sufficient evidence before they can extradite the elderly cleric, who has denied any involvement in the coup.

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE.

Schmidt pleaded guilty in August in the U.S. District Court in Detroit to wrongdoing connected to a massive diesel emissions scandal that has cost Volkswagen as much as $30 billion. He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 6.

“I must say that I feel misused by my own company in the diesel scandal or ‘Dieselgate’,” Schmidt wrote to U.S. judge Sean Cox, according to a letter filed in federal court.

The letter was originally published by Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment, citing the ongoing proceedings.

Under a plea agreement, Schmidt faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of between $40,000 and $400,000 after admitting to conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violating clean air laws.

In March, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three felony counts under a plea agreement to resolve U.S. charges it installed secret software in vehicles to evade emissions tests.

U.S. prosecutors have charged eight current and former Volkswagen executives.

Schmidt was in charge of the company’s environmental and engineering office in Auburn Hills, Michigan, until February 2015, where he oversaw emissions issues.

In the letter to the judge, he said he had agreed to follow a script, or talking points, agreed by Volkswagen management and a high-ranking lawyer, at a meeting with Alberto Ayala, a California Air Resources Board executive.

“In hindsight, I should never have agreed to meet with Dr Ayala on that day,” he wrote.

“Or better yet, I should have gone to that meeting and ignored the instructions given to me and told Dr Ayala that there is a defeat device in the VW diesel engine vehicles and that VW had been cheating for almost a decade. I did not do that and that is why I find myself here today.”

After being informed of the existence of the emissions software in the summer of 2015, according to his guilty plea, Schmidt conspired with other executives to avoid disclosing “intentional cheating” by the automaker in a bid to seek regulatory approval for its model 2016 VW 2 liter diesels.","Volkswagen 'misused' me, accused executive tells judge",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1DX0BW-OCABS

When rain forced an early end to day two of the second Ashes test, England were 29 for one in reply to Australia’s 442 for eight declared, having thrown their best at their hosts only to come off second best.

Two DRS referrals that overturned what looked to the naked eye to be plumb lbw decisions off the bowling of the luckless James Anderson were symptomatic of a day where little went right for the tourists.

When Alastair Cook and James Vince crashed into each other trying to take a simple catch to dismiss Shaun Marsh, who went on to make an unbeaten 126, memories of the 5-0 drubbing on the last Ashes tour Down Under started to surface.

England are already 1-0 down after a 10-wicket defeat at the Gabba but a defiant Bayliss was not prepared to surrender to the gloom only two days into the first day-night Ashes test.

“There’s a good feeling in the dressing room,” he told reporters.

”They’re certainly not disheartened at all. Shaun showed it’s not impossible to score runs out there. It will be up to one or our guys to go out and make a big score.

“We’re here to win. We’re not here to make up the numbers. That means batting all day tomorrow and well into the fourth day.”

The day started with Stuart Broad removing Peter Handscomb with the third delivery and for the first hour it looked like England’s bowlers had raised their game after putting Australia in and only taking four wickets on day one.

Although debutant seamer Craig Overton (3-105) ultimately ended the day as England’s biggest wicket-taker, Bayliss was not prepared to countenance the idea that his spearhead of Broad and Anderson was simply no longer good enough.

“Some days it goes your ways and some it doesn‘t,” he said.

”On that wicket the bowlers we’ve got are more than capable of taking wickets and creating chances, which I thought we did over the last day or two.

”It didn’t go our way on this occasion but these are the bowlers we’ve got, there’s no point wishing or hoping someone else is going to come along with a click of the fingers.

“I thought they both bowled extremely well.”

Bayliss also defended his captain Joe Root’s decision to bowl first after winning the toss on Saturday.

“He wouldn’t do anything different,” he said.

”It certainly wasn’t a decision that was taken lightly but for us to win games we’ve got to take 20 wickets.

“We bowled pretty well and didn’t get the rewards we thought we deserved.”",Cricket: Luckless England brace for uphill task in Adelaide,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-ashes-bayliss/cricket-luckless-england-brace-for-uphill-task-in-adelaide-idINKBN1DX0G1

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

When rain forced an early end to day two of the second Ashes test, England were 29 for one in reply to Australia’s 442 for eight declared, having thrown their best at their hosts only to come off second best.

Two DRS referrals that overturned what looked to the naked eye to be plumb lbw decisions off the bowling of the luckless James Anderson were symptomatic of a day where little went right for the tourists.

When Alastair Cook and James Vince crashed into each other trying to take a simple catch to dismiss Shaun Marsh, who went on to make an unbeaten 126, memories of the 5-0 drubbing on the last Ashes tour Down Under started to surface.

England are already 1-0 down after a 10-wicket defeat at the Gabba but a defiant Bayliss was not prepared to surrender to the gloom only two days into the first day-night Ashes test.

“There’s a good feeling in the dressing room,” he told reporters.

”They’re certainly not disheartened at all. Shaun showed it’s not impossible to score runs out there. It will be up to one or our guys to go out and make a big score.

“We’re here to win. We’re not here to make up the numbers. That means batting all day tomorrow and well into the fourth day.”

The day started with Stuart Broad removing Peter Handscomb with the third delivery and for the first hour it looked like England’s bowlers had raised their game after putting Australia in and only taking four wickets on day one.

Although debutant seamer Craig Overton (3-105) ultimately ended the day as England’s biggest wicket-taker, Bayliss was not prepared to countenance the idea that his spearhead of Broad and Anderson was simply no longer good enough.

“Some days it goes your ways and some it doesn‘t,” he said.

”On that wicket the bowlers we’ve got are more than capable of taking wickets and creating chances, which I thought we did over the last day or two.

”It didn’t go our way on this occasion but these are the bowlers we’ve got, there’s no point wishing or hoping someone else is going to come along with a click of the fingers.

“I thought they both bowled extremely well.”

Bayliss also defended his captain Joe Root’s decision to bowl first after winning the toss on Saturday.

“He wouldn’t do anything different,” he said.

”It certainly wasn’t a decision that was taken lightly but for us to win games we’ve got to take 20 wickets.

“We bowled pretty well and didn’t get the rewards we thought we deserved.”",Cricket: Luckless England brace for uphill task in Adelaide,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-ashes-bayliss/cricket-luckless-england-brace-for-uphill-task-in-adelaide-idINKBN1DX0G1?il=0

West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.

The accelerated pace of North Korea’s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.

On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday.

Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.

“It’s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,” the Alabama Congressman and Republican told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California.

When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill‎ said in a statement: “The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.”

The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department.

Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are “competing” for the missile defense installations.

Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites.

The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined.

THAAD is a ground-based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install.

In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed.

A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company “is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.” He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision.

In July, the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The successful test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military’s missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures.

Currently, the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD) in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships. The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD.

The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

North Korea’s latest missile test puts the U.S. capital within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday.",Exclusive: Pentagon evaluating U.S. West Coast missile defense sites - officials,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-westcoast-exclusive/exclusive-pentagon-evaluating-u-s-west-coast-missile-defense-sites-officials-idUSKBN1DX04W

The bread, made from flour ground from dried crickets as well as wheat flour and seeds, contains more protein than normal wheat bread. Each loaf contains about 70 crickets and costs 3.99 euros ($4.72), compared with 2 to 3 euros for a regular wheat loaf.

“It offers consumers with a good protein source and also gives them an easy way to familiarize themselves with insect-based food,” said Juhani Sibakov, head of innovation at Fazer Bakeries.

The demand to find more food sources and a desire to treat animals more humanely have raised interest in using insects as a protein source in several Western countries.

In November, Finland joined five other European countries - Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark - in allowing insects to be raised and marketed for food use.

Sibakov said Fazer had developed the bread since last summer. It had to wait for legislation to be passed in Finland for the launch.

“I don’t taste the difference ... It tastes like bread,” said Sara Koivisto, a student from Helsinki after trying the new product.

Due to a limited supply of crickets, the insect-bread will initially only be sold in 11 Fazer bakery stores located in Helsinki region hypermarkets, but the company plans to offer it in all 47 of its stores by next year.

The company buys its cricket flour from the Netherlands, but said it was also looking for local suppliers.

Fazer, a family business with sales of about 1.6 billion euros last year, did not give a sales target for the product.

Insect-eating, or entomophagy, is common in much of the world. The United Nations estimated last year that at least 2 billion people eat insects and more than 1,900 species have been used for food.

In Western countries, edible bugs are gaining traction in niche markets, particularly among those seeking a gluten-free diet or wanting to protect the environment because farming insects uses less land, water and feed than animal husbandry.",Finland baker launches bread made from crushed crickets,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DN17E

Coalition aircraft bombed Houthi positions in Sanaa overnight, residents and local media said, aiming to shore up supporters of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh as they battle the Houthi group, which is aligned with Iran.

It was the fourth day of clashes in which dozens have been killed, the Red Cross said.

“There is a plane on stand-by in Djibouti for 140 international staff,” a U.N. official in Sanaa told Reuters. About half were from non-governmental organizations, he said.

“Fighting is moving toward the airport and the situation is very tense. We can’t even evacuate staff,” he said.

United Nations staff have been confined to their living quarters in Sanaa since clashes erupted on Thursday, he said.

Shells were falling near the UN compound in Sanaa on Siteen Street on Sunday, with one source on the scene saying stray bullets had hit the compound. The compound is empty as staff had been told to stay at home and not report to work.

Another aid worker with an independent agency in Yemen, who declined to be identified, said the U.N. was planning to evacuate as many as 180 U.N. and other aid workers, but U.N. officials considered the airport road was not safe enough.

Russell Geekie, a U.N. humanitarian spokesman in New York, said the U.N. planned to reduce the number of non-essential staff in Sanaa, but they could not yet safely move, and exact numbers were unclear due to the fluidity of the situation.

“We’re very concerned by the clashes in Sanaa city, which have reportedly resulted in civilian deaths and have negative implications for the humanitarian response,” Geekie said in an emailed response to Reuters.

“At present, fighting is restricting movement within the city, including on the airport road. The airport remains closed with Sanaa residents holed up in their homes.”

Clearance to land at Sanaa airport has yet to be received from the coalition, who control the skies over the Houthi-controlled capital, aid workers said.

Saleh said on Saturday he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the coalition fighting in Yemen if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens, in a move that could pave the way to end nearly three years of war.

The apparent shift in position came as Saleh’s supporters battled Houthi fighters in Hadda, a district in southern Sanaa where members of Saleh’s family, including his nephew Tareq, live.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

At the moment, the process is seamless.

But Sheridan sees a threat to his life’s work, his family’s future and even the settlement that ended years of violence in British-ruled Northern Ireland should checkpoints reappear after Brexit on the “invisible” frontier with the Irish Republic.

“It’s crazy, crazy stuff. It absolutely cannot happen here. There cannot be a border - and that’s before even talking about the peace,” said Sheridan, a 56-year-old Protestant brought up in the pro-British unionist tradition.

Almost 18 months after Britain voted to leave the EU, the future of the only UK land frontier with the bloc after Brexit - and its role in sustaining about 20 years of fragile peace in Northern Ireland - is a major hurdle in the divorce talks.

Armed with a power of veto, the Irish government says the negotiations cannot progress unless Britain agrees to keep customs regulations the same north and south. This, Dublin says, is the only way of avoiding a damaging return to border controls.

Only road signs mark the frontier between the two member states of the EU’s single market, within which goods and people move freely. Trucks like those carrying Sheridan’s lambs rumble past the remains of disused checkpoints, built by the British army during three decades of political and sectarian violence that was settled by the 1998 peace deal.

For Sheridan, any change after Brexit in March 2019 to this smooth, tariff-free movement of livestock and common standards in both jurisdictions could spell ruin for the business he is in the process of passing on to his three children.

“If there’s a hard border, we’ll be pulling out. It will become a wasteland here,” said Sheridan, whose farm near the County Fermanagh village of Florencecourt lies only 3 km (2 miles) from the border.

Sheridan, who belongs to a campaign group called “Border Communities against Brexit”, has a warning for any politicians who upset the status quo. “Do you think I‘m going to let them ruin my business that took blood, sweat and tears to build, and ruin my family’s future in our country that we want to live in? Do you think anybody’s going to put up with that?”

The economy of Ireland, north and south, has become deeply integrated since the single market’s creation in 1993. This, along with peace, has transformed previously neglected border areas such as rural County Fermanagh which depends largely on tourism and agriculture.

According to the Ulster Farmers’ Union, 40 percent of all Northern Irish lambs are processed in the republic. A quarter of milk output also moves south, the Dairy UK trade body says, and around 60 percent of Northern Ireland’s processing capacity is owned by dairy co-operatives from the republic.

If common standards cease in areas such as labelling and product traceability, business north and south “will grind to a halt”, Mike Johnston, Dairy UK’s Northern Ireland Director, told a UK parliamentary committee earlier this year.

“BREXIT MEANS BREXIT”

The dismantling of military border posts was a vital aspect of the peace deal between Catholic nationalists seeking a united Ireland and Protestant unionists who wanted to keep Northern Ireland British. Over 3,600 died in the conflict.

Already the province’s government is suspended due to a row between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the nationalist Sinn Fein, which vehemently opposes a hard border. The parties have shared power under the 1998 settlement, and any rupture over the issue risks seriously upsetting the peace process.

Britain says it will not contemplate the return of a hard border but a committee of UK lawmakers has found that this is inconsistent with its plans to leave the EU’s single market and customs union.

Room for any special arrangements for Northern Ireland is further limited as the minority Conservative government relies on the pro-Brexit DUP to prop it up in Westminster.

The DUP has said it will not support any deal that makes the province operate under different rules from the rest of the UK or creates trade barriers between it and its biggest market.

North-South trade has doubled since 1995, but the British economy is 14 times larger than the Irish Republic‘s. The Northern Ireland food and drink sector, for instance, relies on Britain for 73 percent of its sales.

Despite Sheridan’s misgivings, many of his fellow Protestants stand squarely behind the DUP. At the party’s annual conference last month, supporters waving Union Jack flags belted out a rousing rendition of “God Save The Queen”.

“Brexit means Brexit, so we are going out,” William Gibson, a north Belfast businessman, said at the conference. “We are an integral part of the UK and it is most important that we are treated the same way as the rest of the UK.”

The DUP was the only Northern Irish party to campaign for Brexit in last year’s referendum, when 56 percent of voters in the province went against the national trend by opting to remain in the EU.

Many of the 10 DUP lawmakers who hold the balance of power in London suspect Dublin’s motives. They fear its proposals will boost the case for uniting the two sides of the border, as ultimately sought by their nationalist rivals.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney assured unionists on Friday that his government was only trying to maintain the status quo, “and nothing else”.

A DELICATE SOLUTION

The DUP, which also wants to maintain a soft border but has not spelled out how, has hinted it may withdraw its support for the government if Prime Minister Theresa May gives too much away.

A delicate solution is therefore needed if EU leaders are to agree at a summit on Dec. 14-15 - one described by Dublin as having historic significance for the island - that sufficient progress has been made to move the Brexit talks onto a trade deal, as London wants.

This can be achieved, a report prepared by Belfast’s Queen’s University for the European Parliament found this week, but it added: “This process is entirely dependent not on technical solutions but on political will.”

Sheridan will be watching closely from his farm in the Fermanagh constituency of DUP leader Arlene Foster. Dublin, he says, must hold a firm line. “There can be no turning back the clock.”","Fearing for post-Brexit prosperity and peace, farmers demand invisible Irish border",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland-border/fearing-for-post-brexit-prosperity-and-peace-farmers-demand-invisible-irish-border-idUKKBN1DV56B

Morocco recalled its ambassador from South Africa in 2004 after former South African president Thabo Mbeki recognised a breakaway region in the Western Sahara which Morocco claims as part of its territory.

“Morocco is an African nation and we need to have relations with them,” Zuma told City Press in the interview. “We never had problems with them anyway; they were the first to withdraw diplomatic relations.”

Zuma met Morocco’s King Mohammed last week on the sidelines of an African Union-European Union summit.

“They felt that even if we differ on the Western Sahara issues, the two countries should have a relationship,” Zuma said about Moroccan officials’ position at the meeting.

South Africa’s official government position - as re-affirmed by Zuma in one of his state of the nation addresses - is to support “self determination and decolonisation for the Western Sahara”.

The decision to re-establish ties with Morocco is likely to go down badly in South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, of which Zuma is leader.

The ANC - as one of Africa’s oldest liberation movements - has long backed those seeking independence in the Western Sahara and has accused Morocco of occupying the region.

A spokesman for South Africa’s foreign ministry could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Earlier this year, Apple said that developers had earned roughly $70 billion in total revenue through the store.

Apple is facing criticism from local users and rights groups for bowing to pressure from Beijing cyber regulators after it decided to remove hundreds of apps from its Chinese store this year, including messaging apps and virtual private network (VPN) services, which help users subvert China’s Great Firewall.

Apple counts China as its third-largest region by sales but it has lost market share in recent years as high-end handsets from local rivals continue to gain traction. The firm is hoping to regain momentum following the release of its iPhone 8 and iPhone X models which shipped in November.

The U.S. tech giant said earlier it had moved its Chinese cloud data onto the servers of a local partner in the Chinese province of Guizhou.

“I am seeing signals, news that some businessmen are trying to move their assets abroad, and I call on firstly my cabinet from here to never allow this exit for any of them because these people are traitors,” Erdogan said.

Speaking to members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus, Erdogan did not say to whom he was referring, nor did he single out a single business, person or country of destination.

His comments come after the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Friday that Turkish prosecutors were set to seize the assets of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in the trial of a Turkish bank executive charged with evading U.S. sanctions on Iran, and his acquaintances.

The trial has caused already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington to deteriorate further as Zarrab detailed in court a scheme to evade the U.S. sanctions, saying that Erdogan personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when prime minister.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East.

Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to “discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern”, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.

“It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and holds a very high risk of provoking Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities in the West,” said the diplomatic source, asking not to be named.

King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.

Word of Trump’s planned announcement, which would deviate from previous U.S. presidents who have insisted the Jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority and was sure to anger the broader Arab world.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel’s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city’s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/saudi-led-air-strikes-support-yemens-saleh-as-he-shifts-against-houthis-idUSKBN1DX07O?il=0

Responding to improving demand, manufacturers cranked up output for the fourth month in a row, and hired new workers at the fastest pace in five years.

That suggests a drag on the economy caused by the shock removal of higher-value currency bills from circulation in November 2016 and the roll-out of a goods and services tax (GST) this July has faded.

November’s Nikkei/IHS Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 52.6 from 50.3 in October, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted a more modest rise to 51.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth.

The reading was the strongest in 13 months.

A new orders sub-index bounced back into expansionary territory to 54.2 in November from 49.9 the month before. Export orders improved slightly after contracting in the previous two months.

The findings add to evidence that a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy is on track.

Data on Thursday showed growth rebounded to 6.3 percent annually in the quarter to September, from a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the previous period.

“India’s manufacturing economy advanced on its path to recovery as disruptions from the recent tax reform (GST) continues to diminish,” said Aashna Dodhia, economist at IHS Markit.

“Growth in output and new orders picked up to the fastest since October 2016, reportedly supported by reductions in GST rates and stronger underlying demand conditions.”

In order to help reduce the burden and confusion of the new nationwide tax on businesses, the government moved most goods which had attracted the highest rate to a band lower.

But cost pressures remained strong in November, and may push inflation to breach the Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target of 4 percent.

“Underlying data indicated that the central bank is less likely to adopt an accommodative stance as input cost inflation intensified to the fastest since April,” said Dodhia.

The Reserve Bank of India is likely to keep interest rates steady at its policy meeting next week, with stronger inflation expectations leaving it little room to ease, a recent Reuters poll of economists showed.",Indian November factory growth fastest since late 2016 currency shock - PMI,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-pmi/indian-november-factory-growth-fastest-since-late-2016-currency-shock-pmi-idINKBN1DV3PE

The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added.

The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N).

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

“(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.",Aetna's board set to approve $68 billion sale to CVS Health: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/aetnas-board-set-to-approve-68-billion-sale-to-cvs-health-sources-idUSKBN1DX0NC

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DX07O-OCATP

Now, as she nears the end of her four-year term, the problem remains a mystery, and not only in the United States.

In many countries, more people are in work than before the global financial crisis as the world economy racks up its strongest growth since 2010.

But pay, which would normally rise more quickly as employers compete for staff, is rising painfully slowly for many.

The living standards hit has big implications, fuelling the frustration of many voters who have dealt stinging rebukes to establishment candidates in elections around the world, most notably the victory of U.S. President Donald Trump last year.

And if the pattern doesn’t change soon, it’s likely to take its toll on many of the world’s advanced economies in 2019 just as they finally emerge from the hangover of the financial crisis, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says.

U.S. data due on Friday is expected to show another solid month for job creation in November but more attention is likely to be on workers’ earnings which showed the weakest rise in a year-and-a-half in October, up by an annual 2.4 percent.

That’s an improvement from growth of less than 2 percent as recently 2015 but before the financial crisis, American wages were growing by as much as 3.6 percent a year.

The weak wage numbers raise big questions about how fast inflation is likely to pick up - it has undershot the Fed’s target for more than five years - and how many more interest rate hikes the U.S. central bank is likely to make in response.

The Fed is widely expected to raise rates for the third time in 2017 on Dec. 13 and investors are more on edge about what message it will send about its plans 2018.

If wage growth is weak in the United States, the picture is bleaker for workers in many other countries.

In Britain, workers are facing the prospect of nearly two lost decades for earnings growth, taking inflation into account, according to new official forecasts.

For OECD economies overall, real wage growth is projected to remain moderate, barely picking up speed over the next couple of years, the Paris-based organisation says.

Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh, said there were signs that some U.S. employers were starting to raise their pay.

U.S. retailer Target Corp said in September it would increase its minimum hourly wage this year by a dollar to $11 (£8) and to $15 an hour by the end of 2020.

“But the uptrend is very gentle,” Milligan said.

Economists think the cause of the global earnings slowdown, at least in part, has to do with escalating competition in the world economy, and the rise of giant online corporations such as Amazon and Uber, which is squeezing many employers.

Yellen has said she thinks America’s tight labour markets will ultimately lead to rising prices. But her successor Jerome Powell, who replaces her in February, has yet to show how convinced he is.

While the Fed is likely to have to wait longer than its meeting in December for signs of a sustained pickup in pay growth, it will have a good sense of the fate of President Trump’s plans to cut corporate and individual taxes which have the potential to speed up growth and inflation more quickly.

Politics are key to the economic outlook in Europe too, especially with the Brexit negotiations entering a key phase.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels on Monday.

After long-awaited signs of progress on key issues such as the size of Britain’s Brexit divorce bill, sterling has risen in recent days, hitting a two-month high against the U.S. dollar.

If Monday’s meeting is deemed by Brussels to have produced sufficient progress, then EU leaders could give a green light to trade talks at a summit on Dec. 14-15, reducing the risk of a chaotic British departure from the bloc.

Britain’s economy is growing more slowly than most of its European peers and investors are watching for signs that the euro zone recovery can keep up its recovery.

The tourists, who sent the Australians in to bat after winning the toss on Saturday, had made 29 for one in reply when rain brought a premature end to the day’s play at Adelaide Oval.

It looked like something of a reprieve for England, who had already lost Mark Stoneman for 18 to leave Alastair Cook, unbeaten on 11, and James Vince, yet to score, facing a night assault from Australia’s pace battery.

Marsh had earlier put the hosts on the front foot with his fifth test century, a 231-ball vindication of the decision by the Australian selectors to hand the 34-year-old his eighth test recall.

”We knew if we could bat for most of the day and put them in under lights we’d be a chance,“ Marsh told reporters. ”To be nice and patient, and get a hundred there at the end was pleasing.

“It’s great to be playing for Australia and just to be out there in the middle.”

Marsh had to grit it out at times as England produced a much improved bowling performance after a disappointing day one and had the Decision Review System (DRS) to thank for a life after initially being given out lbw to James Anderson on 29.

Tim Paine, who joined Marsh at the crease when Stuart Broad dismissed Peter Handscomb lbw with the third delivery of the day, was similarly reprieved when tracking showed an Anderson delivery would have gone over the stumps.

Marsh put on 85 with Paine as the two most controversial selections in the Australia squad for the first two tests frustrated England before the wicketkeeper holed out for 57 -- a third test half century coming seven years after his second.

DROPPED CATCH

The left-hander then put together a stand of 99 with Pat Cummins, reaching the hundred mark in the process with a sumptuous pull off a Chris Woakes delivery which raced to the square leg boundary for his 12th four.

The batsman whipped off his helmet to acknowledge the applause of another bumper crowd at the Adelaide Oval and almost immediately had another reprieve when Cook and James Vince collided in the gully with neither able to take a simple catch.

Slideshow (9 Images)

If much of Marsh’s progress to the century had been a stop-start affair, there was nothing cautious about the way he punished the tourists for their profligacy after the break as Steve Smith pondered the declaration.

With Cummins initially providing back-up with his highest test score, a seven-boundary 44, Marsh added three more fours and a punishing straight six off Broad to finish unbeaten on 126 when Smith finally called him in.

“Some days it goes your ways and some it doesn‘t,” England coach Trevor Bayliss said.

“There’s a good feeling in the dressing room. They’re certainly not disheartened at all. Shaun showed it’s not impossible to score runs out there. It will be up to one of our guys to go out and make a bit score, not just 40 or 50.”

England, already 1-0 down in the five-match series after a 10-wicket loss in Brisbane last week, made a reasonable start before Mitchell Starc sent down a fizzing yorker that trapped Stoneman in front.

To add insult to injury on a day when the DRS had worked so well for Australia, Stoneman referred the decision, only for the tracking to show the ball would have clattered into his leg stump.",Cricket: Marsh century puts Australia in charge in Adelaide,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-ashes/cricket-marsh-century-puts-australia-in-charge-in-adelaide-idINKBN1DX06B?il=0

Coalition aircraft bombed Houthi positions in Sanaa overnight, residents and local media said, aiming to shore up supporters of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh as they battle the Houthi group, which is aligned with Iran.

It was the fourth day of clashes in which dozens have been killed, the Red Cross said.

“There is a plane on stand-by in Djibouti for 140 international staff,” a U.N. official in Sanaa told Reuters. About half were from non-governmental organisations, he said.

“Fighting is moving towards the airport and the situation is very tense. We can’t even evacuate staff,” he said.

United Nations staff have been confined to their living quarters in Sanaa since clashes erupted on Thursday, he said.

Shells were falling near the UN compound in Sanaa on Siteen Street on Sunday, with one source on the scene saying stray bullets had hit the compound. The compound is empty as staff had been told to stay home and not report to work for days.

Another aid worker from an independent agency in Yemen, who declined to be identified, told Reuters: “The U.N. is planning a reduction of staff for U.N. agencies and some NGOs.”

“But more importantly they consider that the road to the airport is not safe enough to organise a movement to the airport,” he said, adding that it might involve evacuation of a total of 180 aid workers.

There was no immediate reply from the United Nations to Reuters queries seeking confirmation of the reports.

Clearance to land at Sanaa airport has yet to be received from the coalition, who control the skies over the Houthi-controlled capital, aid workers said.

Saleh said on Saturday he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the coalition fighting in Yemen if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens, in a move that could pave the way to end nearly three years of war.

The apparent shift in position came as Saleh’s supporters battled Houthi fighters in Hadda, a district in southern Sanaa where members of Saleh’s family, including his nephew Tareq, live.

Another UN source in Yemen said: “UN and NGO staff are not evacuating, but rather planning a reduction in the number of non-essential staff in Sanaa until the security situation on the ground is clearer.”

In Geneva, spokeswoman Elodie Schindler of the International Committee of the Red Cross said: “In light of the current chaotic situation, the ICRC is looking to downsize staff presence in Yemen to a core team”.",U.N. seeking to evacuate aid workers from Yemen - sources tell Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-yemen-security-aidworkers/u-n-seeking-to-evacuate-aid-workers-from-yemen-sources-tell-reuters-idUKKBN1DX0IY?il=0

The chancellor of the exchequer must shore up Theresa May’s perilously shaky government ahead of a vital Brexit summit of European leaders in mid-December. At the same time Hammond has to keep a grip on the public finances. But the gravest challenge he faces is economic: Britain’s persistent productivity blight.

Productivity – output per hour worked – is the mainspring of economic growth. In the decade before the financial crisis of 2007-08 productivity was increasing in Britain by just over 2 percent a year, outpacing the average for the other economies of the G7. But since the crisis British performance has been dismal. Although productivity jumped in the third quarter of 2017, prolonged weakness means that it is barely higher than its pre-crisis peak a decade ago. The recovery in GDP has been driven overwhelmingly by more labor input, a source of growth that is running dry – not least since the vote to leave the European Union delivered a message to curb immigration.

Other advanced economies have also experienced setbacks to productivity growth following the financial crisis. Where Britain stands out is in the severity of its reverse. The shortfall in productivity is the main reason real wages are now 4 percent lower than 10 years ago, a potent reason why the leave campaign prevailed in the Brexit referendum.

Productivity is so central to prosperity and to macroeconomic management – by determining how fast the economy can sustainably grow – that a gaggle of economic researchers have been busy in their labs trying to diagnose the now decade-long disease. Early detective work highlighted the impact of the financial crisis itself, which was especially severe in Britain. This held back productivity by throttling bank credit to new potentially fast-growing ventures and by jamming up the usual way in which capital moves from declining to advancing sectors.

But as the crisis has receded and British banks have become better capitalized this explanation is less convincing. Longer-term forces appear to be in play in Britain and elsewhere. Firms at the technological frontier continue to forge ahead in raising productivity. However, the diffusion of their best practices within economies has slowed. An aging workforce is now acting as a drag. And the contribution to productivity from improved educational attainment is falling.

Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond will deliver his budget to the House of Commons on Nov. 22, 2017 REUTERS/Mary Turner

One reason the productivity setback has been particularly severe in Britain is that its apparently robust performance before the crisis was overstated and unsustainable. Banking activities ballooned on the basis of what turned out to be economically and socially harmful practices such as risky securitizations. Despite making up less than a tenth of the economy, the financial sector has been responsible for nearly a third of the productivity slowdown. Longstanding weaknesses in qualifications and skills have also become more damaging as business becomes more knowledge-based. Over a quarter of British working-age adults perform poorly in numeracy or literacy or both.

Investment is inadequate, too. Although firms have stepped up their capital spending after it collapsed during the recession, they have done much less so than in previous recoveries. Business investment is only 5 percent above its pre-crisis high a decade ago. At a similar stage in the recoveries following recessions at the start of 1980s and of the 1990s it was 63 percent and 30 percent higher than the respective previous peaks.

The reluctance to invest in turn is rooted in a financial and business culture that is especially and perniciously short-termist in Britain. Firms under pressure from the markets are reluctant to make the strategic investments needed to keep productivity moving ahead. And too many British managers are simply not good enough.

Although a definitive diagnosis of the British productivity disease remains elusive there is a surprising degree of consensus about the treatment needed to resuscitate the patient. The chancellor’s to-do list should include steps to tackle congested roads and overcrowded trains, to support the sciences, to foster R&D in the private sector, and to upgrade Britain’s poor skills. Since competition spurs higher productivity as new and smarter firms drive out older and less productive businesses, Hammond needs Britain to be as open an economy as possible.

The remedies make good sense but they will not rescue the chancellor, who has in any case already announced more spending on infrastructure. First, they will take time to be effective. Second, finding more money for austerity-hit public services such as policing and health will add to the pressures on the public finances. And third, Brexit is now contributing to the productivity malaise as businesses respond to corrosive uncertainties by curbing their investment plans and as Britain becomes less open to trade by leaving the EU. Raising taxes is always an option for a cash-strapped chancellor, but it would be highly unpopular − not least in the bitterly divided Conservative party.

When he presents his budget, Hammond can be expected to put a brave face on things. He will point to the fall in the budget deficit from a peak of almost 10 percent of GDP after the financial crisis to 2.3 percent of GDP in the financial year ending in March 2017. But what matters now is the future path of the public finances. Britain’s poor productivity prospects will box the chancellor in because GDP is the tax base and future revenues will be smaller to the extent that output per hour worked continues to stall.

The harsh reality is that Brexit will blight the public finances by hurting productivity. While Prime Minister May might see Britain’s overriding priority as ensuring that next month’s summit enables the Brexit talks to move on to trade, she’ll have to broaden her focus if she hopes to stay in office long enough to secure a deal that minimizes the damage Brexit is inflicting on the economy.",Commentary: Britain’s gravest economic challenge isn’t Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-productivity-commentary/commentary-britains-gravest-economic-challenge-isnt-brexit-idUSKBN1DK05N

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,https://www.reuters.com/article/yemen-security/saudi-led-air-strikes-support-yemens-saleh-as-he-shifts-against-houthis-idINKBN1DX0JQ

A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East.

Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to “discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern”, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.

“It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and holds a very high risk of provoking Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities in the West,” said the diplomatic source, asking not to be named.

King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.

Word of Trump’s planned announcement, which would deviate from previous U.S. presidents who have insisted the Jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority and was sure to anger the broader Arab world.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel’s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city’s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.

What’s clear, though, is that the current approach is not fit for an increasingly intangible world.","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The modern economy is an intangible economy. In “Capitalism without Capital”, economics professor Jonathan Haskel and policy advisor Stian Westlake deliver an important and thought-provoking account of why this matters. They show how current policies are inadequate to tackle emerging social and economic challenges. But the book falls short of addressing the pressing issue of how to rein in dominant tech companies like Facebook and Google.

Companies have always invested in hard-to-grasp items like research and development, design and human talent. Computers and the internet have brought spending on software and systems. The big shift is how important these factors have become for modern economies. Since the start of the 21st century, intangible investments have overtaken tangible ones in developed countries including the United States and United Kingdom.

To illustrate this phenomenon consider Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation. Traditional assets such as plant and equipment account for just 9 percent of the assets on its balance sheet and a mere 4 percent of its $880 billion market value. Rivals Alphabet and Microsoft also have very little in the way of physical assets. What makes these companies valuable are factors not captured by conventional accounting, like Apple’s premium brand and supply-chain prowess.

Haskel and Westlake draw on numerous examples and economic research to bolster their arguments on how the rise of intangibles has impacted businesses, societies, labour and financial markets. Their thesis is that intangible assets have fundamentally different characteristics from physical ones. The authors call these the “four S‘s”: they are scalable, have sunk costs, their benefits spill over, and they have synergies with other intangibles.

This framework leads to a thought-provoking analysis of two complex issues faced by many developed countries: the fall in investment and productivity growth in major economies – often summarised as the “secular stagnation” hypothesis – and rising wealth inequality. The growing importance of intangible assets, the authors argue, helps explain persistent low productivity and even the rise of populist political movements.

First, innovative ideas can be used and re-used in multiple places at the same time. This scalability has allowed a relatively small number of dominant firms to emerge. Companies like Facebook can build up massive user bases, making it prohibitively expensive for anyone else to compete in what become winner-takes-all markets. The remaining laggards have even less incentive to invest as the profit gap widens.

The authors rightly acknowledge that intangible investments also encourage rent-seeking practices such as patent trolling and tax avoidance. These “do no good for the economy ... but instead are about slicing the existing economic pie to the exclusive benefit of the intangible investor.” This is a particularly timely issue, given the growing backlash against big pharmaceutical groups as well as companies like Uber, which stands accused of circumventing existing regulations. The immense influence and dominance of Facebook and Google have also come under fierce scrutiny.

Second, the synergies and benefit spillovers from intangible investments mean densely-populated cities are more likely to attract top talent and companies. That in turn pushes up the value of urban real estate, which makes up a significant share of new wealth for the very rich. More speculatively, the authors suggest the people who benefit from the intangible economy tend to be more open to new ideas. Though it’s overly simplistic to attribute widening social and economic divisions to this development, the book offers a nuanced and fresh way to understand economic winners and losers.

What can governments do? The book offers some sensible if at times clichéd policy prescriptions. Governments should improve and clarify protection for intellectual property rights, adopt effective urban planning policies, and provide tax breaks and other incentives to encourage financial markets to invest in and lend more to businesses.

Haskel and Westlake’s suggestions for tackling inequality are more disappointing. To be fair, the authors admit they do not have the solution. Yet they half-heartedly suggest that policymakers should “encourage trust and strong institutions, encourage opportunity, mitigate divisive social conflict, and prevent powerful firms from indulging in rent seeking.” The question of whether governments can or should do more to curb the power of dominant tech companies is left unanswered.

There is no simple answer to how governments should respond to the challenges raised in this book. What’s clear, though, is that the current approach is not fit for an increasingly intangible world.",Breakingviews - Review: Firm ideas for a world of soft assets,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-economics-breakingviews/breakingviews-review-firm-ideas-for-a-world-of-soft-assets-idUSKBN1DV5CH

Led by companies such as Qudian Inc and PPDAI Group Inc, the Chinese micro-lenders raised $1.2 billion with splashy U.S. listings, cashing in on a boom in borrowing by consumers in China with little access to traditional banks.

However, the fortunes – and share prices – of the micro-lenders have slumped in the past week as Beijing clamped down on risks in the financial system, zeroing in on the fast-growing and loosely-regulated market for unsecured “cash loans”.

On Friday, China’s financial regulators introduced new measures aimed at restricting the industry, which is estimated to be worth 1 trillion yuan ($151.5 billion).

China has long been known as a nation of savers, but consumers are rapidly embracing debt from non-bank online platforms. The number borrowers taking out cash loans from the micro-lenders is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the lending companies and the government.

For borrowers, the easy loans can be a risky proposition – especially if they fall behind on payments. The loans are usually in the range of 1,000 yuan; interest is typically about 36 percent annually, and penalty charges and compound interest can quickly add up, according to borrowers.

The number of repeat borrowers is rising, which could signal financial stress on borrowers, analysts say. The companies, however, say the repeat lending is just a sign of the attractiveness of their platforms.

The People’s Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission did not respond to faxed requests for comment.

Angel Xiao, 23, who lives in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen and does not own a credit card, said she borrowed 10,000 yuan last year from two online lenders, PPDAI and Flower Wallet, to attend a jewellery design class.

But after she lost her job as a tutor, she found herself unable to pay back the initial loans. With interest piling up, Xiao eventually took out a series of new loans, with an average maturity of 14 days, from more than 30 other lenders.

“I didn’t have money to repay loans coming due,” she said in an exchange on WeChat, a messaging service. “So I took out more loans. Every time when I didn’t have money, I used new loans to repay old loans. That’s how I got trapped deeper and deeper.” China Rapid Finance Ltd, an online micro-lender that raised $60 million in an April listing on the New York Stock Exchange, defended its cash loan business.

In a statement, it said that its target customers have little or no history with China’s credit bureau, but that they “are prime and near-prime borrowers”, and that it only grants new loans to borrowers who have repaid in full all prior loans granted by the company. It also said the rates it charges are affordable.

In its third-quarter earnings report, China Rapid Finance’s repeat borrower rate was 75 percent.

BOOMING MARKET

Online consumer lending in China, of which cash loans are a significant portion, dwarfs similar activity in the rest of the world combined, accounting for over 85 percent of all such activity globally last year, according to a recent report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.The boom in micro-lending comes as lenders seek to cash in on rising incomes in a country where credit card penetration remains at about one-third of the population, according to data from the central bank, which says about half a billion consumers don’t have a credit score. And the online cash loan sector is projected to reach 2.3 trillion yuan by 2020, according to the research firm iResearch.

China Rapid Finance in November reported a 514 percent year-on-year increase in short-term consumer lending in the third quarter to $908 million. PPDAI‘S “handy cash loans”, with maturities of one to six weeks, increased more than 10 fold year-on-year to 1.98 billion yuan in the second quarter, it said. Qudian recorded a 695 percent increase in net income for the first six months this year, it said in its listing prospectus. Qudian and PPDAI declined to comment.

In addition to the companies that have already listed on U.S. markets, another Chinese lender, LexinFintech Holdings Ltd, filed for a Nasdaq listing in mid-November hoping to raise $500 million.

LexinFintech said in a statement on Friday that it “continues to work toward those objectives as described” in its filing.

LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

The explosion in online lending to those without access to traditional banks has raised concerns about the risks of default. Outstanding household debt in China equalled 45.5 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the first quarter, according to the Bank of International Settlements, compared to 27.9 percent five years ago.

But that total doesn’t include most online consumer lending, analysts say.

“It is entirely fair to say household debt is much higher than is understood,” said Professor Christopher Balding at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen. He estimated that household debt could be over 100 percent of household income in China.

Nearly 40 percent of Chinese households lack savings, higher than even the U.S. rate, meaning their cash buffer to pay off debt is limited, said Lu Xiaomeng, a researcher at the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

The cash loan industry is largely “supply-driven”, said Johnson Zhang, chief financial officer at the Chinese peer-to-peer lender Hexindai Inc. “Whether there is real demand and whether borrowers will be able to pay them back are questionable,” he said, emphasizing that his company only accepted borrowers with credit cards.",China's debt crackdown hits cash loan providers,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-loans/chinas-debt-crackdown-hits-cash-loan-providers-idINKBN1DW05A

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said. But they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when.

Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump aides.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump said on Twitter while he was in New York for a fundraising trip. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Flynn, who on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who was Trump’s national security adviser only for 24 days. He was forced to resign after he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak.

“What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for the New York trip. “There’s been absolutely no collusion, so we’re very happy.”

Establishing when Trump was told Flynn lied to the FBI agents could be key to determining if the president acted improperly.

According to a person familiar with the matter, during a conversation between White House counsel Don McGahn and then-acting attorney general Sally Yates in January, Yates told McGahn that Flynn had told FBI agents the same thing he had told Pence.

This was the same conversation reported earlier this year in which Yates told McGahn that Flynn had misled the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and that he might be compromised, the person said.

However, Yates did not give McGahn the impression that the FBI was actively pursuing Flynn for lying, the source said. McGahn did not believe the FBI was investigating Flynn for lying because the bureau had not revoked his security clearance, the person said.

McGahn shared the information from Yates with the president, the person said.

A lawyer for McGahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yates did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Legal experts said if Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI and then pressured then-FBI director James Comey not to investigate him, that would be problematic.

If that were the case Trump’s tweet “absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge,” said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Notre Dame University. “It is evidence of the crucial question of whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent.”

In May, the president fired Comey, who later accused Trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the Russia allegations. Comey also said he believed Trump had asked him to drop the FBI’s probe into Flynn.

Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, said the tweet is open to interpretation and that Trump’s lawyer would downplay its significance.

White House attorney Ty Cobb referred questions about the president’s tweet to Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd, who described it as a “paraphrase” of a statement Cobb had made on Friday reacting to Flynn’s guilty plea.

According to a person familiar with the matter, Dowd composed the tweet.

The tweet is “bizarre and helpful to Mueller and hurtful to the president,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago now at the law firm Thompson Coburn. “It’s one more piece of evidence that helps show the president’s intent when he fired Comey.”

As part of his plea on Friday, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The retired U.S. Army lieutenant general admitted in a Washington court that he lied to FBI investigators about his discussions last December with Kislyak.

In what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, the pair discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia, and Flynn asked Kislyak to help delay a United Nations vote seen as damaging to Israel, according to prosecutors.

Flynn was also told by a “very senior member” of Trump’s transition team to contact Russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the U.N. vote, the prosecutors said.

Sources told Reuters the “very senior” transition official was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Separately, speaking at a defense conference in California on Saturday, Trump’s current national security advisor H.R. McMaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of Flynn, his immediate predecessor, was hurting U.S. national security.

“There’s tremendous confidence, I think there’s more confidence in the United States frankly. I think there’s a sense that we’re re-engaging in areas where we had largely disengaged,” he said.","Trump notes Flynn lied to FBI, says his actions during transition were lawful",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-flynn-plea/trump-notes-flynn-lied-to-fbi-says-his-actions-during-transition-were-lawful-idUKKBN1DW0HO

Xi’s comments were read by Huang Kunming, head of the Chinese Communist Party’s publicity department at the country’s largest public cyber policy forum in the town of Wuzhen in eastern China.

“The development of China’s cyberspace is entering a fast lane...China’s doors will only become more and more open,” said Xi in the note.

Cyber sovereignty is the idea that states should be permitted to manage and contain their own internet without external interference.

China’s Communist Party has tightened cyber regulation in the past year, formalizing new rules that require firms to store data locally and censor tools that allow users to subvert the Great Firewall.

In June, China introduced a new national cybersecurity law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures.

Cyber regulators say the laws are in line with international rules, and that they are designed to protect personal privacy and counter attacks on core infrastructure. Business groups say the rules unfairly target foreign firms.

China has advocated strongly for a larger role in global internet governance under Xi.

“China stands ready to develop new rules and systems of internet governance to serve all parties and counteract current imbalances,” said Wang Huning, a member of the Communist Party standing committee at the event on Sunday.

Some observers call the Russian president the Middle East’s New Sheriff and for good reason. Last week, during a series of meetings with the leaders of Syria, Turkey and Iran in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin took the central role in a major diplomatic push to end Syria’s civil war by winning support from Turkey and Iran to host a Syrian peace congress.

The Sochi summit conspicuously did not include delegates from the United States or the European Union. And while its focus was on the Middle East, it’s clear that Putin has expanded his influence beyond the region. In Europe, he destabilized Ukraine by annexing its Crimean peninsula and supporting separatists in the Donbass region after Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Moscow president in 2014. In Asia, he has developed an increasingly close relationship with China. In the United States, charges of Russian interference in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump have dominated Washington’s political landscape and overshadowed the administration’s legislative agenda.

This is an impressive turn of events for the leader of the economically-anemic remnant of a former superpower. Given that Russia’s economy has a GDP of $1.283 trillion – or barely 7 percent the size of America’s – Putin arguably has played a weak hand brilliantly.

But Putin’s apparent successes may turn out to be failures. The view of the Russian leader as a master tactician overlooks how his achievements risk blowing up in his face.

John Lloyd: What Merkel's political woes mean for the EU

Consider Ukraine: Russia has historically sought to dominate its southern neighbor and Putin remains loath to allow the country to leave Moscow's orbit and join the West. After Russia annexed Crimea, the Kremlin hoped to use a combination of Kremlin agents, local collaborators and irregular Russian soldiers to conquer the entire southern and eastern half of Ukraine. Since Ukraine's military had only 6,000 combat-ready troops Putin's dream of creating this ""Novorossiya"" — or New Russia — seemed within reach.

Unfortunately for Putin, things did not work out as he had planned. While Ukraine is culturally and linguistically split between a Ukrainian-speaking, Europe-oriented western half and a pro-Russian, Russian-speaking eastern area, Putin's war on their country crystallized a sense of national identity. Privately-funded military battalions and civilian volunteers helped the regular army beat back Russian-supported separatists and collaborators, and recent nationwide polls reveal a greater sense of Ukrainian identity than prior to 2014. Support for joining Western institutions like the EU and NATO has also jumped while anti-Russian sentiments have hardened.

Although the Kremlin may hope these trends eventually reverse and pro-Russian leaders like former President Viktor Yanukovych come to power again, that's probably wishful thinking. Moscow's annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine actually removed millions of Russia-friendly voters opposed to NATO and the EU from Ukraine's electorate, making it much more likely Kiev's leaders will eventually make good on their promise to bring Ukraine into the West. Putin may have gained Crimea, but he lost the rest of Ukraine.

Putin's interference in America's elections also hasn't worked out as planned. The Kremlin hoped Trump's election would result in more Russia-friendly policies, but the opposite has occurred. Putin's secret April proposal to completely reset the Russian-American relationship, and to cooperate on a whole series of global issues from Afghanistan to North Korea to cyber security, largely went nowhere. In August, Congress almost-unanimously passed new economic sanctions against Russia – including provisions directly targeting Putin’s oligarch allies – while also barring Trump from lifting previous sanctions without congressional review. Putin hoped Trump's election would weaken NATO, but the president has reaffirmed Washington's commitment to defend NATO allies. Trump has backed this up by continuing to deploy American forces to the Baltics while also sending additional troops to the Polish-Russian border. And, in part due to Trump’s consistent demands, Washington’s European allies are finally increasing their defense budgets.

While the Kremlin may still hold out hope Trump will eventually act on his continued desire to improve ties with Moscow, American domestic politics likely preclude this from happening. Some members of Trump’s own cabinet such as Defense Secretary James Mattis, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and national security adviser H.R. McMaster hold hawkish views on Russia and will probably push back against any attempt by Trump to improve the Russian-American relationship. More importantly, even if Trump wanted to normalize the relationship, the optics of doing so while Trump – and several of his closest relatives and advisors – remains under suspicion for colluding with Moscow’s attempts at electoral interference makes this politically implausible. Indeed, the investigation into Russian meddling provides incentive for Trump to appear tough on Russia to insulate him from accusations that he's a secret Russian puppet – something officials advocating supplying arms to Ukraine are taking advantage of.

Putin establishing closer ties with China also doesn’t represent the threat some Americans fear. The Chinese economy dwarfs Russia's and this economic imbalance likely relegates Russia to the role of junior partner in any possible alliance.

Moscow's military cooperation with China also represents less than meet the eye. Though joint military exercises have increased, these are unlikely to produce any kind of formal anti-Western alliance. Even worse for Putin, Moscow's new willingness to sell Beijing its most advanced arms may actually undermine Russia's long-term geopolitical position. Underlying mistrust between the two Eurasian powers dating back decades still exists, and if one day a revanchist China seeks to reclaim its historic Siberian territory Russia will regret Putin's decision to pursue short-term economic benefit at the expense of its national security.

To be clear, Putin can point to some genuine political accomplishments. Beyond his successful Syrian diplomacy, other key Middle Eastern countries have also been rushing to curry favor with him. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited Putin multiple times, asking him to respect Israel's interests in Syria. And in what many observers considered a historic development, King Salman bin Abdulaziz – accompanied by a 1,500 person delegation – became the first Saudi leader to visit Moscow. The two countries signed multiple agreements, including a remarkable deal for Riyadh to buy Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system.

Putin may have emerged as a Middle East power broker, but his gains elsewhere are tenuous.

The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State with Washington’s backing. The SDF offensive in Deir al-Zor province, which borders Iraq, has focused on territory east of the Euphrates river.

On the western bank, the Syrian military has waged its own attack against Islamic State with support from Iran-backed militias and Russia.

The separate assaults advanced from opposite sides of the river, which bisects oil-rich Deir al-Zor, mostly staying out of each other’s way. The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have held deconfliction meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict.

The SDF’s most powerful component, the YPG, announced that it had defeated Islamic State militants on its side “in cooperation with the Arab tribes.”

The U.S.-led coalition and Russian forces in Syria provided “air and logistical support, advice and coordination on the ground,” its statement said. “We hope for an increase in this support and for ensuring the necessary air cover.”

A YPG spokesman declared the victory in a village in Deir al-Zor in the presence of a Russian envoy from Moscow’s Hmeimim military base in Syria, it said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this week that as the battle against Islamic State entered its final stages, he expected the focus to move toward holding territory instead of arming Syrian Kurdish fighters.

Washington’s support for the YPG has infuriated Turkey, which sees the growing influence of Kurdish forces on its border as a security threat. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) movement, which has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.

Since the start of Syria’s conflict in 2011, the YPG and its allies have carved out autonomous regions in the north. They now control around a quarter of Syria, the largest part outside government control, after seizing vast land from Islamic State.

Their autonomy plans face opposition from their battlefield ally Washington, from Turkey and from the Syrian government.

The YPG said on Sunday it was forming civil councils for Deir al-Zor that include Kurds, Arabs and other components based on “the principle of democracy and self-rule.” It would mirror governing arrangements in other towns and cities that the Kurdish fighters and their allies captured.

With Islamic State close to collapse in Syria, Syrian Kurdish leaders hope for a phase of negotiations to shore up their autonomy in the north. But in recent months, the Damascus government and its Iranian allies have more forcefully asserted ambitions to take territory under the control of Kurdish-led forces.",Syrian Kurdish YPG says seized eastern region from Islamic State,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-ypg/syrian-kurdish-ypg-says-seized-eastern-region-from-islamic-state-idINKBN1DX0GO

“I am seeing signals, news that some businessmen are trying to move their assets abroad, and I call on firstly my cabinet from here to never allow this exit for any of them because these people are traitors,” Erdogan said.

Speaking to members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus, Erdogan did not say to whom he was referring, nor did he single out a single business, person or country of destination.

His comments come after the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Friday that Turkish prosecutors were set to seize the assets of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in the trial of a Turkish bank executive charged with evading U.S. sanctions on Iran, and his acquaintances.

The trial has caused already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington to deteriorate further as Zarrab detailed in court a scheme to evade the U.S. sanctions, saying that Erdogan personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when prime minister.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

“Two of America’s worst mass shootings (Las Vegas concert/ Texas church) have happened on your watch,” she might have tweeted back. “Shouldn’t POTUS focus on gun laws?” She didn’t do that, of course.

Probably. Education Secretary Justine Greening told the BBC that while she didn’t agree with Trump’s tweets she “did not believe it should detract from the close relationship the U.K. has had for many, many years and will go on to have with America and the American people.”

In the short term, however, the relationship will tremble. As will Theresa May, for she more than any other Western leader sought a demonstrative friendship with Trump, who held her hand in the White House rose garden. For May, a trade deal with the United States is a necessity after/if Brexit takes the U.K. out of the European Union’s single market.

There is a greater dependence than usual on the U.K. side of the relationship, one of which Trump – with his self-vaunted expertise in deal making – will be well aware. And the prime minister will have been aware that he is aware. Nonetheless, she still issued a public rebuke – a sign of her disgust, of her realization that the British establishment and most of its population would share her disgust and that she sees some things as too important to remain silent.

Yet if Britain is dependent – as all European states are on the U.S. military umbrella, among much else – so is America dependent on Britain. The “special relationship” is more treasured by British politicians than most American ones, but it still matters, especially when Washington seeks allies in controversial projects like the Iraq invasion. For Trump to prioritize the desire to hit back at a British prime minister over the threat of damage to that relationship is to reveal the terrible shallowness of the president’s grasp of international relationships, and to rouse yet again fears that his unpredictability and narcissism threatens us all.

If any good came of the latest fine mess the president has got the presidency into, it is that it has, for at least a day, brought the fractured and fractious British politics together behind Prime Minister May. Sadiq Khan, the Labour (and Muslim) mayor of London, himself a target of Trump’s earlier tweets, said that the president’s comments were “a betrayal of the special relationship.” The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, showed a tender care for Queen Elizabeth not usual for one on the left of the Labour Party, lamenting that Trump had put the monarch into a “difficult and invidious position” since the invitation for a state visit, which still stands, is officially issued under the Queen’s name.

Is it possible that Trump’s straight-from-the-shoulder style is simply unbearable to the British, perceived by many Americans (and others) as being snobbish and repressed? Certainly, some of Trump’s right-wing supporters appreciate his bluntness about Islamic extremists. “That’s not news,” Mark Krikorian, a supporter of the president and executive director of the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies told the New York Times of Trump’s Twitter sharing. Trump “just expresses that stuff in the most unfiltered, guy-ranting-in-the-bar” way.

It isn’t that. Trump’s “style,” in this context, is directly and repeatedly anti-Muslim. He has sought and still seeks to stop Muslims coming to the United States. He said, falsely, that thousands of people in New Jersey – “a heavy Arab population” – had been shown on TV cheering after the planes destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 9/11. The unverified videos he re-tweeted this week came from the Britain First group, not just far-right but dedicated to stirring up violent action against Muslims; its deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, herself faces several charges of harassment of Muslims.

Compare Trump’s response with his recent predecessors. George W. Bush had to bear the shock of the 2001 attacks as a newish president, but took some care in his reaction to the horror to tell Muslims that he respected the “good and peaceful” teachings of Islam and that America’s enemy was “a radical network of terrorists,” not “our many Muslim friends.” Barack Obama continued that tradition.

In the U.K., as in other Western democracies, that distinction – between the large majority of peaceful citizens of Muslim faith and the few deadly, militant Islamists among their number – is maintained. How else could a civil society be retained if thousands, in some countries millions, of citizens and would-be citizens were demonized and made the butt of violent prejudice?

Trump’s behavior this week shows how little he understands this. Washington and Westminster may continue their close alliance, but the president should not see his decision to give publicity to a semi-fascist group’s efforts to sow violent hatred – then capping that with the need to humiliate a close ally – as a good day’s work.",Commentary: Will Trump’s anti-Muslim retweets destroy U.S.-U.K. special relationship?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-retweets-commentary/commentary-will-trumps-anti-muslim-retweets-destroy-u-s-u-k-special-relationship-idUSKBN1DV5U5

The economy added 79,500 jobs in November, Statistics Canada said on Friday, blowing past expectations and sending the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, its lowest since February 2008 even as labor market participation was unchanged.

“This was another barn-burner of a jobs report,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

“For the Bank of Canada, this certainly means the economy is doing quite well and pumping out a lot of jobs,” which could make the central bank’s statement after its meeting next week more upbeat, Guatieri said.

The data drove the Canadian dollar to its biggest gain in nearly three months against the greenback. The stock market was steady.

It also bolstered minority bets of a third increase next week to 27.6 percent from 20.2 percent ahead of the release.

“It certainly firms the idea that there are more near-term hikes than previously anticipated,” said Michael Dolega, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.

For more commentary:

Average hourly wages continued to accelerate, up an annual 2.7 percent in the best performance since April 2016. The Bank of Canada has pointed to wages as one factor it is looking at to decide future policy.

The Canadian labor market has been on a tear for over a year and has added 390,000 jobs since last November, driven by full-time employment. Last month’s gains were fueled by hiring in the manufacturing and trade sectors.

The jobs figures garnered more attention than the separate gross domestic product report, which showed the economy grew at an annualized 1.7 percent in the third quarter.

The economy had been expected to slow after growth in the first half of the year made Canada a Group of Seven leader.

Exports were the main drag as shipments of vehicles and parts fell. The housing sector also weighed on growth, partly reflecting slower resale activity.

September growth was better-than-forecast, rising 0.2 percent and pointing to momentum heading into the fourth quarter, which is expected to be stronger.

Separate data from Markit showed the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector was little changed in November as firmer new orders and employment were offset by slower production.","Canada's economy cools in third quarter, November job surge keeps rate hikes in sight",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1DV4Y4-OCADN

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said. But they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when.

Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump aides.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump said on Twitter while he was in New York for a fundraising trip. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Flynn, who on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who was Trump’s national security adviser only for 24 days. He was forced to resign after he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak.

“What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for the New York trip. “There’s been absolutely no collusion, so we’re very happy.”

Establishing when Trump was told Flynn lied to the FBI agents could be key to determining if the president acted improperly.

According to a person familiar with the matter, during a conversation between White House counsel Don McGahn and then-acting attorney general Sally Yates in January, Yates told McGahn that Flynn had told FBI agents the same thing he had told Pence.

This was the same conversation reported earlier this year in which Yates told McGahn that Flynn had misled the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and that he might be compromised, the person said.

However, Yates did not give McGahn the impression that the FBI was actively pursuing Flynn for lying, the source said. McGahn did not believe the FBI was investigating Flynn for lying because the bureau had not revoked his security clearance, the person said.

McGahn shared the information from Yates with the president, the person said.

A lawyer for McGahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yates did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Legal experts said if Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI and then pressured then-FBI director James Comey not to investigate him, that would be problematic.

If that were the case Trump’s tweet “absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge,” said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Notre Dame University. “It is evidence of the crucial question of whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent.”

In May, the president fired Comey, who later accused Trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the Russia allegations. Comey also said he believed Trump had asked him to drop the FBI’s probe into Flynn.

Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, said the tweet is open to interpretation and that Trump’s lawyer would downplay its significance.

White House attorney Ty Cobb referred questions about the president’s tweet to Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd, who described it as a “paraphrase” of a statement Cobb had made on Friday reacting to Flynn’s guilty plea.

Slideshow (8 Images)

According to a person familiar with the matter, Dowd composed the tweet.

The tweet is “bizarre and helpful to Mueller and hurtful to the president,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago now at the law firm Thompson Coburn. “It’s one more piece of evidence that helps show the president’s intent when he fired Comey.”

As part of his plea on Friday, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The retired U.S. Army lieutenant general admitted in a Washington court that he lied to FBI investigators about his discussions last December with Kislyak.

In what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, the pair discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia, and Flynn asked Kislyak to help delay a United Nations vote seen as damaging to Israel, according to prosecutors.

Flynn was also told by a “very senior member” of Trump’s transition team to contact Russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the U.N. vote, the prosecutors said.

Sources told Reuters the “very senior” transition official was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Separately, speaking at a defense conference in California on Saturday, Trump’s current national security advisor H.R. McMaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of Flynn, his immediate predecessor, was hurting U.S. national security.

“There’s tremendous confidence, I think there’s more confidence in the United States frankly. I think there’s a sense that we’re re-engaging in areas where we had largely disengaged,” he said.","Trump notes Flynn lied to FBI, says his actions during transition were lawful",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DW0HO

The umbrella organization for the world’s central banks gave the warning as investors continue to bask in what it called the “light and warmth” of improving global growth, subdued inflation and soaring stock markets.

Record high debt levels, however, highlight vulnerabilities in the financial system and the scale of this year’s rally in asset prices seems to have increased caution at the Switzerland-based BIS.

“High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy (asset price) valuations,” the head of BIS’s monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said.

“The longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence.”

There was some surprise too that benchmark bond yields - which drive global borrowing costs - have stayed down even with the Federal Reserve now shrinking its balance sheet and the European Central Bank also about to heavily cut its stimulus.

The improving global growth outlook, Japan’s ongoing money printing and the message from both the Fed and ECB that they will tread carefully going forward was the likely explanation for still low yields, though they did raise a “deeper question”.

“Can a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions unambiguously ease? And, if the answer is no, what should central banks do?” Borio said.

The pace of tightening from the likes of the Fed is already expected to be the slowest on record.

One concern is that the continued low bond yields and low market volatility, particularly in the United States, are reminiscent of the bond market “conundrum” referred to by former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in 2005 before the financial crisis.

Yields remained low then too despite a run of U.S. rate hikes and only gained any traction later in the cycle.

“In an era in which gradualism and predictability are becoming the norm, these questions (about effective tightening) are likely to grow more pressing.”

It is especially the case with some stock market gauges now in “frothy” territory.

At recent levels in excess of 30, the U.S. stock market’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), for example, has exceeded its post-1982 average by almost 25 percent.

The dividend payout ratio of U.S. companies is also back at highs observed in the 1970s and so might not go much further. “High valuations: market complacency?” the BIS posed the question, though it said stocks did look much less frothy when measured against extremely low bonds yields.

After two strong rounds put the former world number one in contention for his first win since 2013, Woods recorded four of his five bogeys in the first seven holes to slip to 10th at four-under 212, 10 strokes behind leader Charley Hoffman.

Woods, in his first tournament in nearly 10 months following spinal fusion surgery, said he had some bad breaks on Saturday and that his game was better than his scorecard suggested.

“Anything I did right ended up in a bad spot, then everything I did wrong, it was really bad,” Woods told NBC television.

”I’ve got to keep fighting and that is one thing I have always done in my entire career. That’s keep fighting and try and post the best number I possibly could.

“I really didn’t feel I was that far off. That’s the crazy part ... I just ended up in bad spots after good shots.”

Only in the closing five holes, where Woods twice had birdies and narrowly missed a third at the last, did the 41-year-old show he could again be a factor at the elite 18-man event that features eight of the world’s top 10.

”It feels good to be out here fighting again,“ he said. ”I’ve missed the fight and getting out there and competing, fighting against the golf course and the guys.

“It’s so much fun.”

Breezy conditions made sub-par rounds difficult at the Albany course with overnight leader Hoffman one of the few to deliver, surging to a five-stroke lead after a birdie at 18 for a two-under 70 and a 202 total.

Jordan Spieth (72) and England’s Justin Rose (71) were tied for second at nine-under 207, one stroke ahead of Italy’s Francesco Molinari (71).

The troubles for Woods started early on Saturday as he took bogeys at the first and third holes before further miscues at six and seven saw him post a four-over 40 for the front nine.

That contrasted sharply with Friday when he took nine shots less to finish the front nine.

“The shot that really threw me for a loop was the shot at three,” Woods said. “I hit the most beautiful three wood that went 300 yards in the wind.”

But he wound up with a bogey.

Woods finally picked up a shot at the 14th, doffing his hat to the crowd in relief, before carding another birdie at the par-three 17th.

“It’s ridiculous,” he said. “It took me 14 holes to make a birdie. At that time I had already played four par-fives and nothing happened.”",Woods struggles as bogeys slow his comeback,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1DW0QV-OCASP

It is one of six apartments that she cleans every day. She mops floors, scrubs bathroom tiles, takes out the garbage and sweeps and wipes the apartment stairs.

People are silhouetted against the setting sun at a park in New Delhi March 10, 2010. REUTERS/B Mathur/Files

She likes to talk to herself while she works. Her employers joke about it, but it’s one way to get through the tedium that comes with spending the work day with her back bent over or on her haunches.

She meets her boyfriend on Saturdays. That’s her day off, she said as she mopped my apartment stairs. Where do they go? I asked her. What do they do?

“We generally go to a place which is far from my home. I borrow my employer’s cellphone to call him and decide our plans,” she said.

She’s the first woman from her family who makes her own money. They’re from Bihar, hundreds of miles to the east, and they’re conservative. In the capital, she prefers wearing jeans and short-sleeved kurtas like the “Delhi girls,” who they see at bus stops and on the metro trains; the ones who go to college and work in offices and set the fashion trends for a growing population of people from the countryside who are looking for work in India’s big cities.

Unlike those girls and so many other, richer people in Delhi, she and her boyfriend don’t have an option to go out for a date to places that most people who would read this story would go. The 23-year-old earns 8,000 rupees a month ($125) for her work. That’s what her employers can expect to pay for a single “date night” out at one of the city’s finer restaurants.

Delhi has a per capita annual income of 300,000 rupees ($4,615) - the highest in the country and three times the national average. But nearly half of the city’s population lives in slums without basic services and facilities like drinking water, garbage disposal or a proper drainage system.

These aren’t the people you will meet out at what online restaurant listing service Zomato calls a typical “romantic dinner” for a couple in Delhi, where the cost for two usually starts at 3,000 rupees ($47) and goes as high as 10,000 ($155), depending on where you go. A movie date with snacks can cost somewhere around 2,500 rupees to an upper-middle class couple.

For poor people, going on a date requires setting different expectations. Money, where to go and what to do, coupled with a lack of privacy in a densely populated place make for rendezvous that are no less romantic, but decidedly different from what many young people around the world consider a “date.”

Anuradha usually takes a bus to go to Kalindi Kunj Park or the ruins of the Tughlaqabad fort, both around four kilometres from her home, and that’s where she meets her boyfriend for dates. She lives in one-room flat in the Jhuggi Jhopri colony – a settlement developed by the city government near the easternmost edge of Delhi for poor people as an alternative to illegal slums.

“I don’t really want any expensive gifts, or to go to big restaurants. These things are superficial,” said Anuradha, who said she likes watching romance movies and is a big Shah Rukh Khan fan.

When she and her boyfriend meet, they talk about their lives and walk around the park, or eat aloo-chaat or golgappas at a roadside stall. Mostly, the boyfriend, who works as a helper at a general-provision store, pays the bill.

Then there is the story of Surender and Preeti.

“We used to gift each other colorful dhaga (sacred threads) or lockets bought from roadside vendors, meet each other on terraces in our colony and convey our messages through our younger cousins or mutual friends,” Surender said. “We used to meet in desolate lanes and ask the younger ones to be on a lookout. That was what we termed as a date. It was years before I took her to have a burger at a McDonalds’ outlet in Connaught Place. It cost me 60 rupees.”

Surender used to ask Preeti to meet him at a meeting point far from their homes. Dressed up in his best clothes, some cheap jeans and a shirt from counterfeit brands bought from Palika Bazaar, and wearing cologne, his priority was to plan their dates in a way to avoid Delhi’s infamous “eve-teasers,” men who sexually harass women on the street with leers, catcalls and often ironic serenades of lyrics from famous Bollywood film songs.

“I first saw her in a jagrata (all-night prayer ritual) in my colony and knew she was made for me. Though we used to stare at each other daily, I had to wait for another nine years before I could gather the courage to talk to her. I thought she was too beautiful to be with someone like me.”

Surender, now 30, won her heart through his romantic poetry.

Twelve years after they started dating, they married. The family disapproved. Surender’s grandmother and Preeti’s mother were from the same “gotra,” or clan. Hindu clans prohibit marriage within the descendants of an unbroken male line. (Marrying within the “gotra” is one of the primary reasons for recurring “honour killing” of lovers in India.)

The couple used to meet each other however they could — by bus, auto rickshaw and on foot. “I had a slightly well-off friend from whom I used to borrow clothes, money and often his bike. We never went to malls as everything there was out of my budget. I was also afraid that they would throw us out because we couldn’t speak English.”

The biggest problem for such couples is a space to meet. Between gossiping neighbours and disapproving family members, not to mention the ubiquitous “aunties,” (middle-aged women) dating can require one immediate commitment: taking the time to go somewhere far from where you live. Often, the destinations are Delhi’s parks.

Buddha Jayanti Park, Lodhi Gardens, Deer Park, Millennium Indraprastha Park, the Garden of Five Senses and Kalindi Kunj Park are some of the most popular “lovers’ parks”.

Tucked in the corners or behind the bushes are couples from different parts of the city; kissing or cozying up to each other under a shawl or a bedsheet. In the background in some parks are old Muslim tombs and gumbads (domes), trees and flower gardens, some stray dogs, children at play, old people taking their daily walks alongside tourists, and picnicking families. Everyone learns to take a peek and look away when they see a boy and girl à deux.

But even poor lovers face a tough crowd.

“Looks like all the dirt of the city assembles here only,” says a man sitting with his wife and three children under a tree in the Kalindi Kunj Park against the backdrop of the Delhi Eye, a 200-foot-tall ferris wheel.

Arun believes it’s the man’s persistence to woo them that matters to most women. “People from my strata don’t have the option to trust anyone quickly. How much a person can wait is ultimately the sign of their interest. We don’t swipe each other on apps,” he says while pointing to a cheap smartphone in his hand.

Even though China-made affordable smartphones are making inroads among India’s poor people, dating apps such as Tinder remain the province of wealthier people because of the social stigma associated with dating and premarital sex.

“High-profile people like you can go to restaurants or hotels. We have just parks”, says Arun, an 18-year-old commerce student. “Even places like McDonald’s are an option for the ones who have some cash. Most of my friends just take their girls to parks and treat them with jhalmuri (puffed rice mixed with spices). The girls also don’t have that many expectations.”

Arun sometimes gives his girlfriend a ring bought from the roadside or a simple greeting card, which cost around 10 to 20 rupees.

He also takes his girlfriend to parks and to the movies, but only on Thursdays when the ticket prices are cheapest as the demand for them generally dwindles on last day before the next film releases on Friday. The matinee shows on these “slow” days cost 100 to 150 rupees, and are usually cheaper than the evening shows on weekends – reaching up to eight times than what Arun pays. They refrain from buying overpriced snacks at the concession stands.

“A few people I know have collected money to give their girlfriends a mobile phone to talk to them. If the girl’s family gets to know about the secret phone, she gets beaten up by her parents,” he said. “The braver ones run away from home with their lovers. Every once in a while, these stories end up in suicides.”",Dating in Delhi when you're poor,https://in.reuters.com/article/delhi-dating/dating-in-delhi-when-youre-poor-idINKBN1DU0NE

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

Italy’s communications regulator AGCOM will decide by the middle of next year how to address competition concerns regarding TIM’s network, an AGCOM official said on Nov. 15.

There are three options open to the watchdog, the official said, including moving toward imposing a clearer functional separation of the network.",TIM's board to discuss network options this week: source,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecomitalia-network/tims-board-to-discuss-network-options-this-week-source-idUKKBN1DX0LS

The New York Times and the Washington Post identified the investigator as FBI agent Peter Strzok, the deputy head of FBI counter-intelligence. He was reassigned last summer to the FBI’s human resources department after the Justice Department’s inspector general began looking into the text messages, the papers said, quoting several unidentified people familiar with the matter.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed the reports Strzok was transferred to the human resources department over the politically charged text messages.

Strzok played a key role in the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the papers said.

During that probe and the 2016 presidential election, Strzok and an FBI colleague exchanged texts that disparaged then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and favored Clinton, his Democratic rival, the Washington Post said. The newspapers did not disclose details of the text messages.

Reuters was unable to reach Strzok for comment. The New York Times said that a lawyer for Strzok declined to comment, while the Washington Post said it repeatedly sought comment from Strzok, but received no response.

Mueller’s office confirmed Strzok’s removal, but did not elaborate on the cause.

“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel’s Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” spokesman Peter Carr said.

In apparent reference to the case, the Justice Department inspector general’s office said in a statement on Saturday that it was “reviewing allegations involving communications between certain individuals.”

The matter came up during a review that the Justice Department launched into the FBI’s decision to announce an inquiry into Clinton’s emails shortly before the November presidential election.

The statement provided no further details and it did not mention any individuals by name. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for further comment.

The FBI was not immediately available for comment.

According to the newspapers, federal law enforcement officials became concerned that Trump and his supporters could use the exposure of the text messages to attack the credibility of Mueller’s investigation.

Mueller, a former FBI director, is looking into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which ran an influence operation aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over Clinton, according to three U.S. intelligence agencies.

Trump has criticized the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, initially citing it as his reason for firing former FBI director James Comey on May 9. Some lawmakers have called for Mueller to resign.",Mueller removed FBI agent from Russia probe for anti-Trump texts: reports,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-fbi/mueller-removed-fbi-agent-from-russia-probe-for-anti-trump-texts-reports-idUSKBN1DW0Q0

No entanto, funcionários e diplomatas da UE alertaram no domingo que ainda não estava claro se seria alcançado um acordo com a primeira-ministra britânica em seu encontro com o Executivo da UE.

Duas horas antes de se sentarem para almoçar com May em Bruxelas, o presidente da Comissão, Jean-Claude Juncker, e seu negociador para o Brexit, Michel Barnier, se reunirão com Guy Verhofstadt e sua equipe do Brexit no Parlamento Europeu, disse uma autoridade.

Verhofstadt e seus colegas escreveram aos negociadores da UE na semana passada para alertar para o que disseram ser negociações “estagnadas” sobre as exigências da UE de que os direitos dos cidadãos da UE no Reino Unido sejam garantidos diretamente pelo Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia após o Reino Unido deixar o bloco. Eles também expressaram preocupação com a Irlanda do Norte.

O Parlamento europeu deve ratificar qualquer tratado sobre a saída do Reino Unido da União Européia antes do Brexit, em março de 2019, para criar o período de transição suave que May deseja, e desta forma será vital para ambos os lados manter os parlamentares a bordo

Autoridades da UE e diplomatas disseram que o trabalho continuava neste domingo. Uma pessoa próxima às discussões disse que a situação era “delicada”. Verhofstadt, ex-primeiro-ministro belga e forte crítico do Brexit, não quis comentar.

“Ainda é bastante fluido”, disse uma segunda pessoa envolvida. “Nada existe nenhum acordo até que tudo esteja de acordo”.

A UE quer acordos gerais sobre três termos críticos da saída antes de abrir negociações sobre a transição e um futuro pacto comercial que aconteceria posteriormente. O almoço de May na segunda-feira é o prazo para a UE ter as ofertas finais da primeira-ministra antes que os líderes da UE considerem se concordarão em uma cúpula de 15 de dezembro para lançar a fase dois.

O Reino Unido e a UE pretendem assinar uma declaração conjunta que estabelece progresso em direção a acordos finais que a Comissão, como Executivo da UE, considerarão “suficientes” para a abertura de negociações comerciais.

As autoridades da UE dizem que já foram combinados os termos para um acordo financeiro que os adeptos do Brexit linha dura resistem há muito tempo. O primeiro-ministro irlandês disse no sábado que abrangeria essencialmente todos os 60 bilhões de euros exigidos pela UE.

Em relação à segunda questão fundamental para um acordo para evitar uma “fronteira dura” terrestre entre o Reino Unido e a UE em toda a ilha da Irlanda, os diplomatas afirmam que o documento conjunto estabelecerá regras para alcançar um acordo de fronteira destinado a evitar a ruptura da paz no norte, mas deixando muitos detalhes em aberto.

A terceira questão, dos direitos dos cidadãos, por muito tempo pareceu ser a menos problemática, mas as preocupações do Parlamento Europeu na semana passada foram uma lembrança de quão longe a insistência no Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia em ter a palavra final em Londres respeitava os conflitos sobre os tratados de retirada com as demandas britânicas para ser livre de tribunais da UE.

Não ficou imediatamente claro se foi atingido um meio-termo.

Darauf hätten sich Kanzleramtschef Peter Altmaier und Vizekanzler Sigmar Gabriel verständigt, berichteten die “Stuttgarter Zeitung” und die “Stuttgarter Nachrichten” am Wochenende. Ein Sprecher des Finanzministeriums sagte: “Das ist völlig offen. Es gibt noch keine Festlegung.” Der Sozialist Centeno hatte geholfen, sein Land aus der Schuldenkrise zu führen, und ist seit 2015 Finanzminister. Er hat seither zwar einige Sparmaßnahmen zurückgenommen, pocht zugleich aber auf Einhaltung der EU-Vorgaben. Die Wirtschaft des Landes wuchs in diesem Jahr so stark wie seit zehn Jahren nicht mehr.

Die Amtszeit des jetzigen Eurogruppen-Chefs, des früheren niederländischen Finanzministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem, endet am 13. Januar. Er muss den Posten räumen, weil seine Partei nicht mehr der neuen Regierung in Den Haag angehört und der Vorsitz der Eurogruppe traditionell von einem amtierenden Finanzminister ausgeübt wird. Die Ressortchefs der Eurogruppe wollen bei ihrem Treffen am Montag in Brüssel über Dijsselbloems Nachfolge entscheiden. Der Eurogruppen-Chef organisiert die monatlichen Beratungen der 19 Finanzminister und lotet Kompromisse in Streitfragen aus. Der Posten wird von dem Gremium mit einfacher Mehrheit für zweieinhalb Jahre vergeben. Für ein positives Votum sind 10 der 19 Stimmen nötig.

Weitere Kandidaten für den Vorsitz sind EU-Vertretern zufolge auch Centenos slowakischer Kollege Peter Kazimir und die lettische Ressortchefin Dana Reizniece-Ozola. Centenos und Kazimirs Chancen werden erhöht, weil sie zur sozialdemokratischen Parteienfamilie in Europa gehören. Die Präsidenten von EU-Kommission, EU-Rat und EU-Parlament stammen dagegen alle aus der konservativen Europäischen Volkspartei. Gewöhnlich werden die Spitzenposten in Brüssel im Einklang mit den Machtverhältnissen in Europa verteilt.

Die Finanzminister wollen sich am Montag auch mit der Lage Griechenlands befassen.

Die Vereinbarung umfasst zahlreiche Punkte, etwa Finanzfragen, Reformen am Arbeitsmarkt und im Energiebereich, den Umgang mit faulen Krediten und Privatisierungen. Sollten die Geldgeber die Vereinbarung billigen, könnten weitere fünf Milliarden Euro an Krediten aus dem insgesamt bis zu 86 Milliarden Euro umfassenden dritten Hilfsprogramm fließen.

Soccer Football - Serie A - Benevento Calcio vs AC Milan - Stadio Ciro Vigorito, Benevento, Italy - December 3, 2017 Benevento’s Alberto Brignoli celebrates with teammates after scoring their second goal REUTERS/Ciro De Luca

With Benevento having lost their first 14 top flight matches, the result was another deep embarrassment to big-spending AC Milan who were playing their first match under new coach Gennaro Gattuso, their fiery former midfielder, after sacking Vincenzo Montella on Monday.

In a later game, Ivan Perisic scored a hat-trick to lead unbeaten Inter Milan to a 5-0 win over Chievo which took them top of the table, overhauling Napoli who lost 1-0 at home to Juventus on Friday.

AC Milan, who spent over 200 million euros ($237.78 million) in the summer transfer market compared to Benevento’s total of 20 million, twice led but were pegged back after Alessio Romagnoli was sent off for a second booking in the 75th minute.

Brignoli went up to join the attack after his side won a free kick in the fifth minute of stoppage time and, as Danilo Cataldi whipped the ball in, he met it with a flying header into the bottom corner of the net to spark wild scenes at the modest Stadio Ciro Vigorito.

The 26-year-old became the first goalkeeper to score in Serie A since Massimo Taibi for Reggina in 2001.

“There was nothing to lose. I just closed my eyes and jumped. It was a goalkeeper’s goal, not a forward’s goal,” he said.

A bemused Gattuso said: “It hurts. A knife wound would have been less painful than that goal. I would never have expected to concede a goal in the last minute with the opposition goalkeeper scoring.”

Serie A debutants Benevento should have gone ahead just after the half hour but Vittorio Parigini sent a free header wide from Marco D‘Alessandro’s cross.

Instead, they found themselves a goal behind when Giacomo Bonaventura headed in at the far post after Benevento missed several chances to clear the danger.

George Puscas snapped up a rebound to give Benevento an equaliser five minutes after halftime but, as so often this season, they undid the good work by quickly conceding another, Nikola Kalinic scoring after being allowed a free header.

Milan, however, handed the initiative to Benevento as the pressure grew after Romagnoli was harshly sent off for a tackle on Gaetano Letizia, even though no contact seemed to be made.

The hosts attacked desperately but were finally rewarded with Brignoli’s stunning effort on a memorable afternoon.

Inter survived an early scare, when goalkeeper Samir Handanovic parried Riccardo Meggiorini’s header from close range, before running riot at the San Siro.

A Perisic volley and Mauro Icardi’s 16th league goal of the season put them in control at halftime while Milan Skriniar was on target in the second half with Perisic scoring the other two.

Inter lead with 39 points from 15 games, followed by Napoli on 38, Juventus on 37 and AS Roma on 34 with a game in hand.

Fiorentina drew level on 21 points with Milan in seventh place thanks to a 3-0 win over lowly Sassuolo.

O papa fez seus comentários aos repórteres a bordo do avião na volta a Roma de uma viagem para Mianmar e Bangladesh, dominada pela crise dos refugiados rohingya que afeta ambos países.

Em um discurso no mês passado, o papa sugeriu estar preparado para endurecer oficialmente a Igreja de décadas de ensino que possuir armas nucleares como dissuasão era moralmente aceitável, desde que o objetivo final seja sua eliminação.

Nesse discurso em 10 de novembro, Francisco disse que mesmo a mera posse de armas nucleares agora deve ser condenada porque parece haver pouca ou nenhuma intenção dos líderes mundiais em reduzi-las.

A bordo do avião, o papa foi questionado sobre o que o motivava a mudar a posição oficial da Igreja e, especificamente, o que ele sentiu sobre a guerra de palavras entre o presidente dos Estados Unidos Donald Trump e o líder norte-coreano Kim Jong Un.

“O que mudou foi a irracionalidade (da atitude no que diz respeito a armas nucleares)”, disse Francisco.

“Hoje estamos no limite”, disse ele. “Pode ser debatido, mas é minha opinião e convicção de que alcançamos o limite (moral) da licença de ter e usar armas nucleares”, disse.

“Por quê? Porque hoje, com uma tecnologia tão sofisticada, arriscamos a destruição da humanidade ou de pelo menos uma grande parte dela”, disse ele.

No passado, o papa sugeriu que uma terceira nação deveria tentar negociar um acordo entre os Estados Unidos e a Coreia do Norte e pediu que ambos os lados resfriassem a retórica, interrompendo os insultos.

A Coreia do Sul disse na sexta-feira que o último teste com míssil feito pela Coreia do Norte colocaria Washington no alcance, mas Pyongyang ainda precisa provar que dominou a tecnologia de mísseis críticos, como a reentrada, orientação do estágio terminal e ativação da ogiva.

The poll, published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, found 50 percent of people supported another vote on the final terms of Britain’s exit deal, 34 percent rejected another referendum and 16 percent said they did not know.

The newspaper said it was the first major opinion poll since last week’s media reports that Britain is preparing to pay about 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to help to pave the way for talks on a future trade pact with the EU.

The online poll, carried out by research firm Survation, interviewed 1,003 adults in Britain between 30 November and 1 December.

Mike Smithson, an election analyst who runs the www.politicalbetting.com website and a former Liberal Democrat politician, said on Twitter it was “the first time any pollster has recorded backing” for a second Brexit referendum.

Since the referendum in 2016, high profile opponents of Britain’s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron, to former British prime minister Tony Blair and billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous for the British economy.

Blair told the BBC on Sunday that Britain could change its mind about leaving the EU.

“It’s reversible. It’s not done until it’s done,” he said.

Blair said what the government was seeking to negotiate was not possible.

“They are trying to negotiate getting out of the single market while recreating all of its benefits,” Blair said. “That’s not going to happen.”

As autoridades locais da Igreja Católica Romana aconselharam o papa a não pronunciar a palavra, pois poderia desencadear uma reação contra os cristãos e outros grupos minoritários.

O papa se reuniu com os líderes militares de Mianmar em particular na segunda-feira, pouco depois de sua chegada à maior cidade do país, Yangon.

A reunião estava programada para a manhã de quinta-feira, mas os militares sugeriram, no último minuto, que fosse adiada. O resultado foi que eles viram o papa antes dos líderes civis, em vez do contrário, como foi planejado.

“Foi uma boa conversa e a verdade não foi negociável”, disse ele sobre o encontro com os líderes militares.

O último êxodo de Mianmar para Bangladesh, de cerca de 625.000 pessoas, ocorreu devido a uma repressão militar de Mianmar em resposta a ataques de militantes rohingya contra uma base do Exército e postos de polícia em 25 de agosto.

De acordo com os refugiados, diversas aldeias rohingya foram incendiadas, pessoas foram mortas e mulheres estupradas.

Corbyn’s criticisms of Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman’s pay and “speculators” in general seem a little out of date. Regulators across Europe have limited bonuses since the financial crisis, and banks have cut remuneration. Average bank CEO pay has fallen, in real terms, by 49 percent since 2006 according to analysts at New Financial. The think-tank reckons that pay as a proportion of revenues at investment banks declined by 9 percentage points to 37 percent over the decade to 2016.

Still, bankers are an easy target for Corbyn. The fact that CEO salary is still on average $11.4 million a year underlines their stratospheric levels of remuneration before the crisis. True, that’s not out of whack with other firms, as Ermotti pointed out with a jibe at “big tech” companies. But neither Google nor Amazon took state capital; nor do they benefit from an implicit government guarantee which keeps their funding costs low.

Shareholders have also suffered. Over the past decade European banks’ total shareholder returns, including reinvested dividends, have averaged minus 39 percent compared with a positive 48 percent for the STOXX Europe 600 index. Leave out the crisis years of 2008 and 2009, and banks still only returned 10 percent, barely a 10th of the broader index.

Bankers might dismiss Corbyn’s broadside as hyperbole. There is nothing in Labour’s recent manifesto which explicitly targets banks. That would be naive. The risk is that the UK Conservative government now feels that it has to match Corbyn’s invective. And there’s plenty a Labour government could do to attack banks, such as imposing transaction taxes or nationalisation. That would hit Britain hard, if it meant bankers left for more business-friendly countries, but shareholders would be wise to act first.",Breakingviews - Jeremy Corbyn pay row shows costs of bank excess,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-jeremy-corbyn-pay-row-shows-costs-of-bank-excess-idUKKBN1DV5CN

The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging America’s friends back into confusion over President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.

The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washington’s leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria.

“Just as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,” said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials.

“It leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump.”

U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue.

European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union.

In addition, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities.

“The chaos in the administration doesn’t help in the current geopolitical climate,” said a senior French diplomat.

Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy.

“The United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad,” he told a think tank.

He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday.

The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.

“If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy – those expectations have been disappointed,” said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats in parliament.

“On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.”

Despite Tillerson’s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.

The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence.

Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis.

Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump’s foreign policy, diplomats said.

“LARGER DOSE OF TRUMP”

There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump.

“We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,” if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.

One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, “so it never left Tillerson much room.”

In addition, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace.

But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later.

Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say.

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

Shafik, a former air force chief and government minister, has been seen by critics of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as a potential challenger to the former military commander who is widely expected to run for a second term next year.

Details about what happened to Shafik are unclear. He made his surprise announcement on Wednesday about running in the 2018 election from UAE where he has been based with his family.

Shafik’s family said he was taken from their home on Saturday by UAE authorities and flown by private plane back to Cairo. A Reuters witness said Egyptian authorities escorted him in a convoy from the airport.

“We know nothing about him since he left home yesterday,” Shafik’s daughter May told Reuters. “If he was deported he should have been able to go home by now, not just disappear. We consider him kidnapped.”

The family and lawyer said they planned to file complaints with the prosecutor’s office around Shafik’s whereabouts. UAE authorities confirmed he left the Emirates but gave no details.

A source at the interior ministry said: “We do not know anything about Shafik. We did not arrest him and we did not receive any requests from the prosecution to arrest him or bring him back.”

GULF ALLIES

Shafik’s abrupt departure from UAE came weeks after Lebanese officials accused Saudi Arabia of meddling by forcing Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to resign by holding him against his will.

Saudi Arabia denied those charges but the case prompted a crisis and pushed Lebanon back into the center of a regional struggle between Riyadh with its Sunni Gulf allies and Iran.

Sisi is an ally of UAE and Saudi Arabia and his supporters say he is key to Egypt’s stability. Critics say he has eroded freedoms gained after a 2011 uprising that ousted former leader Hosni Mubarak and jailed hundreds of dissidents.

Sisi has won backing from Gulf states and has presented himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants since, as army commander, he led the overthrow in 2013 of former president Mohamed Mursi of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood.

Shafik, who narrowly lost a 2012 bid against Mursi, has joined several lower-profile candidates who say they will run, though some believe they have no chance against Sisi.

FILE PHOTO: Flyers of Egyptian presidential candidate and former prime minister Ahmed Shafiq are seen on the ground outside his campaign headquarters in Cairo, Egypt May 28, 2012. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo

After four decades in the military, Shafik touted his military experience as one of his strengths in the 2012 vote.

But he fled to the UAE to escape corruption charges in June 2012. He dismissed the charges as politically motivated and was taken off airport watchlists last year.

In UAE, his family said he had round-the-clock security at home and informed authorities about his whereabouts. Soon after his announcement on Wednesday, he claimed he had been blocked. Though his family later said he had been given assurances he could travel.

“Apparently Shafik had to tell the Emiratis about all his moves since he came in 2012 but this time he didn’t for unknown reasons. Maybe he thought they wouldn’t let him leave,” said one diplomat in the region. “That is why he was blocked in the first time.”

But his daughter said he had informed UAE out of courtesy he planned to travel to France.

TARGET AT HOME

Shafik’s second declaration about being unable to travel was made on the Qatar-based Al Jazeera channel, criticized by UAE and Egypt as a mouthpiece for the Muslim Brotherhood, a charge it denies.

His daughter said the video had been leaked to Al Jazeera and had only been made as a precaution. But it triggered a wave of Egyptian pro-government media and talk-show criticism.

State-owned newspapers called Shafik “the fleeing air marshal” and said his lawyer had made deals with outlets sympathetic to the banned Muslim Brotherhood to help with Shafik’s campaign. They provided no evidence.

Two private lawyers filed complaints against Shafik with the public prosecutor in Egypt because of the Al Jazeera broadcast.

One Egyptian judicial source said on Saturday Shafik did not face criminal cases in Egypt. He was acquitted, or had charges dropped, in several cases in the past, including for corruption.

Sisi has yet to announce his own intentions for the election, saying he would follow the will of the people after presenting his achievements in the next two months.

His supporters dismiss criticism over rights abuses and say any measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers.

But his government is struggling to crush the insurgency in the North Sinai region and has also enacted painful austerity reforms over the last year to revive the economy which critics say have eroded his popularity.",Whereabouts of Egyptian ex-PM unknown since deportation home: family,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-politics/whereabouts-of-egyptian-ex-pm-unknown-since-deportation-home-family-idUSKBN1DW0HS?il=0

He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday.

The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.

“If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy – those expectations have been disappointed,” said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats in parliament.

“On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.”

Despite Tillerson’s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.

The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence.

Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis.

Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump’s foreign policy, diplomats said.

“LARGER DOSE OF TRUMP”

There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump.

“We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,” if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.

One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, “so it never left Tillerson much room.”

In addition, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace.

But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later.

Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say.

Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion).

The pressure has intensified since French media group Vivendi, TIM’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

Italy’s communications regulator AGCOM will decide by the middle of next year how to address competition concerns regarding TIM’s network, an AGCOM official said on Nov. 15.

'.”Neil Barnas, a USAF major who last year wrote a thesis on the potential of blockchain in defense, said U.S. military and security agencies were slowly waking up.","(Reuters) - Police and security agencies have so far only taken an interest in blockchain - the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin - for tracking criminals hiding illegal money from banks.

But that’s changing as some civilian, police and military agencies see blockchain as a potential solution to problems they have wrestled with for years: how to secure data, but also be able to share it in a way that lets the owner keep control.

Australia, for example, has recently hired HoustonKemp, a Singapore-based consultancy, to build a blockchain-based system to record intelligence created by investigators and others, and improve the way important information is shared.

“They’ve been trying for years to come up with a centralized platform, but people are reluctant to share information,” said Adrian Kemp, who runs the consultancy, which was awarded a A$1 million ($757,500) grant by AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.

Blockchain’s appeal for data sharing is threefold.

Its ledger, or database, is not controlled by any single party and is spread across multiple computers, making it hard to break. Once entered, any information cannot be altered or tampered with. And, by using so-called smart contracts, the owner of information can easily tweak who has access to what.

It’s a sign of how far blockchain technology has come within a decade since the publication of a pseudonymous paper describing bitcoin and the blockchain ledger that would record transactions in it.

Bitcoin has since become the preferred currency not only of libertarians and speculators, but also of criminal hackers. The bitcoin price is volatile, and hit record peaks late last month.

Governments are already exploring ways to store some data, such as land records, contracts and assets, in blockchains, and the financial industry, too, has experimented with blockchain technologies to streamline transactions and back-office systems, though with limited success.

SECURING SHARED DATA

The closest most law enforcement agencies have come to the blockchain has been working with start-up firms to analyze it for evidence of criminal deals.

But in the past year or so that attitude has begun to change.

The United States Air Force (USAF) has funded research into how blockchain could ensure its data isn’t changed. In May, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded a grant to the company behind an encrypted chat program to make a secure messaging service based on the blockchain.

Amendments to a recent U.S. Senate defense bill require the government to report back on “the potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies” and how foreign governments, extremists and criminals might be using them.

Britain, too, is exploring several uses of the blockchain, say consultants and companies working for several departments.

Cambridge Consultants, a UK-based consultancy, said it had worked with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, a UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) agency, on using a blockchain to improve the trustworthiness of a network of sensors on, for example, security cameras.

The UK’s justice ministry is looking at proving that evidence - video, emails, documents - hasn’t been tampered with by registering it all on a blockchain, according to a blog post on its website.

Marcus Ralphs, a former soldier and now CEO of ByzGen Ltd, which makes blockchains for the security sector, said he was working on projects with the MoD using blockchain to track the status and level of individuals’ security clearance. Other work included helping the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) improve the way work permits are issued and records stored.

“PASSING THE BUCK”

Adrian Kemp of HoustonKemp Economists speaks to Reuters in their office in Singapore November 24, 2017. Picture taken November 24, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su

These are early days.

Kemp says there’s no guarantee his project will be deployed more widely. And some who have worked with AUSTRAC are skeptical, saying such projects have more to do with agencies turning to the private sector because they’re running low on resources and ideas.

“The government is just looking to pass the buck on to private industry,” said Simon Smith, a cyber private investigator who has worked on cases involving AUSTRAC.

Many police forces and armies aren’t ready for the technological and mental leap necessary.

The Police Foundation, a UK think-tank focusing on policing and crime, is pushing British police to explore the blockchain, but its director, Rick Muir, said “we are still at the stage of ‘what is blockchain?'.”

Neil Barnas, a USAF major who last year wrote a thesis on the potential of blockchain in defense, said U.S. military and security agencies were slowly waking up.

The problem, he says, is that military minds are more inclined towards centralized systems than the decentralized ones that blockchain’s distributed ledger embraces.

That said, blockchain’s association with the criminal underworld has not dented its appeal to those who see its potential, said ByzGen’s Ralphs.

“The negative narrative around it has not at all watered down or diluted interest of the people we’ve been engaging with,” he said.

Morocco recalled its ambassador from South Africa in 2004 after former South African president Thabo Mbeki recognized a breakaway region in the Western Sahara which Morocco claims as part of its territory.

“Morocco is an African nation and we need to have relations with them,” Zuma told City Press in the interview. “We never had problems with them anyway; they were the first to withdraw diplomatic relations.”

Zuma met Morocco’s King Mohammed last week on the sidelines of an African Union-European Union summit.

“They felt that even if we differ on the Western Sahara issues, the two countries should have a relationship,” Zuma said about Moroccan officials’ position at the meeting.

South Africa’s official government position - as re-affirmed by Zuma in one of his state of the nation addresses - is to support “self determination and decolonization for the Western Sahara”.

The decision to re-establish ties with Morocco is likely to go down badly with some members of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC), of which Zuma is leader.

The ANC - as one of Africa’s oldest liberation movements - has long backed those seeking independence in the Western Sahara and has accused Morocco of occupying the region.

The ruling party said in a statement it had “unequivocal support for Western Sahara” but that this did not mean it harbored enmity toward Morocco.

“There is also no ANC policy that says South Africa should isolate Morocco,” the statement said.

A spokesman for South Africa’s foreign ministry could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Under a plea agreement, Schmidt faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of between $40,000 and $400,000 after admitting to conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violating clean air laws.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

“Es gibt keinen Automatismus für eine große Koalition”, sagte Parteichef Martin Schulz am Freitag nach dreistündigen Beratungen der engeren Parteiführung. “Wir werden auf dem SPD-Parteitag auch andere Varianten beraten.” CDU-Bundesgeschäftsführer Klaus Schüler sagte dagegen nach der Beratung des CDU-Bundesvorstands, seine Partei sei bereit für Gespräche über die Bildung einer “stabilen Regierung”. Mehrere CDU-Politiker zeigten sich überzeugt, dass es eine Neuauflage des Bündnisses aus Union und SPD geben werde.

Im “Spiegel” nannte Schulz Kernanliegen seiner Partei in Gesprächen mit der Union. Die deutsche Euro-Politik werde sich ändern müssen. Eine positive Antwort auf die EU-Reformvorschläge des französischen Präsidenten Emmanuel Macron werde “ein Kernelement bei jeder Verhandlung mit der SPD sein”. Er sei für eine gemeinsame europäische Sicherheitspolitik und einen EU-Finanzminister. Innenpolitisch werde seine Partei eine umfassende Erneuerung des Pflegesystems sowie der Gesundheitsversorgung zur Bedingung einer Regierungsbeteiligung machen, sagte Schulz.

Dagegen warnte CDU-Bundesgeschäftsführer Schüler die SPD vor roten Linien: “Wir sind für uns jedenfalls der Auffassung, dass wir bereit sind, ernsthaft in solche Gespräche einzutreten - das heißt auch ohne Vorbedingungen”, sagte er.

GROSSE VORBEHALTE IN DER SPD

Bundespräsident Frank-Walter Steinmeier sprach am Donnerstagabend gut zwei Stunden mit Bundeskanzlerin und CDU- Chefin Angela Merkel, Schulz und CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer im Schloss Bellevue. Er hatte alle Parteien unmittelbar nach dem Abbruch der Sondierungen für ein Jamaika-Bündnis aus Union, FDP und Grünen gewarnt, dass sie nicht auf Neuwahlen setzen sollten. Die SPD-Spitze sah sich dadurch zu einer Kehrtwende gezwungen, nachdem sie zunächst für Neuwahlen plädiert und eine große Koalition kategorisch ausgeschlossen hatte.

Aus Parteikreisen hieß es, Schulz habe sich in dem Gespräch offen für die Aufnahme von Gesprächen mit CDU und CSU gezeigt. Alle vier Teilnehmer seien sich zudem einig gewesen, dass das in anderen europäischen Ländern vorhandene Modell einer Minderheitsregierung nicht einfach auf Deutschland übertragen werden könne. In anderen Staaten gehe es meist um Minderheitsregierungen, die von Parteien aus dem gleichen politischen Lager unterstützt würden. Einige Politiker von SPD und CDU hatten für eine Minderheitsregierung votiert. “Ich persönlich halte nichts von einer Minderheitsregierung, auch nicht von Neuwahlen, denn es geht um Stabilität und es geht um Verlässlichkeit, Berechenbarkeit in sehr unruhigen Zeiten”, sagte CDU-Vize Julia Klöckner.

Schulz warf der Union vor, Quelle für einen “Bild”-Bericht gewesen zu sein, nach dem die SPD sich zu Gesprächen über eine große Koalition entschieden habe. Er habe Merkel in einem Telefonat am Mittag gesagt, dass so etwas inakzeptabel sei. Wer Falschmeldungen in Umlauf setze, zerstöre Vertrauen. Der Parteivorstand werde am Montag das weitere Vorgehen beschließen.

Aus SPD-Kreisen hieß es, ein Beschlussvorschlag des Parteivorstandes für den am Donnerstag beginnenden Bundesparteitag werde in die Richtung gehen, dass die SPD zu ergebnisoffenen Gesprächen mit der Union bereit sei. Partei-Vize Manuela Schwesig machte deutlich, dass es in der SPD keine einheitliche Linie gibt. “Klar ist, dass wir in unserer Partei sehr, sehr unterschiedliche Meinungen haben, von massiver Ablehnung der großen Koalition, aber auch Skepsis vor Neuwahlen und vielen Befürwortern von dritten Möglichkeiten”, sagte die Regierungschefin von Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. “Das Meinungsbild ist sehr verschieden.” Deshalb gelte es, in Ruhe zu beraten und zu versuchen, eine gemeinsame Lösung zu finden.

Die Tagesordnung für den dreitägigen Parteitag will die SPD offenbar umwerfen. Zum Auftakt soll nach einer Rede von Schulz nun zunächst über den Leitantrag mit der Linie für die Regierungsbildung debattiert und entschieden werden. Erst danach soll nach derzeitigen Überlegungen die Neuwahl der Parteispitze stattfinden, bei der sich Schulz zur Wiederwahl stellt. Bisher war vorgesehen, die Wahlen vor dem Leitantrag abzuhalten. Die SPD-Spitze will verhindern, dass sich bei der Wahl des Führungspersonals die in an Basis weit verbreitete Ablehnung einer großen Koalition in schlechten Ergebnissen entlädt.

FCA is often the subject of merger speculation, especially after its unsuccessful 2015 attempt to tie up with larger U.S. rival GM (GM.N). Its share price jumped to record highs in August after reports of interest from China and Hyundai.

“We already buy components from (Hyundai) .... let’s see if we can agree on other points, especially for the development of transmissions and hydrogen,” Marchionne told journalists, adding there was “nothing to announce for the moment”.

Asked whether this collaboration could turn into a merger, Marchionne said: “I don’t believe so”.

The 65-year-old chief executive, whose mandate ends in April 2019, is working on a new business plan to 2022, which he said should be presented in the second quarter of next year.

As part of that strategy and to simplify its portfolio, FCA is working on separating two of its three components businesses.

Marchionne said the spin-offs of Magneti Marelli - which makes components for lighting, engines, electronics, suspension and exhausts - and robotics maker Comau would be separate operations, “especially given Comau’s potential development in artificial intelligence or robotics”.

“Whether it happens as a spin-off or a distribution to shareholders, or whether we will raise some money in the process -- all things to be discussed with the board, we haven’t made up our mind,” he said.

These discussions include a potential listing for either company as happened with other units FCA spun off in the past, such as tractor maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) (CNHI.N) or luxury sportscar group Ferrari (RACE.MI) (RACE.N), which are quoted in Milan and New York.

Marchionne added that he would like to complete the separations by the end of 2018. The transaction could help boost FCA’s finances at a time when it is aiming to become cash-positive by the end of next year.

A separation of castings firm Teksid, the smallest of FCA’s parts makers, was not on the table, Marchionne said, adding that any spin-off of the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands would not happen “for many years”.

The new complaints represent the latest development in a long-standing dispute and follows Apple’s countersuit on Wednesday against Qualcomm, which alleged that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon mobile phone chips infringed on Apple patents.

Apple declined to comment on the new cases, referring to its earlier claims in its Wednesday filing that the company has developed its own technology and patents to power its iPhones.

Qualcomm in July accused Apple of infringing several patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life.

That case accompanied a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban the import of Apple iPhones that use competing Intel Corp (INTC.O) chips because of the alleged patent violations.

The three cases filed Thursday were all filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. One of the cases is a companion civil lawsuit to a new complaint also filed Thursday with the ITC that seeks the same remedy of banning iPhones with Intel chips. The other two cases are civil patent infringement lawsuits.

But that’s changing as some civilian, police and military agencies see blockchain as a potential solution to problems they have wrestled with for years: how to secure data, but also be able to share it in a way that lets the owner keep control.

Australia, for example, has recently hired HoustonKemp, a Singapore-based consultancy, to build a blockchain-based system to record intelligence created by investigators and others, and improve the way important information is shared.

“They’ve been trying for years to come up with a centralized platform, but people are reluctant to share information,” said Adrian Kemp, who runs the consultancy, which was awarded a A$1 million ($757,500) grant by AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.

Blockchain’s appeal for data sharing is threefold.

Its ledger, or database, is not controlled by any single party and is spread across multiple computers, making it hard to break. Once entered, any information cannot be altered or tampered with. And, by using so-called smart contracts, the owner of information can easily tweak who has access to what.

It’s a sign of how far blockchain technology has come within a decade since the publication of a pseudonymous paper describing bitcoin and the blockchain ledger that would record transactions in it.

Bitcoin has since become the preferred currency not only of libertarians and speculators, but also of criminal hackers. The bitcoin price is volatile, and hit record peaks late last month.

Governments are already exploring ways to store some data, such as land records, contracts and assets, in blockchains, and the financial industry, too, has experimented with blockchain technologies to streamline transactions and back-office systems, though with limited success.

SECURING SHARED DATA

The closest most law enforcement agencies have come to the blockchain has been working with start-up firms to analyze it for evidence of criminal deals.

But in the past year or so that attitude has begun to change.

The United States Air Force (USAF) has funded research into how blockchain could ensure its data isn’t changed. In May, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded a grant to the company behind an encrypted chat program to make a secure messaging service based on the blockchain.

Amendments to a recent U.S. Senate defense bill require the government to report back on “the potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies” and how foreign governments, extremists and criminals might be using them.

Britain, too, is exploring several uses of the blockchain, say consultants and companies working for several departments.

Cambridge Consultants, a UK-based consultancy, said it had worked with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, a UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) agency, on using a blockchain to improve the trustworthiness of a network of sensors on, for example, security cameras.

The UK’s justice ministry is looking at proving that evidence - video, emails, documents - hasn’t been tampered with by registering it all on a blockchain, according to a blog post on its website.

Marcus Ralphs, a former soldier and now CEO of ByzGen Ltd, which makes blockchains for the security sector, said he was working on projects with the MoD using blockchain to track the status and level of individuals’ security clearance. Other work included helping the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) improve the way work permits are issued and records stored.

“PASSING THE BUCK”

These are early days.

Kemp says there’s no guarantee his project will be deployed more widely. And some who have worked with AUSTRAC are skeptical, saying such projects have more to do with agencies turning to the private sector because they’re running low on resources and ideas.

“The government is just looking to pass the buck on to private industry,” said Simon Smith, a cyber private investigator who has worked on cases involving AUSTRAC.

Many police forces and armies aren’t ready for the technological and mental leap necessary.

The Police Foundation, a UK think-tank focusing on policing and crime, is pushing British police to explore the blockchain, but its director, Rick Muir, said “we are still at the stage of ‘what is blockchain?'.”

Neil Barnas, a USAF major who last year wrote a thesis on the potential of blockchain in defense, said U.S. military and security agencies were slowly waking up.

The problem, he says, is that military minds are more inclined towards centralized systems than the decentralized ones that blockchain’s distributed ledger embraces.

That said, blockchain’s association with the criminal underworld has not dented its appeal to those who see its potential, said ByzGen’s Ralphs.

“The negative narrative around it has not at all watered down or diluted interest of the people we’ve been engaging with,” he said.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

The answer is that the president could take executive action that circumscribes his own authority to launch a nuclear first strike.
As Feaver told me in an interview that followed his Senate testimony, the president could order additional controls on nuclear decision making.","From the beginnings of the 2016 general election through the presidential debates and on to his “fire and fury” comments on North Korea this summer, the prospect of a president as impulsive as Donald Trump in command of nuclear weapons has worried experts in both parties and career military and government officials. This week’s North Korean test of a missile that might be able to reach the entire U.S. mainland with a nuclear warhead — and Trump’s initial response that “we will take care of it” — can hardly be expected to diminish the anxiety.

The simmering concern had already reached a medium boil last week when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony on the president’s authority to order a nuclear attack. The Senate hearing came at the behest of committee chairman Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who, since announcing he would not run for reelection next year, has publicly fretted that Trump’s intemperate tweets and other public pronouncements risk putting the United States “on the path to World War III.” A Democratic member of the committee, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, echoed those concerns during the hearing, saying, “the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests.”

But as the Senate hearing and subsequent commentary made clear, concern about Trump’s authority to launch an unwarranted first-strike nuclear attack is one thing; circumscribing that authority is quite another. The president holds the constitutional position of commander in chief and is obligated to protect the United States from foreign threats. The Constitution does grant to Congress the power to declare war, but it is unclear whether a law that significantly constrained the president’s nuclear command authority — particularly when the United States or it allies are under attack or in imminent danger of attack — would be constitutional. Also, as former National Security Council staffer and Duke political science professor Peter Feaver noted in his Senate testimony, legislation that attempts to alter the nuclear chain of command could have unintended and dangerous consequences, perhaps leading adversaries and allies to question the United States’ ability to respond quickly during a crisis.

There are ways out of this constitutional and legislative dilemma, at least as regards a first nuclear strike by U.S. forces. The difficulty is that they require the participation of Trump himself.

In recent months, a bill proposed by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Ted Lieu of California — the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017 — has gained support from experts and activists concerned by Trump’s control of U.S. nuclear weapon use. The bill would prohibit the president from conducting “a first-use nuclear strike unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a congressional declaration of war expressly authorizing such strike.” But the Lieu-Markey bill — in my opinion an admirable effort to create a check against wanton nuclear war-making — is sponsored by two liberal Democrats and has approximately zero chance of passing the current Republican-controlled Congress.

If effective congressional action is unlikely in the short term, what might work to reassure government officials of both parties and the citizens they represent? The answer is that the president could take executive action that circumscribes his own authority to launch a nuclear first strike.

There is nothing to stop U.S. presidents from reining in their own nuclear command authority. When the United States is not under (or at imminent threat of) nuclear attack, the nuclear command and control system already contains some restraints on presidential authority, including military commanders trained to make sure that a nuclear launch order is legal. As Feaver told me in an interview that followed his Senate testimony, the president could order additional controls on nuclear decision making. “I don’t think that you could impose over a determinately hostile executive branch a legislative fix that actually would work,” he said. “But [Congress] could cooperate with the executive branch on legislative fixes, and better yet, it could, through oversight and review, make recommendations that the executive branch would adopt on its own, recognizing that they’re worth doing.”

Just as the Obama administration laid out strict guidelines for authorizing drone attacks on terrorist targets, Feaver said, the Trump administration could adopt a policy that, for example, required certain cabinet members to determine whether a president’s first-strike nuclear order is legal and complies with U.S. treaty obligations before it can be acted on.

An executive order formally requiring that, for example, the secretaries of defense and state sign off on any presidential order of a first nuclear strike before it is sent to military commanders would go a great way toward assuaging concerns about presidential impulsiveness — particularly at a time when the North Korea confrontation looms large in the public consciousness. Such a “three-key” reform could therefore be of enormous political benefit to Trump, reassuring both domestic audiences and allied countries that he will not explode early some morning and, after an angry tweet or two, order up an attack on Pyongyang that triggers doomsday.

To have credibility, any such reforms would need to be closely vetted by congressional and military experts. They would have to ensure that while the presidential power to initiate first-strike attacks could be curbed, presidents could still respond immediately and effectively when the United States is under attack, or an attack is clearly impending. In matters pertaining to the continued existence of humanity, details matter.

Because they would be enacted by executive order, the reforms of course would not necessarily outlive the Trump administration; a future president could undo them by fiat.

But if they were wisely crafted, procedural safeguards against a president’s unilateral misuse of his authority to order a first nuclear strike would likely be welcomed by people in America and around the world, and those safeguards might serve as a powerful precedent. Beyond the political benefits these reforms would provide Trump today, they could serve as a long-term legacy for a president who so far has struggled to get major legislation passed.

Trump’s personality and leadership style make it highly unlikely that he’ll agree to limit his own powers. But if he doesn’t want to make such a move, it’s time to start thinking about how to persuade his successor to think differently about control of the nuclear button.",Commentary: Can Congress stop a president waging nuclear war?,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-mecklin-nuclear-commentary/commentary-can-congress-stop-a-president-waging-nuclear-war-idUKKBN1DU2HW

The 65-year-old chief executive, whose mandate ends in April 2019, is working on a new business plan to 2022, which he said should be presented in the second quarter of next year.

As part of that strategy and to simplify its portfolio, FCA is working on separating two of its three components businesses.

Marchionne said the spin-offs of Magneti Marelli - which makes components for lighting, engines, electronics, suspension and exhausts - and robotics maker Comau would be separate operations, “especially given Comau’s potential development in artificial intelligence or robotics”.

“Whether it happens as a spin-off or a distribution to shareholders, or whether we will raise some money in the process -- all things to be discussed with the board, we haven’t made up our mind,” he said.

These discussions include a potential listing for either company as happened with other units FCA spun off in the past, such as tractor maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) (CNHI.N) or luxury sportscar group Ferrari (RACE.MI) (RACE.N), which are quoted in Milan and New York.

Marchionne added that he would like to complete the separations by the end of 2018. The transaction could help boost FCA’s finances at a time when it is aiming to become cash-positive by the end of next year.

A separation of castings firm Teksid, the smallest of FCA’s parts makers, was not on the table, Marchionne said, adding that any spin-off of the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands would not happen “for many years”.

Asked about possible fines over diesel emissions, Marchionne said he did not believe there was any legal base in recent allegations raised by French authorities.

He added that separate discussions with U.S. authorities were ongoing and he expects “there will be a cost but it will be something manageable”.",Fiat Chrysler CEO says in talks with Hyundai on tech partnership,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiatchrysler-spinoffs/fiat-chrysler-ceo-says-in-talks-with-hyundai-on-tech-partnership-idUSKBN1DW0JQ

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.

The accelerated pace of North Korea’s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.

On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday.

Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.

“It’s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,” the Alabama Congressman and Republican told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California.

When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill‎ said in a statement: “The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.”

The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department.

Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are “competing” for the missile defense installations.

Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites.

The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined.

THAAD is a ground-based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install.

In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed.

A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company “is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.” He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision.

In July, the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The successful test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military’s missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures.

Currently, the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD) in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships. The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD.

The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

North Korea’s latest missile test puts the U.S. capital within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday.",Exclusive: Pentagon evaluating U.S. West Coast missile defense sites - officials,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-defense-westcoast-exclusive/exclusive-pentagon-evaluating-u-s-west-coast-missile-defence-sites-officials-idUKKBN1DX04N

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

Now, the conversation should turn against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s gutting of campus sexual assault procedures.

DeVos has rejected Obama-era guidelines on how colleges investigate sexual assault, saying that the rights of the accused were being violated and that schools will be permitted to use whatever standard of proof they deem fair while the Department of Education (DOE) sorts out new guidelines.

To make matters more confusing, a footnote in DOE’s recommendations added that the standard of evidence for sexual allegations should be consistent with whatever standard the school uses in other student misconduct cases. Left unexplained, because it makes no sense, is why sexual assault should be treated the same as, say, plagiarism − which comes with written evidence and no traumatized young victim. (The DOE did not respond to a request for comment on the guidelines.)

John Lloyd: Britain's mess extends beyond Brexit

Sexual assault on college campuses is a long-standing scourge: nearly one in five women will be sexually assaulted while in college. It’s also a complex crime to combat, happening, as it does, under special circumstances: In an environment where both alleged victim and alleged perpetrator may both be living and studying on a self-contained campus where conflicts and even criminal behavior is often mediated by the school rather than law enforcement.

The way colleges and universities handle sexual assault complaints has long been inadequate, with female victims of assault often disadvantaged by an institution that has an incentive to sweep assault under the rug. (The parents of a prospective applicant surely don’t want to hear that a school has a rape problem.) As a result, many assault victims, forced to go through meaningless mediation processes or stay in classes and dorms with their assailants, dropped out (or failed out because of post-traumatic stress disorder), curtailing their college careers and hampering their own futures, while their assailants were able to graduate and continue on as if nothing happened.

In 2011 the Obama administration’s DOE issued guidelines to put the accused and the accuser on more equal footing. The guidelines, outlined in a “Dear Colleague” letter, encouraged schools adjudicating sexual assault to use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard in determining fault – that is, is it more likely than not that the accused committed the act in question?

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos gives a policy address on rape and sexual assault on college and university campuses, at George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., September 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Theiler

This is a lower burden of proof than in criminal cases, where the stakes – jail time and the attendant curtailing of one’s liberties – are much higher. It’s also a lower burden of proof than the “clear and convincing evidence” standard, which is used in some civil cases.

But “preponderance of the evidence” is the standard used in civil cases involving sex and race discrimination. The reason colleges are adjudicating sexual assault cases in the first place is because of Title IX, a federal anti-discrimination statute dictating that women should have equal access to education. Sexual assault impedes equal access, making it a Title IX discrimination issue, so the standard of evidence often used in civil discrimination cases is appropriate.

This has not gone over well with men’s rights activists, many conservatives, and some advocates for the rights of the accused. For some, the evidentiary standard itself is too low; opinions of what should be used instead vary from none at all (the argument being that colleges should avoid this entirely and require any reports of assault to go to the police) to a “clear and convincing” standard, which is a higher bar than preponderance of the evidence. Others, including me, believe the evidentiary standard is not the problem but are troubled that the adjudication processes vary wildly from school to school, and are often opaque, incomprehensible, and done without clear rules of evidence and the right of each party to have an advocate. In any case, for many conservatives, the whole system is unfairly skewed. For many feminists, the Obama rules were a step in the right direction, but are being implemented poorly.

Enter DeVos, who early in her tenure invited men’s rights groups to meet with her to discuss the issue. These are such vicious misogynists that one of their leaders said about NFL player Ray Rice’s then-fiancé, whom he attacked on camera in an elevator and knocked unconscious, “if she hadn’t aggravated him, she wouldn’t have been hit.” Candice E. Jackson, one of DeVos’s top deputies, told The New York Times that sexual assault “accusations — 90 percent of them — fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because [the victim] just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.’” Let’s also not forget that DeVos serves in an administration headed by Donald Trump, who has boasted of grabbing women’s genitals.

So it was no surprise that DeVos is overturning the Obama-era directives. This is the worst possible approach. Even though there was roiling debate over which standard to use, everyone agreed that lack of clarity on rules was an ongoing issue. The DeVos directive muddied the waters even further.

But in the wake of Weinstein, we see why this matters – and why simply turning this matter over to law enforcement is not a viable option. Many of the women who say Weinstein harassed or assaulted them would not be able to prove it in a court of law, given that physical evidence was limited or non-existent, and the case would come down to her version of events versus his. Even when police did have evidence in the form of audio recordings wherein Weinstein admitted to criminal misdeeds, the district attorney chose not to prosecute. For women in Hollywood, making a powerful enemy while being powerless to fight back meant stalled careers and emotional distress. For women on college campuses, having an assault go ignored can mean everything they have worked for up until that point in their lives is lost: Their degree, their social and prospective professional network and their sense of safety in their own homes and communities.

Research on sexual assailants is disturbingly limited, but we do know that many campus attackers are, like Weinstein, serial offenders. And we know that, like Weinstein, they target the most vulnerable – women who are new on campus and don’t have a strong social network, and women of lower socioeconomic classes who are considered more disposable than the women who are considered a frat boy’s social and economic peers.

On campuses across the United States, women make the same calculation as Weinstein’s accusers did when they kept silent for years. What will I have to go through to prove what happened to me? What do I stand to lose – my reputation, my friends, my dignity, my future?

When women don’t see a fair path to justice, they don’t report assaults. Most rapes still go unreported, on campus and off of it, often because women are ashamed and afraid of being disbelieved. DeVos is making this already-tough road even steeper. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the Weinstein case, it’s that the last thing victims need are more barriers blocking their way.",Commentary: The next front in the fight against sexual assault,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-filipovic-rape-commentary/commentary-the-next-front-in-the-fight-against-sexual-assault-idUSKBN1DE2WD

Homosexuality is a criminal offense in the East African nation, where a conviction for having “carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature” can carry a life sentence. The woman, who police said resides in the northwestern Tanzanian town of Geita, was arrested after a video circulated on social media showing a woman kissing and hugging another woman and presenting her with a ring.

“I can confirm that a Tanzanian woman is under police custody over that video clip. We will issue more details later after we conclude our investigation,” Geita police chief Mponjoli Mwabulambo told Reuters by telephone on Saturday.

Tanzanian president John Magufuli’s government has stepped up a crackdown against homosexuality since coming into power in 2015 and threatened in June to arrest and expel activists, as well as deregister all non-governmental organizations that campaign for gay rights. In October, authorities in the main city Dar es Salaam raided a meeting at a hotel, saying the gathering was promoting same-sex relationships, and arrested at least 12 men.

The arrest of the woman in Geita was thought to be the first arrest of a lesbian suspect in the recent crackdown and police sources said authorities were also searching for the woman who was given the ring in the video clip.

Reuters could not confirm where or when the video the filmed.

The clip drew condemnation on social media platforms in the socially conservative nation, with some Tanzanians condemning the celebration as immoral.

“Both of them should be arrested. Why did the woman accept an engagement ring from another woman?” Cosmas Alele, a resident of the northwestern town of Kagera said on Twitter, writing in Kiswahili.

Since homosexuality is a criminal offense in Tanzania, rights groups are reluctant to speak publicly in defense of gay rights.

Further cuts won’t boost prices to the point where Saudi’s budget is in balance. Then again, that gives Saudi’s young crown prince a reason to continue reforms.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ cuts, which started just shy of a year ago, took some time to show up in the numbers. By October, helped by healthy demand for oil, commercial inventories among OECD countries had fallen to just 140 million barrels more than the five-year moving average, draining more than half the previous glut. The cuts have helped push up Brent crude prices more than 10 percent this year.

Saudi Arabia has become more disciplined in its spending, too. The kingdom gets the bulk of its oil revenue by taxing oil producer Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE. A cut to the company’s tax rate ahead of its initial public offering could reduce the state’s haul, but so far, Saudi’s finances are going in a helpful direction. The International Monetary Fund says the country’s fiscal breakeven will fall almost a quarter in 2017 from the last year to $73.10 per barrel.

OPEC’s restraint could push prices up more in the nearer term – on Thursday the price rose over 1 percent to nearly $64. But it helps Saudi’s financial position only to a point. Shale drillers in the United States are stepping in to make up for some of OPEC’s declines, which will keep prices in check next year. And if cuts don’t have a more visible effect, some OPEC members might start to wonder what the point is. The IMF predicts oil staying around $50. The Energy Information Administration pegs the price slightly higher at $56 a barrel.

This plays nicely into the narrative created by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. His grand vision of diversifying the country’s economy away from oil has spawned plans for giant new cities in the desert, moderate social liberalization, and a corruption purge that touched on several royal family members.

The individual mandate is meant to ensure a viable health insurance market by forcing younger and healthier Americans to buy coverage to help offset the cost of sicker patients. It helps uphold the most popular provision of the law, which requires insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates.

Removing it while keeping the rest of Obama’s Affordable Care Act intact is expected to cause insurance premiums to rise and lead to millions of people losing coverage, policy experts say.

“It’s going to take a bunch of healthy people out of the insurance market,” said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

Obamacare “is going to collapse even more now,” he said.

Republican lawmakers failed several times this year to scrap the mandate as part of a broader repeal of Obamacare, blocked by opposition from a few of the party’s senators, including Susan Collins of Maine.

Collins, still opposed to removing the mandate, said she voted for the tax bill on Saturday after being assured by Republican leaders that they will support legislation to prop up U.S. health insurance markets.

The tax bill is not yet final. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate must now reconcile the differences in their respective versions of the legislation.

“Instead of taxing people for not being able to afford coverage, we should be working to reduce costs and provide options.”

One of the Obamacare stabilization bills, co-authored by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray, would restore billions of dollars in subsidies that health insurers use to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low income Americans.

A second, co-authored by Collins and Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, would create an additional $4.5 billion fund to compensate insurers for covering health care for the sickest patients.

Still, health policy experts said both of those measures would be needed without a mandate repeal and would not make up for expected premium increases and the rise in the numbers of uninsured Americans.

“Neither of these bills would do anything to offset the increase in uninsured resulting from a mandate repeal,” said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The marketplaces would limp along without a mandate but it’s probably not a stable place.”

Without the mandate, health insurance premiums would rise 10 percent in most years over the next decade on the individual market and 13 million people would lose coverage by 2027, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report last month.

Levitt said that insurers would need around $10 billion per year to offset the lost revenue from the individual mandate rather than raise premiums.

Republicans, who control the White House, U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, failed for months to make good on a top campaign pledge of President Donald Trump.

Trump has said Congress will return to repeal-and-replace efforts next year and over the past several months has taken regulatory and executive actions to steadily undermine the Obamacare law.

Insurers and leading medical groups have already urged Congress to preserve the individual mandate and warned of “serious consequences” such as rising premiums and a rise in the number of uninsured if it were repealed.",U.S. Senate tax bill accomplishes major Obamacare repeal goal,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-healthcare/u-s-senate-tax-bill-accomplishes-major-obamacare-repeal-goal-idUSKBN1DW07T?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State with Washington’s backing. The SDF offensive in Deir al-Zor province, which borders Iraq, has focused on territory east of the Euphrates river.

On the western bank, the Syrian military has waged its own attack against Islamic State with support from Iran-backed militias and Russia.

The separate assaults advanced from opposite sides of the river, which bisects oil-rich Deir al-Zor, mostly staying out of each other’s way. The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have held deconfliction meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict.

The SDF’s most powerful component, the YPG, announced that it had defeated Islamic State militants on its side “in cooperation with the Arab tribes.”

The U.S.-led coalition and Russian forces in Syria provided “air and logistical support, advice and coordination on the ground,” its statement said. “We hope for an increase in this support and for ensuring the necessary air cover.”

A YPG spokesman declared the victory in a village in Deir al-Zor in the presence of a Russian envoy from Moscow’s Hmeimim military base in Syria, it said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this week that as the battle against Islamic State entered its final stages, he expected the focus to move toward holding territory instead of arming Syrian Kurdish fighters.

Washington’s support for the YPG has infuriated Turkey, which sees the growing influence of Kurdish forces on its border as a security threat. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) movement, which has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.

Since the start of Syria’s conflict in 2011, the YPG and its allies have carved out autonomous regions in the north. They now control around a quarter of Syria, the largest part outside government control, after seizing vast land from Islamic State.

Their autonomy plans face opposition from their battlefield ally Washington, from Turkey and from the Syrian government.

The YPG said on Sunday it was forming civil councils for Deir al-Zor that include Kurds, Arabs and other components based on “the principle of democracy and self-rule.” It would mirror governing arrangements in other towns and cities that the Kurdish fighters and their allies captured.

With Islamic State close to collapse in Syria, Syrian Kurdish leaders hope for a phase of negotiations to shore up their autonomy in the north.

Speaking to reporters aboard the plane returning to Rome from Bangladesh, the pontiff also indicated that he had been firm with Myanmar’s military leaders in private meetings about the need for them to respect the rights of Rohingya refugees.

He also disclosed that he cried when he met a group of Rohingya refugees on Friday in Bangladesh, where he defended their rights by name in an emotional meeting.

“For me, the most important thing is that message gets through, to try to say things one step at a time and listen to the responses,” he said.

“I knew that if in the official speeches I would have used that word, they would have closed the door in our faces. But (in public) I described situations, rights, said that no one should be excluded, (the right to) citizenship, in order to allow myself to go further in the private meetings,” he said.

Francis did not use the word Rohingya in public while on the first leg of the trip in Myanmar. Predominantly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the mostly Muslim Rohingya as an ethnic group with its own identity but as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Local Roman Catholic Church authorities had advised him not to say it because it could spark a backlash against Christians and other minority groups.

The pope met Myanmar’s military leaders privately on Monday, shortly after his arrival in the nation’s biggest city, Yangon.

The meeting had been scheduled for Thursday morning but the military pointedly asked at the last minute that it be pushed forward. The result was they saw the pope before the civilian leaders instead of the other way around, as had been planned.

NON-NEGOTIABLE TRUTHS

“It was a good conversation and the truth was non-negotiable,” he said of his meeting with the military leaders.

The latest exodus from Myanmar to Bangladesh of about 625,000 people followed a Myanmar military crackdown in response to Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on Aug. 25.

Refugees have said scores of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, people were killed and women were raped. The military have denied accusations of ethnic cleansing by the United States and United Nations.

Asked if he used the word Rohingya during the private meeting with the military chiefs, the pope said: “I used words in order to arrive at the message and when I saw that the message had arrived, I dared to say everything that I wanted say”.

Slideshow (2 Images)

He then gave a reporter a mischievous grin and ended his answer with the Latin phrase “Intelligenti Pauca,” which means “Few words are enough for those who understand,” strongly hinting that he had used the word the military detests while in their presence.

Human rights groups have criticized the country’s de facto civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who was under house arrest for a total of 15 years before the 2015 elections, for not taking a stand against the generals.

But Francis, who met with her privately on Tuesday, appeared to give her the benefit of the doubt because of her delicate relationship with the generals who were once her jailers.

“Myanmar is a nation that is growing politically, in transition,” Francis said in response to a question about Suu Kyi and budding democracy in Myanmar.

“So things have to be viewed through this lens. Myanmar has to be able to look forward to the building of the country”.

On Friday in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, Francis held an emotional encounter with Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and then used the word Rohingya for the first time on the trip, although he had defended them by name twice from the Vatican earlier this year.

He told the crowd where the Rohingya were that God’s presence was within them and they should be respected.

“I was crying and tried to hide it,” Francis said on the plane, recounting how moved he felt when the refugees recounted their ordeals to him.",Pope says his defense of Rohingya got through in Myanmar,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-asia/pope-says-his-defense-of-rohingya-got-through-in-myanmar-idUSKBN1DW0R2?il=0

“Strasbourg must remain the seat of European democracy. It’s also the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation,” she said on France 3 television.

“It is often said that Europe comes down to the Brussels bubble. Europe needs to be closer to its regions,” she added.

Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) convene in Strasbourg for one week every month and in Brussels for the remainder. The monthly upheaval costs the bloc 114 million euros ($124 million) a year, EU auditors say.

Critics have long called for the arrangement to be scrapped, but it has stayed in place largely because France would have vetoed any attempt to make the required amendment to the EU treaty.

Some lawmakers had hoped the election victory of pro-EU President Emmanuel Macron could help plans to close the base in the French city.

On Brexit negotiations, Loiseau said there were “positive noises” ahead of a summit in Brussels set to decide whether enough progress has been made on the first phase of negotiations to move on to talks about a post-Brexit trade relationship.

But she said France remained vigilant on the issue of the land border with Ireland. “It’s a red line which was drawn by the 27 member states and by the United Kingdom, accepted by them,” she said.

Loiseau also said France was waiting for conclusions from the Eurostat statistics agency on whether the reimbursements it is due to make to companies after a dividend tax was canceled by courts should be all included in its 2017 accounts.

That would scupper the French government’s plans to bring its budget deficit below the EU-mandated 3 percent in 2017.

“In all logic, there is no reason to attribute the whole 10 billion euros to 2017. That’s what we explained, we are waiting for Eurostat answers,” she said.

Loiseau, a career diplomat, also said she was disappointed by Germany’s decision to vote in favor of clearing the use of weedkiller glyphosate for the next five years earlier this week.","European parliament not moving from Strasbourg, France says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-eu/european-parliament-not-moving-from-strasbourg-france-says-idUKKBN1DX0I1

His interim replacement will be self-described ""right-wing nutjob"" Mick Mulvaney.

Currently the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget Director, Mulvaney is a longtime politician who has tirelessly worked to dismantle regulations and, as CBS News notes, “a longtime critic of the agency.” Nominating Mulvaney, in other words, is functionally equivalent to eliminating the agency entirely.

This ominous sign is the latest example of the Trump administration’s determination to dismantle critical regulations of big business. And it illustrates how the executive branch now unilaterally makes public policy. Trump and a Republican Congress haven’t yet passed major legislation, but they can achieve a lot of policy objectives without doing so.

One of the most important components of the flawed but valuable Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was the creation of the CFPB. The bureau is empowered to regulate financial products and services to prevent the exploitation of consumers. What Trump, congressional Republicans, and the financial sector hated about Cordray is that he did his job. According to Ranae Merle of the Washington Post, “Republicans had become increasingly exasperated that Cordray… continued to press for aggressive rules disliked by the business community. Trump has on at least two occasions griped about Cordray in private and wondered what to do about his tenure.” When Trump said he would “drain the swamp,” he apparently meant that he would clear out anything that would impede Wall Street from exploiting consumers.

Wall Street and Republicans have tried to stymie the CFPB from the beginning. The lesson Republicans took from the disastrous 2008 financial collapse that was created in part by banks taking advantage of customers was that everything was just fine. Senate Republicans were determined not to let Obama nominate anyone to head the agency, and carried out a lengthy filibuster against Cordray, forcing Obama to install him as a temporary recess appointment. (Cordray was later confirmed for a full term.) They haven’t changed at all, and the idea that Trump would orient the party in a more anti-Wall Street direction has been revealed as the ludicrous fantasy it always was.

Congress acting against CPFB regulations may have been the reason Cordray was frustrated enough to leave early. Last month, with Vice-President Mike Pence casting the deciding Senate vote, Congress killed a new rule that protected the ability of consumers to file class action lawsuits against banks, rather than being forced into arbitration that generally tilts toward the interests of the corporation rather than the customer.

Still, because Senate Republicans don’t have the votes to break a Democratic filibuster and overturn or rewrite Dodd-Frank, there’s a limit to what Congress can do to eviscerate the CFPB. And that’s where Trump’s appointments come in. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now being headed by former Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton, who is universally expected to treat his former employers much more kindly than his predecessor, Mary Jo White. In February, Trump’s Department of Labor stopped a rule that would have required financial advisors to act the fiduciary interest of their clients.

This illustrates a real dilemma for the Democratic Party. Without repealing any statutes, Republicans can severely undermine public interest regulation. Both parties, but especially the GOP, have in recent years begun to use every legal lever at their disposal to enact their will, violating past political norms. Instead of nominating a permanent appointee to run CFPB, which would require a Senate vote, Trump has put an acting director – who will keep running OMB – to dismantle the agency without even needing Senate approval. These days, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headed by a Republican appointee is likely to ignore corporate malfeasance and act to undo any strong rules put into place.

This problem is hardly confined to one area of governance. Scott Pruitt’s Environmental Protection Agency is busily acting to dismantle major environmental regulations. The Voting Rights Act is toothless with Jeff Sessions, seen by civil rights activists as a staunch supporter of vote suppression, as Attorney General. And this is the problem with trying to regulate in the interests of ordinary people while one of America’s major political parties is staunchly opposed to such efforts. The Democratic Party can’t protect the public merely by passing laws establishing regulatory agencies: when a Democrat isn’t in the White House, Republican presidents can seriously damage enforcement even if they can’t get legislation repealed. Elections tend to focus on what new laws can be passed, but there needs to be more focus on how existing laws are implemented.",Commentary: How Trump is making it easier to exploit consumers,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-consumer-commentary/commentary-how-trump-is-making-it-easier-to-exploit-consumers-idUSKBN1DG35S

Already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington have deteriorated as Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors, detailed in court a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions.

Erdogan said Turkey’s dealings were in line with the decisions of the United Nations, adding that they were not against Ankara’s alliance with Washington.

“What have we done, for example? We bought natural gas from a country we have an agreement with so our citizens wouldn’t be cold in the winter. Like other countries, only the UN’s decisions bind us, and Turkey followed them to the dot,” he told members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus.

Over three days of testimony, Zarrab has implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said on Thursday that when Erdogan was prime minister he had authorized a transaction to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

“This case is nothing more than the 17-25 December plot being carried across the ocean. Excuse us, but we will not succumb to this blackmail,” Erdogan said, referring to 2013 leaks about alleged government corruption which were blamed on his opponents.

Although he has not yet responded to the courtroom claims, Erdogan has dismissed the case as a politically motivated attempt to bring down the Turkish government, led by Gulen.

Turkey has repeatedly requested Gulen’s extradition, but U.S. officials have said the courts require sufficient evidence before they can extradite the elderly cleric, who has denied any involvement in the coup.

Scientists said on Tuesday that genetic analysis of nine bone, tooth, skin, hair and fecal samples from museum and private collections attributed to the yeti, also called the Abominable Snowman, found that eight came from Asian black bears, Himalayan brown bears or Tibetan brown bears and one came from a dog.

“This strongly suggests that the yeti legend has a root in biological facts and that is has to do with bears that are living in the region today,” said biologist Charlotte Lindqvist of the University at Buffalo in New York and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, who led the study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Lindqvist called the study the most rigorous analysis to date of purported yeti specimens. The researchers sequenced mitochondrial DNA, genetic material in structures within cells that was passed down from mothers, of purported yeti samples from Tibet, India and Nepal as well as from black, brown and polar bear populations.

The yeti is a creature of folklore in the Himalayan region that has become a part of Western popular culture. It is separate from North America’s Sasquatch and Big Foot folklore.

“I initially became involved in this study when I was contacted about a previous study that found two purported yeti samples to match genetically with an ancient, 120,000-year-old polar bear that I was doing research on,” Lindqvist said.

“But the data was very limited, and it made me suspicious about the speculation that the yeti legend represented some strange, hybrid bear roaming the Himalaya mountains. So, I agreed to follow up on this study with a more rigorous approach based on more genetic data from more purported yeti samples,” Lindqvist added.

Lindqvist said purported yeti samples came from places including the Messner Mountain Museum in Italy and were gathered by British independent television production company Icon Films.

While no actual yeti was identified, the DNA research shed light on bear populations in the region.

The brown bears roaming the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and those in the western Himalayan mountains appear to belong to two separate bear populations separated from each other for thousands of years, despite their relative geographic proximity, Lindqvist said.","Abominable news: Purported yeti evidence came from bears, dog",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DT01X

A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East.

Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to “discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern”, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.

“It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and holds a very high risk of provoking Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities in the West,” said the diplomatic source, asking not to be named.

King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.

Word of Trump’s planned announcement, which would deviate from previous U.S. presidents who have insisted the Jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority and was sure to anger the broader Arab world.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel’s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city’s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.

“It is essential no unilateral decisions are made that would change the historic status quo of Jerusalem as an occupied city whose fate needs to be determined in final status talks within an overall peace package,” the senior Jordanian diplomatic source added.",Jordan begins diplomatic offensive ahead of Trump move on Jerusalem,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jordan-usa-jerusalem/jordan-begins-diplomatic-offensive-ahead-of-trump-move-on-jerusalem-idUSKBN1DX0OY

Cook shared the data on Sunday during a speech at China’s top public cyber policy forum, organized by the Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC), which oversees internet regulation including censorship.

Earlier this year, Apple said that developers had earned roughly $70 billion in total revenue through the store.

Apple is facing criticism from local users and rights groups for bowing to pressure from Beijing cyber regulators after it decided to remove hundreds of apps from its Chinese store this year, including messaging apps and virtual private network (VPN) services, which help users subvert China’s Great Firewall.

Apple counts China as its third-largest region by sales but it has lost market share in recent years as high-end handsets from local rivals continue to gain traction. The firm is hoping to regain momentum following the release of its iPhone 8 and iPhone X models which shipped in November.

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

Matic, who arrived at Old Trafford from Chelsea at the start of the season, was substituted after 55 minutes of United’s 4-2 win at Watford in mid-week with Mourinho saying the Serbia international had a muscular problem.

The manager remains unsure on whether Matic will be able to make his 15th consecutive league start for United as they continue to chase league leaders Manchester City, who are eight points clear at the top.

“I don’t know if he can play,” Mourinho told a news conference on Friday. “He’s travelling with the team, he’s going to try and hopefully he can, but I cannot guarantee he is ready.”

Mourinho has yet to win an away game against a fellow top six rival since taking charge at Old Trafford, with United’s seven games at Chelsea, Arsenal, City, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur yielding three points and one goal.

When asked if Saturday’s fixture was a must win to keep the title race alive, he replied: ”I tell my players just to think about the game. It doesn’t matter what happened before or what happens afterwards.

”We don’t think about how many points ahead of them we are or how many points ahead the leaders are.

“It will be tough enough against Arsenal so we will focus totally on this game.”

Arsene Wenger’s side, fourth in the league and four points behind second-placed United, have won all their seven league games at home this season, scoring 20 goals and conceding four.

“When we have the ball, we are going to attack with 11 players because even the goalkeeper needs to know what to do when we have the ball,” Mourinho added. “When Arsenal has the ball, we are going to defend with 11 players.”

The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added.

The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N).

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

“(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.",Aetna's board set to approve $68 billion sale to CVS Health: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1DX0NC-OCABS

The ticking clock on the Republican Party’s efforts to cut corporate taxes, alongside the risk that the U.S. government may shut down if a budget deal isn’t reached by December 8, is increasing the levels of political risk for investors - but they have yet to really react.

“Right now the market is assuming that everything will work out, but you’ve got a tremendous number of moving parts,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors (FII.N) in New York.

Alongside the back-and-forth on taxes, Wall Street will be watching a Dec. 8 expiration date for funding needed to keep the U.S. government open alongside the deadline when the U.S. Treasury hits its limit on borrowing; as well as a Dec. 12 Special U.S. Senate election in Alabama.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned on Twitter that “I don’t see a deal” to keep the government open and work past Dec. 8, although the White House said Wednesday it did not see such an eventuality.

Typically, the threat of a government shutdown alone would prompt fund managers to move more of their assets into cash. The benchmark S&P 500 lost 2.6 percent in the eight trading days before the last government shutdown in 2013, and has declined an average of 0.6 percent during government shutdowns overall, according to LPL Financial. Debt limit concerns are likely to be put off until 2018 as the U.S. Treasury is expected to take steps to postpone any need for action by Congress.

Yet with the benchmark S&P 500 up nearly 18 percent for the year to date, some portfolio managers see a greater risk in stepping to the sidelines. Throughout the year, the stock market has rallied in the face of standoffs ranging from increasing tensions in North Korea to former FBI director’s James Comey’s testimony to Congress that President Trump fired him to undermine the agency’s Russia investigation.

On Friday, stocks sold off on a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to tell investigators that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. However, shares quickly pared those losses.

Despite his skepticism, Orlando has yet to move more of his assets to cash, in large part because corporate earnings keep rising and should continue to do so even if a tax package is not signed, he said.

If the tax bill fails, Orlando said he expected the S&P 500 to fall by as much as 10 percent. He would be a buyer in that case, he said, because he expected the S&P 500 to reach 3000 within the next 18 months.

CROWDED CALENDAR

Brian Peery, a portfolio manager at Novato, California-based Hennessy Funds (HNNA.O), said a government shutdown or the tax bill failing would prompt a swift sell-off, but that rising consumer confidence would ultimately continue to push the market higher over the next year.

“If I‘m looking at a 10 percent correction, I‘m a buyer,” he said.

The inaction is not limited to the stock market.

Christopher Ryon, a municipal bond fund manager at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, said that the Republican tax bill could reduce the size of the municipal bond market by 25 to 30 percent by limiting the ability of stadiums, airports and privately-financed toll roads to qualify for tax-exempt status.

At the same time, there could be an increased demand for municipal bonds if residents of high-tax states are no longer able to deduct their full state and local property taxes, leaving tax-free municipal bonds as one of the few ways wealthy investors can reduce their taxable incomes.

As a result, Ryon is largely sitting on his hands, ignoring both lower-rated bonds that have rallied as investors have reached for yield and triple A rated bonds that look “on the rich side,” he said.

“There are a whole lot of unintended consequences attached to this [tax] legislation,” Ryon said. “This is going to be an interesting couple of weeks where we will really see how the sausage gets made.”",Fear of missing out keeps investors in stocks despite risks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/fear-of-missing-out-keeps-investors-in-stocks-despite-risks-idUSKBN1DV5ZH

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/saudi-led-air-strikes-support-yemens-saleh-as-he-shifts-against-houthis-idUSKBN1DX07O

The young, hops-happy economy is alluring for big brewers like Asahi and Anheuser-Busch InBev. Traditional markets are as dull as a flat pint. But entrenched interests, tech-like multiples and the mixed experiences of early entrants should caution them to enjoy responsibly.

Men drink Sabeco's Saigon beer on a roadside restaurant in Hanoi, Vietnam November 29, 217. REUTERS/Kham

Southeast Asia’s fastest growing economy also happens to be one of the last large beer markets to privatise. The country’s brew-friendly culture stands out in comparison with emerging Asian nations like India and Indonesia. In Hanoi, street-side “bia hoi” is common as coffee.

This ticks a lot of boxes for suitors, as the government prepares to sell a majority stake in Sabeco, the market’s largest player worth more than $9 billion. Habeco, the Hanoi rival, should follow. But brewers may wish to wait before clinking glasses.

The opportunity is not news to Big Beer. Heineken has a 5 percent stake in Sabeco, also known as Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp, and Carlsberg has a 17 percent share in Habeco. Both have struggled to win more control and squeeze out rivals. For Heineken, Vietnam is its second most profitable market, but that is thanks to sales of Tiger lager and other brands.

One problem has been delay. The fiscal structure discourages officials from fast-tracking divestment of a tax-paying cash cow. But the bigger issue is price. A phased process has driven up shares in Sabeco so they are trading at three times its December 2016 listing price. It now trades at a gobsmacking 43 times forward earnings.

Multinationals are certainly thirsty for growth. Asian players like Thai Beverage and big Japanese brewers face flattening demand at home. This may explain why Asahi paid AB InBev top dollar for a batch of eastern European labels last year: almost 15 times EBITDA, higher than the 12 to 14 times norm.

The prospect of rivals stepping in is worrying for Heineken and Carlsberg. Either could risk splashing cash to keep competitors out. But Sabeco’s enterprise value is now 38 times EBITDA, according to Eikon data. That’s a big bet on uninterrupted growth.",Breakingviews - Global giants see Vietnam through beer goggles,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-privatisation-breakingviews/breakingviews-global-giants-see-vietnam-through-beer-goggles-idUSKBN1DV3R6

That complicates boss Paul Zwillenberg’s plan to show that Daily Mail and General Trust is more than a struggling publisher.

Full-year results for the financial year to the end of September, released on Thursday, were complex even for the sprawling DMGT, which spans newspapers, data providers, conference organisers and insurance risk management. The group chaired by major shareholder Jonathan Harmsworth, the Viscount Rothermere, reported a 112 million pound pre-tax loss after writing down the value of struggling data subsidiaries. It also flagged a higher future tax rate because of changes to how companies can use historic losses to offset current charges.

But the main culprit behind the 24 percent share-price fall which wiped out 600 million pounds of market value was the revelation that DMGT expects a “mid-single digit” decline in media revenues in the coming financial year. That unit, which includes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and MailOnline website, saw revenue grow by 1 percent to 683 million pounds in the financial year to September – bringing in more than 40 percent of the group total.

The decline is modest compared to the likes of Trinity Mirror, which in October said third-quarter publishing revenue was down 9 percent from a year earlier. For DMGT investors, though, the new guidance is both mysterious and disconcerting. The tough newspaper-advertising market is hardly front-page news. But given that MailOnline is growing, the shrinkage in print ads would have to be unprecedentedly catastrophic to yield a division-wide decline. If the website known for its “sidebar of shame” continues to grow revenue by 20 percent, and smaller operations like Metro stagnated, revenue at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday would have to fall by 12 percent to produce an overall 5 percent drop. That’s possible but implausible, even though the group has no room to raise cover prices after hikes this year.

The logical conclusion is that MailOnline’s growth might also slow, just after it has finally become profitable. Throw in recent troubles for web publishers like Buzzfeed and Vice and it’s no wonder DMGT investors are feeling depressed.",Breakingviews - Daily Mail finally succumbs to media malaise,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-dmgt-outlook-breakingviews/breakingviews-daily-mail-finally-succumbs-to-media-malaise-idUSKBN1DU1PL

Morocco recalled its ambassador from South Africa in 2004 after former South African president Thabo Mbeki recognized a breakaway region in the Western Sahara which Morocco claims as part of its territory.

“Morocco is an African nation and we need to have relations with them,” Zuma told City Press in the interview. “We never had problems with them anyway; they were the first to withdraw diplomatic relations.”

Zuma met Morocco’s King Mohammed last week on the sidelines of an African Union-European Union summit.

“They felt that even if we differ on the Western Sahara issues, the two countries should have a relationship,” Zuma said about Moroccan officials’ position at the meeting.

South Africa’s official government position - as re-affirmed by Zuma in one of his state of the nation addresses - is to support “self determination and decolonization for the Western Sahara”.

The decision to re-establish ties with Morocco is likely to go down badly with some members of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC), of which Zuma is leader.

The ANC - as one of Africa’s oldest liberation movements - has long backed those seeking independence in the Western Sahara and has accused Morocco of occupying the region.

The ruling party said in a statement it had “unequivocal support for Western Sahara” but that this did not mean it harbored enmity toward Morocco.

“There is also no ANC policy that says South Africa should isolate Morocco,” the statement said.

A spokesman for South Africa’s foreign ministry could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion).

The pressure has intensified since French media group Vivendi, TIM’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Shafik, a former air force commander and government minister, was seen as the strongest potential opponent of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is expected to run for a second term next year.

With airport security high, Shafik landed in a private plane in Cairo airport on Saturday evening, the airport sources said.

A Reuters witness at the airport said Egyptian authorities escorted Shafik in a motorcade that was waiting for him outside the airport.

Shafik’s whereabouts are unknown his family said hours after he left the airport, and officials did not issue any statement about his location.

UAE news agency WAM said Shafik left the Emirates, an ally of Sisi’s government, for Egypt without giving any details on why or how he departed. It said his family had remained behind in the Emirates.

Shafik’s daughter May Shafik, told Reuters that authorities had come for him at his home and sent him to Cairo.

“We were about to leave to travel to France. They came and took him. They deported him in a private plane. They said they will deport him to Egypt,” May said.

“Just because he announced he will run for president they deported him to Egypt and I don’t know what will they do to him,” she said.

A Gulf source familiar with the matter said earlier: “Shafik has publicly asked to go to Egypt and his wish will be met.”

Shafik’s lawyer on her Facebook page also said he had been taken from the family home.

UAE AN ALLY OF SISI

A spokesman for Egypt’s foreign ministry did not immediately answer a call seeking details. But an Egyptian judicial source said Shafik was not wanted in any criminal cases at the moment, but he had several cases, including for corruption, against him in the past that either ended in acquittal or were dropped.

“We have no information about a deportation order,” the judicial source said.

Shafik said on Wednesday he would run for president in a surprise announcement from the UAE, where he has been based.

Several other low-profile candidates have said they would run as well.

Shafik narrowly lost to Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt’s 2012 election before fleeing overseas.

May Shafik said on Friday he was preparing to depart, first for Europe and the United States before returning to Egypt to start his campaign.

She said Shafik had been prevented from leaving the UAE in previous days but had then received assurances that he could travel freely. She did not specify who gave the assurances. The UAE denied placing movement restrictions on Shafik.

The UAE has been officially silent on Shafik’s candidacy announcement.

Sisi as a military commander led the ousting of former president Mursi in 2013, before his own landslide election a year later. Sisi’s supporters see him as key to stability following the upheaval that followed the 2011 Egyptian revolt that toppled president Hosni Mubarak.

But his government is fighting a stubborn Islamist militant insurgency in the Sinai region and has also enacted painful austerity reforms over the last year to revive the economy but that critics say have dented his popularity.","Ex Egypt premier Shafik deported from UAE, arrives in Egypt -family, sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DW0IA-OZATP

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh.
HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAEThe Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,https://www.reuters.com/article/yemen-security/saudi-led-air-strikes-support-yemens-saleh-as-he-shifts-against-houthis-idINKBN1DX0JQ?il=0

Coalition aircraft bombed Houthi positions in Sanaa overnight, residents and local media said, aiming to shore up supporters of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh as they battle the Houthi group, which is aligned with Iran.

It was the fourth day of clashes in which dozens have been killed, the Red Cross said.

“There is a plane on stand-by in Djibouti for 140 international staff,” a U.N. official in Sanaa told Reuters. About half were from non-governmental organisations, he said.

“Fighting is moving towards the airport and the situation is very tense. We can’t even evacuate staff,” he said.

United Nations staff have been confined to their living quarters in Sanaa since clashes erupted on Thursday, he said.

Shells were falling near the UN compound in Sanaa on Siteen Street on Sunday, with one source on the scene saying stray bullets had hit the compound. The compound is empty as staff had been told to stay home and not report to work for days.

Another aid worker from an independent agency in Yemen, who declined to be identified, told Reuters: “The U.N. is planning a reduction of staff for U.N. agencies and some NGOs.”

“But more importantly they consider that the road to the airport is not safe enough to organise a movement to the airport,” he said, adding that it might involve evacuation of a total of 180 aid workers.

There was no immediate reply from the United Nations to Reuters queries seeking confirmation of the reports.

Clearance to land at Sanaa airport has yet to be received from the coalition, who control the skies over the Houthi-controlled capital, aid workers said.

The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging America’s friends back into confusion over President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.

The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washington’s leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria.

“Just as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,” said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials.

“It leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump.”

U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue.

European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union.

In addition, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities.

“The chaos in the administration doesn’t help in the current geopolitical climate,” said a senior French diplomat.

Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy.

“The United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad,” he told a think tank.

He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday.

The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.

“If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy – those expectations have been disappointed,” said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats in parliament.

“On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.”

Despite Tillerson’s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.

The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence.

Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis.

Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump’s foreign policy, diplomats said.

“LARGER DOSE OF TRUMP”

There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump.

“We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,” if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.

One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, “so it never left Tillerson much room.”

In addition, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace.

But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later.

Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say.

Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion).

The pressure has intensified since French media group Vivendi, TIM’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

Italy’s communications regulator AGCOM will decide by the middle of next year how to address competition concerns regarding TIM’s network, an AGCOM official said on Nov. 15.

Shafik, a former air force chief and government minister, has been seen by critics of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as a potential challenger to the former military commander who is widely expected to run for a second term next year.

Details about what happened to Shafik are unclear. He made his surprise announcement on Wednesday about running in the 2018 election from UAE where he has been based with his family.

Shafik’s family said he was taken from their home on Saturday by UAE authorities and flown by private plane back to Cairo. A Reuters witness said Egyptian authorities escorted him in a convoy from the airport.

“We know nothing about him since he left home yesterday,” Shafik’s daughter May told Reuters. “If he was deported he should have been able to go home by now, not just disappear. We consider him kidnapped.”

The family and lawyer said they planned to file complaints with the prosecutor’s office around Shafik’s whereabouts. UAE authorities confirmed he left the Emirates but gave no details.

A source at the interior ministry said: “We do not know anything about Shafik. We did not arrest him and we did not receive any requests from the prosecution to arrest him or bring him back.”

GULF ALLIES

Shafik’s abrupt departure from UAE came weeks after Lebanese officials accused Saudi Arabia of meddling by forcing Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to resign by holding him against his will.

Saudi Arabia denied those charges but the case prompted a crisis and pushed Lebanon back into the center of a regional struggle between Riyadh with its Sunni Gulf allies and Iran.

Sisi is an ally of UAE and Saudi Arabia and his supporters say he is key to Egypt’s stability. Critics say he has eroded freedoms gained after a 2011 uprising that ousted former leader Hosni Mubarak and jailed hundreds of dissidents.

Sisi has won backing from Gulf states and has presented himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants since, as army commander, he led the overthrow in 2013 of former president Mohamed Mursi of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood.

Shafik, who narrowly lost a 2012 bid against Mursi, has joined several lower-profile candidates who say they will run, though some believe they have no chance against Sisi.

After four decades in the military, Shafik touted his military experience as one of his strengths in the 2012 vote.

But he fled to the UAE to escape corruption charges in June 2012. He dismissed the charges as politically motivated and was taken off airport watchlists last year.

In UAE, his family said he had round-the-clock security at home and informed authorities about his whereabouts. Soon after his announcement on Wednesday, he claimed he had been blocked. Though his family later said he had been given assurances he could travel.

“Apparently Shafik had to tell the Emiratis about all his moves since he came in 2012 but this time he didn’t for unknown reasons. Maybe he thought they wouldn’t let him leave,” said one diplomat in the region. “That is why he was blocked in the first time.”

But his daughter said he had informed UAE out of courtesy he planned to travel to France.

TARGET AT HOME

Shafik’s second declaration about being unable to travel was made on the Qatar-based Al Jazeera channel, criticized by UAE and Egypt as a mouthpiece for the Muslim Brotherhood, a charge it denies.

His daughter said the video had been leaked to Al Jazeera and had only been made as a precaution. But it triggered a wave of Egyptian pro-government media and talk-show criticism.

State-owned newspapers called Shafik “the fleeing air marshal” and said his lawyer had made deals with outlets sympathetic to the banned Muslim Brotherhood to help with Shafik’s campaign. They provided no evidence.

Two private lawyers filed complaints against Shafik with the public prosecutor in Egypt because of the Al Jazeera broadcast.

One Egyptian judicial source said on Saturday Shafik did not face criminal cases in Egypt. He was acquitted, or had charges dropped, in several cases in the past, including for corruption.

Sisi has yet to announce his own intentions for the election, saying he would follow the will of the people after presenting his achievements in the next two months.

His supporters dismiss criticism over rights abuses and say any measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers.

But his government is struggling to crush the insurgency in the North Sinai region and has also enacted painful austerity reforms over the last year to revive the economy which critics say have eroded his popularity.",Whereabouts of Egyptian ex-PM unknown since deportation home: family,https://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-politics/ex-premiers-whereabouts-unknown-after-return-to-egypt-family-idINKBN1DX08J

Schmidt pleaded guilty in August in the U.S. District Court in Detroit to wrongdoing connected to a massive diesel emissions scandal that has cost Volkswagen as much as $30 billion. He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 6.

“I must say that I feel misused by my own company in the diesel scandal or ‘Dieselgate’,” Schmidt wrote to U.S. judge Sean Cox, according to a copy of the letter published by Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment, citing the ongoing proceedings.

Under a plea agreement, Schmidt faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of between $40,000 and $400,000 after admitting to conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violating clean air laws.

In March, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three felony counts under a plea agreement to resolve U.S. charges it installed secret software in vehicles to evade emissions tests.

U.S. prosecutors have charged eight current and former Volkswagen executives.

Schmidt was in charge of the company’s environmental and engineering office in Auburn Hills, Michigan, until February 2015, where he oversaw emissions issues.

In the letter to the judge, he said he had agreed to follow a script, or talking points, agreed by Volkswagen management and a high-ranking lawyer, at a meeting with Alberto Ayala, a California Air Resources Board executive.

“In hindsight, I should never have agreed to meet with Dr Ayala on that day,” he wrote.

“Or better yet, I should have gone to that meeting and ignored the instructions given to me and told Dr Ayala that there is a defeat device in the VW diesel engine vehicles and that VW had been cheating for almost a decade. I did not do that and that is why I find myself here today.”

After being informed of the existence of the emissions software in the summer of 2015, according to his guilty plea, Schmidt conspired with other executives to avoid disclosing “intentional cheating” by the automaker in a bid to seek regulatory approval for its model 2016 VW 2 liter diesels.","Volkswagen 'misused' me, accused executive tells judge",https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions/volkswagen-misused-me-accused-executive-tells-judge-idINKBN1DX0CV

Marchionne, who is also chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, recognized there was a big opportunity to win new audiences in the United States but said the sport’s heritage had to be respected.

U.S.-based Liberty, who took over the sport in January, are planning to add at least one North American race to the calendar after 2018 and want to build up the show around grand prix weekends.

“I think it’s fair to say that (F1 chairman) Chase (Carey) and I agree we need space in the United States,” Marchionne told reporters at a presentation on Saturday of Alfa Romeo’s new partnership with the Swiss Sauber team.

Carey also attended the event.

”I think there is an opportunity here, if we do the things right, to make this a relevant sport in the U.S. environment. “And if we do that I think it will benefit the sport tremendously,” added Marchionne.

”But I put a big proviso on this.

“We need to be careful that this desire to make us attractive to the American public doesn’t end up sapping away the DNA of a sport that has some noble origins.”

Marchionne highlighted the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin that saw big fight boxing announcer Michael Buffer present drivers to the crowd individually before the race and then make his signature call of “Let’s get ready to rumble”.

Marchionne, who has dual Italian and Canadian citizenship, said the dignity of the sport must be respected.

”I think we need to preserve it, we need to modernize it in a way which Americans find relevant,“ said Marchionne. ”And that’s the tricky part that I think Chase and I need to walk.

“We’re walking a tightrope on this because if we go too far to try and appeal...”

”The performance down in Austin and the way in which we arranged the show was not what I think a Formula One event ought to be. But it was part of a trial and error exercise, I don’t think it worked incredibly well.

“I think a lot of the Europeans were somewhat taken aback by what happened. We need to find a halfway house that somehow appeases and actually enhances the interest of the public on both sides of the pond.”

Marchionne said a threat made last month to take Ferrari out of the sport after 2020, if Formula One made changes that were not in the Italian team’s interests, was real but there was enough time to sort things out.

The New York Times and the Washington Post identified the investigator as FBI agent Peter Strzok, the deputy head of FBI counter-intelligence. He was reassigned last summer to the FBI’s human resources department after the Justice Department’s inspector general began looking into the text messages, the papers said, quoting several unidentified people familiar with the matter.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed the reports Strzok was transferred to the human resources department over the politically charged text messages.

Strzok played a key role in the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the papers said.

During that probe and the 2016 presidential election, Strzok and an FBI colleague exchanged texts that disparaged then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and favored Clinton, his Democratic rival, the Washington Post said. The newspapers did not disclose details of the text messages.

Reuters was unable to reach Strzok for comment. The New York Times said that a lawyer for Strzok declined to comment, while the Washington Post said it repeatedly sought comment from Strzok, but received no response.

Mueller’s office confirmed Strzok’s removal, but did not elaborate on the cause.

“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel’s Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” spokesman Peter Carr said.

In apparent reference to the case, the Justice Department inspector general’s office said in a statement on Saturday that it was “reviewing allegations involving communications between certain individuals.”

The matter came up during a review that the Justice Department launched into the FBI’s decision to announce an inquiry into Clinton’s emails shortly before the November presidential election.

The statement provided no further details and it did not mention any individuals by name. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for further comment.

The FBI was not immediately available for comment.

According to the newspapers, federal law enforcement officials became concerned that Trump and his supporters could use the exposure of the text messages to attack the credibility of Mueller’s investigation.

Mueller, a former FBI director, is looking into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which ran an influence operation aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over Clinton, according to three U.S. intelligence agencies.

Trump has criticized the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, initially citing it as his reason for firing former FBI director James Comey on May 9.

A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East.

Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to “discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern”, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.

“It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and holds a very high risk of provoking Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities in the West,” said the diplomatic source, asking not to be named.

King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.

Word of Trump’s planned announcement, which would deviate from previous U.S. presidents who have insisted the Jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority and was sure to anger the broader Arab world.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel’s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city’s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.

Lo ha detto il presidente del Cds Andrea Moltrasio, che presiede anche la commissione governance, aggiungendo che la direzione in cui si sta andando è quella di un solo consiglio che rappresenta una semplificazione rispetto al sistema dualistico attuale.

“La commissione governance è nella fase conclusiva dei lavori, che sono stati molto intensi e seri. Penso e spero che entro la fine dell‘anno il consiglio approvi le linee guida che stiamo mettendo a punto. C‘è stata un‘interazione come nelle best practice europee con il Cds. Ci sarà ancora qualche altra riunione, una sicuramente, della commissione governance che presiedo e spero entro fine anno di potervi dire qualcosa”, ha detto Moltrasio.

Il presidente dell‘istituto bergamasco ha poi spiegato che l‘iter di approvazione della nuova governance, e quindi delle conseguenti modifiche statutarie, rende “impossibile”che si faccia in tempo per l‘assemblea di bilancio della prossima primavera.

“Probabilmente ne faremo una dedicata dopo, che dal punto di vista sostanziale è meglio. Di corporate governance parlano tutti come della Nazionale di calcio. Sono tutti esperti, tutti selezionatori e tutti sanno. In realtà sono cose moto delicate e sofisticate e quindi è bene che il corpo sociale ne prenda parte in maniera attiva”, ha detto Moltrasio che, a proposito delle recenti dichiarazioni di Giovanni Bazoli, ex consigliere della banca, sul tema ha risposto con una battuta: “Bazoli è uno dei selezionatori della nazionale”.

“La procedura prevede che il Cds approvi le linee guida con indicazioni molto dettagliate che andranno in Cdg, che nel dualistico è l’organo che predispone lo statuto. Lo statuto torna al Cds. Una volta approvato va alle autorità che faranno le loro osservazioni e hanno 90 giorni; dalle autorità torna in banca e se tutto va bene il processo è finito altrimenti faremo le modifiche richieste”, ha poi aggiunto Moltrasio.

Alla domanda se il punto di arrivo sia il sistema monistico, Moltrasio ha risposto che “nel viaggio verso un maggiore efficientamento e una maggiore modernizzazione” compiuto dalla banca con gli ultimi due mandati degli organi sociali “ridurre il lavoro a un solo consiglio è ritenuto una semplificazione”.

Però — ha avvertito Moltrasio —“questo non deve far venir meno il presidio sui controlli e sui rischi che la nostra banca ha avuto durante la crisi e che è in un numero che ritengo fondamentale, che è l‘aumento del tangible equity. Solo noi e Intesa lo abbiamo avuto”.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

Italy’s communications regulator AGCOM will decide by the middle of next year how to address competition concerns regarding TIM’s network, an AGCOM official said on Nov. 15.

There are three options open to the watchdog, the official said, including moving toward imposing a clearer functional separation of the network.",TIM's board to discuss network options this week: source,https://www.reuters.com/article/telecomitalia-network/tims-board-to-discuss-network-options-this-week-source-idINKBN1DX0M8

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.","For the hundreds of thousands of marchers thronging the palace-lined streets of Barcelona on Sunday, there was only one answer to the question about where storied Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, really belonged. “Viva España,” they chanted, waving flags emblazoned with regal lions and banners that read “We are part of Spain!”

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.

The accelerated pace of North Korea’s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.

On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday.

Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.

“It’s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,” the Alabama Congressman and Republican told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California.

When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill‎ said in a statement: “The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.”

The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department.

Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are “competing” for the missile defense installations.

Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites.

The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined.

THAAD is a ground-based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install.

In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed.

A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company “is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.” He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision.

In July, the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The successful test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military’s missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures.

Currently, the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD) in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships. The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD.

The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

North Korea’s latest missile test puts the U.S. capital within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday.",Exclusive: Pentagon evaluating U.S. West Coast missile defense sites - officials,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-westcoast-exclusive/exclusive-pentagon-evaluating-u-s-west-coast-missile-defense-sites-officials-idUSKBN1DX04W

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE.

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said. But they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when.

Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump aides.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump said on Twitter while he was in New York for a fundraising trip. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Flynn, who on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who was Trump’s national security adviser only for 24 days. He was forced to resign after he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak.

“What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for the New York trip. “There’s been absolutely no collusion, so we’re very happy.”

Establishing when Trump was told Flynn lied to the FBI agents could be key to determining if the president acted improperly.

According to a person familiar with the matter, during a conversation between White House counsel Don McGahn and then-acting attorney general Sally Yates in January, Yates told McGahn that Flynn had told FBI agents the same thing he had told Pence.

This was the same conversation reported earlier this year in which Yates told McGahn that Flynn had misled the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and that he might be compromised, the person said.

However, Yates did not give McGahn the impression that the FBI was actively pursuing Flynn for lying, the source said. McGahn did not believe the FBI was investigating Flynn for lying because the bureau had not revoked his security clearance, the person said.

McGahn shared the information from Yates with the president, the person said.

A lawyer for McGahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yates did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Legal experts said if Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI and then pressured then-FBI director James Comey not to investigate him, that would be problematic.

If that were the case Trump’s tweet “absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge,” said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Notre Dame University. “It is evidence of the crucial question of whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent.”

In May, the president fired Comey, who later accused Trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the Russia allegations. Comey also said he believed Trump had asked him to drop the FBI’s probe into Flynn.

Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, said the tweet is open to interpretation and that Trump’s lawyer would downplay its significance.

White House attorney Ty Cobb referred questions about the president’s tweet to Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd, who described it as a “paraphrase” of a statement Cobb had made on Friday reacting to Flynn’s guilty plea.

According to a person familiar with the matter, Dowd composed the tweet.

The tweet is “bizarre and helpful to Mueller and hurtful to the president,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago now at the law firm Thompson Coburn. “It’s one more piece of evidence that helps show the president’s intent when he fired Comey.”

As part of his plea on Friday, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The retired U.S. Army lieutenant general admitted in a Washington court that he lied to FBI investigators about his discussions last December with Kislyak.

In what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, the pair discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia, and Flynn asked Kislyak to help delay a United Nations vote seen as damaging to Israel, according to prosecutors.

Flynn was also told by a “very senior member” of Trump’s transition team to contact Russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the U.N. vote, the prosecutors said.

Sources told Reuters the “very senior” transition official was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Separately, speaking at a defense conference in California on Saturday, Trump’s current national security advisor H.R. McMaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of Flynn, his immediate predecessor, was hurting U.S. national security.

“There’s tremendous confidence, I think there’s more confidence in the United States frankly. I think there’s a sense that we’re re-engaging in areas where we had largely disengaged,” he said.","Trump notes Flynn lied to FBI, says his actions during transition were lawful",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-flynn/trump-notes-flynn-lied-to-fbi-says-his-actions-during-transition-were-lawful-idUSKBN1DW0HK?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Uber’s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who was installed in the top job in August, disclosed the data breach last month shortly after learning of it himself, saying that “none of this should have happened.” Uber’s security practices are also under scrutiny in a high-stakes legal battle with self-driving car company Waymo, an Alphabet Inc subsidiary.

Uber last week said it fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, over his role in the 2016 data breach, which compromised data belonging to 57 million customers and about 600,000 drivers. The resignations Friday came amid mounting frustration within Uber’s security team over Sullivan’s dismissal and the company’s handling of the public disclosure of the breach.

The three managers who resigned were Pooja Ashok, chief of staff for Sullivan; Prithvi Rai, a senior security engineer and the number two manager in the department; and Jeff Jones, who handled physical security, the Uber spokesperson said. Ashok and Jones will remain at the company until January to assist in transition, the spokesperson said.

A fourth individual, Uber’s head of Global Threat Operations, Mat Henley, began a three-month medical leave, said a separate source familiar with the situation. The departures include most of Sullivan’s direct reports.

None of the four immediately responded to requests for comment. Emails in connection with the departures, described by the separate source, complained of emotional and physical strain from the past year.

Sullivan in August told Reuters that his security team totaled around 500 employees.

Leadership in the unit has been in turmoil since the termination last week of Sullivan and a deputy, as well as Uber’s admission that it paid $100,000 to hackers to delete stolen data from the October 2016 breach and keep it secret, while failing to report the incident to regulators or warn customers that their phone numbers and other data had been exposed.

In the Waymo case, testimony at a pretrial hearing this week focused on claims by former employee Richard Jacobs that Uber had a special unit within its security team that tried to obtain programming code and other trade secrets from rivals.

Uber launched an investigation in response to Jacobs’ claims, which were outlined in a 37-page letter sent to Uber’s in-house attorney and the U.S. Department of Justice. Board members received a report before Thanksgiving on the findings of that investigation, run by law firm WilmerHale. The report has not been shared publicly.

Henley, who was among the Uber security managers named in Jacobs’ letter, said in court Wednesday that the unit at Uber that Jacobs had accused of acquiring rivals’ trade secrets no longer exists.

In addition to having a technical team dedicated to obtaining data from competitors, Uber also had a “human intelligence” team to spy on people and record their conversations without them knowing, according to testimony in the Waymo case.

In one instance, a security vendor hired by Uber recorded a conversation between executives of rival ride-hailing firms Didi and Grab, Nicholas Gicinto, a security manager at Uber, testified in court Wednesday.

Uber’s general counsel, Tony West, on Wednesday sent a note to employees, which was seen by Reuters, saying that human surveillance of individuals would no longer be tolerated.

West said he did not believe the activity was illegal, “but, to be crystal clear, to the extent anyone is working on any kind of competitive intelligence project that involves the surveillance of individuals, stop it now.”",Three Uber security managers resign after CEO criticizes practices,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-executives/three-uber-security-managers-resign-after-ceo-criticizes-practices-idUSKBN1DV5SD?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The sources saw that happening even though no detailed agreements are likely to have been made by then on the post-Brexit Irish border, a key outstanding issue after what diplomats in Brussels describe as a breakthrough on the divorce bill London will pay the EU as it leaves.

Instead, a document the EU and Britain are due to sign after British Prime Minister Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the bloc’s executive Commission, meet in Brussels on Monday will spell out both sides’ commitment to sorting out the Irish border conundrum, as well as some rules to follow on that.

“We are all optimistic. The signals we are getting are that we are getting there. There will be more contacts over the weekend,” a senior EU diplomat said.

“Sometimes you think you have it and then things go wrong at the last minute but right now it seems we are almost there. Everyone wants to make it happen now, both we and the Brits.”

Another EU diplomat also said the 27 remaining EU states were willing to give Britain what it had been asking for a long time -- a start to negotiations on a future trade pact -- after the makings emerged of a deal on the “divorce bill”.

The EU and Britain this week agreed on a financial settlement under which London would pay a set share of the bloc’s budgets after it has left.

“Everyone knows we have to honour politically what the Brits have accepted on money,” a second senior EU diplomat said. “So on Monday they will sign this document.”

“And then on Wednesday (27 EU envoys) will say it’s good enough and start working towards ‘sufficient progress’ at the December summit and short guidelines for trade talks.”

The guidelines is a term the 27 EU states use to describe their unified stance on Brexit matters, which they prepare between themselves in advance before engaging with London.

Diplomats have described intense behind-the-scenes talks in recent days, although nothing is yet set in stone.

The other potential spoiler for the Monday document is agreeing on the exact wording on the role of the EU’s top court, the European Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction Britain wants to escape while the bloc insists it is essential.

“It’s not unknown in European Union business for deadlines to slip a bit. Clearly there would be great anxiety on the part of all involved if the situation wasn’t clear by (the end of) next week,” said a fourth EU diplomat.

“But there’s a keen enthusiasm to get it all sorted.”

IRISH BORDER

If things go according to the plan, 27 EU leaders will officially open trade talks with Britain at their final meeting this year in Brussels on Dec. 15.

In a series of steps leading up to that decision, Juncker’s European Commission is also due to give its own view next Wednesday on whether “sufficient progress” has been made in Brexit talks, which started last June.

After that and the Wednesday talks among EU ambassadors in Brussels, the sherpas -- the EU negotiators of the 27 bloc’s leaders -- will also meet to discuss the topic on Dec. 11.

The EU has made covering enough ground on the divorce a precondition to discussing future trade arrangements. Another EU diplomat on Friday stressed the vague concept of “sufficient progress” did not stipulate a comprehensive or exhaustive deal.

Ireland’s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney signalled separately on Friday there was still some time to iron out details on what will become the new EU’s external border before December’s top-level summit.

The chairman of EU leaders meetings, Donald Tusk, visited Dublin on Friday to reassure Ireland of its right to veto any deal it finds unacceptable.

The history of violence on the island of Ireland makes the future border arrangements particularly sensitive.

Both sides’ desire to avoid putting physical border infrastructure on the island is complicated by the fact that Britain will be leaving the EU’s single market and customs zone.

For its part, Britain says the border deal cannot erect new divisions within the country. May’s government also depends on the backing of Northern Ireland’s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which has hinted at limits to concessions to Dublin.

One of the sources stressed the “basic concept of no regulatory divergence” between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland was crucial for the bloc to have in the Monday document, while another said it would have to be quite specific on what sort of money London will pay on leaving.",EU could give the nod next week to trade talks with Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-progress/eu-could-give-the-nod-next-week-to-trade-talks-with-britain-idUKKBN1DV60P

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

As Freeport-McMoRan hammers out terms for handing over a majority stake in the Grasberg copper mine to Jakarta, a production arrangement dating back to 1995 gives its Anglo-Australian partner an effective veto. The best way to play this sleeved ace would be to negotiate a graceful exit.

U.S.-based Freeport agreed in August to give 51 percent of the mine in remote Papua, which has been plagued by separatist violence and royalty disputes, to Indonesia. Since the announcement, there has been little evidence of progress.

Lurking in the background is Rio. The $90 billion company could object to any transaction that affects its claim on production, and potentially stall the proceedings. Indonesia probably wants to avoid that scenario.

If presented with a buyout offer, Rio would have a tough decision to make. Grasberg is the world’s second-largest copper mine and a fresh pact with Indonesia brings some stability. There are probably better ways to allocate capital, however.

The company led by Jean-Sébastien Jacques has managed to avoid financial disaster despite strikes and shootings that have prevented Rio from receiving any copper since 2014. A $1.3 billion investment more than two decades ago gave Rio shares in Freeport. It sold those at a profit, but retained a share of Grasberg output: 40 percent of production over a level that varies. It gets to claim more in a few years.

A review of two decades of annual reports, however, reveals the opportunity cost. Rio’s capital expenditures on Grasberg tally nearly $2 billion, while net profit adds up to just $1.7 billion. A recent stretch has been particularly painful. More than $850 million invested between 2012 and 2016 was accompanied by losses of about $150 million. And capital commitments will rise with planned expansion.

That suggests it’s time to focus elsewhere. Rio has approved the next phase of Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, a project it controls, with a projected internal rate of return of over 20 percent.

The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging America’s friends back into confusion over President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.

The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washington’s leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria.

“Just as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,” said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials.

“It leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump.”

U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue.

European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union.

In addition, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities.

“The chaos in the administration doesn’t help in the current geopolitical climate,” said a senior French diplomat.

Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy.

“The United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad,” he told a think tank.

He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday.

The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.

“If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy – those expectations have been disappointed,” said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats in parliament.

“On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.”

Despite Tillerson’s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.

The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence.

Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis.

Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump’s foreign policy, diplomats said.

“LARGER DOSE OF TRUMP”

There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump.

“We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,” if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.

One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, “so it never left Tillerson much room.”

In addition, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace.

But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later.

Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say.

Fisher had filmed all of her scenes for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the eighth installment of the blockbuster space saga, before she died of a heart attack in December 2016.

“She’s irreplaceable,” Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, told Reuters. “‘Star Wars’ is about great triumphs and great tragedies, and I can’t think of a bigger tragedy than missing our Leia,” Hamill told Reuters.

Writer and director Rian Johnson said he did not change Leia’s story in “Last Jedi” after her death. The film debuts in theaters December 14.

It will be up to the makers of 2019 film “Episode IX” to decide the ultimate fate of the character first seen as a spunky princess in the original 1977 “Star Wars” film, Johnson added.

In “The Last Jedi,” “we didn’t tailor it to be a farewell to her,” Johnson said. “But, that having been said, I think there’s some moments that I think will really mean a lot to fans. You will see more from Leia that you haven’t seen before.”

Fisher’s final film appearance is expected to boost already feverish interest in the franchise, now owned by Walt Disney Co. Boxoffice.com projects “Last Jedi” will haul in $185 million to $215 million at U.S. and Canadian ticket windows its first weekend, which would rank as one of the biggest film debuts in history.

The cast and director provided few details about the film’s plot. John Boyega, who portrays former Stormtrooper Finn, said the movie finds Leia, now a general, leading the Resistance against the evil First Order during a tense time in the raging battle to protect the galaxy far, far away.

“There is a lot of pressure on the Resistance, and General Leia is on the front lines having to make big decisions,” Boyega said. “It’s a performance that requires a heartfelt approach, and she definitely had that.”

Oscar Isaac, who plays Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, said the time in Leia’s life mirrored Fisher’s in some ways.

Leia understands “she’s not going to be around forever, and there is a passing of the torch that needs to happen,” Isaac said. “She wants to give over as much of her wisdom as she can before this moment happens.”

Fisher, however, would not want fans to get too sentimental, Hamill said.

“I do know her well enough to say that she would want us to be laughing and even mocking her,” Hamill said.

“She was irreverent, she was cynical, and she was bitterly funny and caustic and all these things. But she was always fun to be around,” he added.",Leia leads resistance in Carrie Fisher's final 'Star Wars' film,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-film-starwars-fisher/leia-leads-resistance-in-carrie-fishers-final-star-wars-film-idUKKBN1DX02L

The umbrella organization for the world’s central banks gave the warning as investors continue to bask in what it called the “light and warmth” of improving global growth, subdued inflation and soaring stock markets.

Record high debt levels, however, highlight vulnerabilities in the financial system and the scale of this year’s rally in asset prices seems to have increased caution at the Switzerland-based BIS.

“High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy (asset price) valuations,” the head of BIS’s monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said.

“The longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence.”

There was some surprise too that benchmark bond yields - which drive global borrowing costs - have stayed down even with the Federal Reserve now shrinking its balance sheet and the European Central Bank also about to heavily cut its stimulus.

The improving global growth outlook, Japan’s ongoing money printing and the message from both the Fed and ECB that they will tread carefully going forward was the likely explanation for still low yields, though they did raise a “deeper question”.

“Can a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions unambiguously ease? And, if the answer is no, what should central banks do?” Borio said.

The pace of tightening from the likes of the Fed is already expected to be the slowest on record.

One concern is that the continued low bond yields and low market volatility, particularly in the United States, are reminiscent of the bond market “conundrum” referred to by former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in 2005 before the financial crisis.

Yields remained low then too despite a run of U.S. rate hikes and only gained any traction later in the cycle.

“In an era in which gradualism and predictability are becoming the norm, these questions (about effective tightening) are likely to grow more pressing.”

It is especially the case with some stock market gauges now in “frothy” territory.

At recent levels in excess of 30, the U.S. stock market’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), for example, has exceeded its post-1982 average by almost 25 percent.

The dividend payout ratio of U.S. companies is also back at highs observed in the 1970s and so might not go much further. “High valuations: market complacency?” the BIS posed the question, though it said stocks did look much less frothy when measured against extremely low bonds yields.

The multibillion-dollar case, in which Waymo has accused Uber of stealing confidential information about its self-driving car designs, has hobbled Uber’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. It is the highest-stakes legal challenge on a lengthy list of litigation that Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, inherited when he joined the company in August.

Tuesday’s hearing centered on a 37-page letter from a lawyer for former Uber security analyst Richard Jacobs, which Uber did not show Waymo as both sides prepared their cases. The letter turned up last week when U.S. District Judge William Alsup was informed of it by the U.S. Department of Justice, days before the trial was set to begin. The discovery led Alsup to issue a new order for Uber to compel Jacobs to appear in court.

Uber’s not turning over the letter months ago when the company was asked to gather such documents raised the judge’s ire, setting up one of the most heated hearings in the case to date.

“I can’t trust anything you say because it’s been proven wrong so many times,” Alsup told Uber at the hearing. “You’re just making the impression that this is a total cover-up.”

Alsup agreed to Waymo’s request to delay the jury trial scheduled for next week, saying in federal court in San Francisco that “if even half of what this letter says is true it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial” as planned.

It was the second time the judge has agreed to delay a trial at Waymo’s request. In October, he chided Uber lawyers for disclosing thousands of emails to Waymo just before the trial had been set to begin..

Jacobs, who was fired from his job at Uber in April but still works for the company as a consultant, testified on Tuesday about the contents of the letter. The letter said an organization within Uber called marketplace analytics “exists expressly for the purpose for acquiring trade secrets, code base and competitive intelligence.”

In his testimony, Jacobs described an elaborate intelligence operation inside Uber to deliberately research competitors and gather data about them, and use technology to avoid a paper trail.

“I did not believe it was patently legal,” Jacobs said. “I had questions about the ethics of it.”

Uber employees involved in researching rivals were given training with the purpose to “impede, obstruct or influence any lawsuit against Uber,” Jacobs said, including a communication strategy to ensure Uber did not create a paper trail that could come back to haunt the company in any “anticipated litigation.”

The strategy included using ephemeral messaging apps such as Wickr and laptops and wireless internet devices that could not be traced back to the user, Jacobs said. Some Uber employees also used separate servers from the rest of the business, he said, and invented attorney-client privileges to keep communications secret. Uber also relied on as many as 10 outside security vendors.

Jacobs said he learned of this activity primarily through discussions at Uber involving his manager and other colleagues.

Jacobs, however, disagreed with a portion of the letter his attorney had written on his behalf that asserted a team of Uber employees stole trade secrets from Waymo.

“None of the testimony today changes the merits of the case. Jacobs himself said on the stand today that he was not aware of any Waymo trade secrets being stolen,” an Uber spokeswoman said.

Another former Uber security analyst, Ed Russo, testified Tuesday and rebuffed Jacobs’ claims that he was a key figure in Uber’s effort to recruit insiders at competitors to steal confidential information and instruct Uber staff to keep their communications covert.

“It’s never been our role or my role to engage in the theft of trade secrets,” Russo said. “That’s false.”

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets. Levandowski has declined to answer questions about the allegations, citing constitutional protections against self-incrimination. Uber has since fired him.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion and wants to curtail Uber’s self-driving car program, which Waymo says uses its technology. Uber rejects the financial damages claim.

A new date for the trial has not yet been set, but the hearing will resume Wednesday with testimony from Uber’s in-house lawyer, Angela Padilla. Jacobs last May sent Padilla a letter outlining his concerns about Uber’s behavior similar to the letter obtained from the Justice Department.

Waymo has accused Uber of concealing Jacobs’ letter with Padilla.

Jacobs said that he believed Uber fired him because he objected to its practices. After his termination, he and Uber reached a $4.5 million settlement. He has been paid $2 million and will receive another $1 million at the end of his consulting contract, he said. Jacobs received another $1.5 million in Uber stock.

Uber attorneys characterized Jacobs’ letter as an ex-employee seeking money.

“There is not one bit of admissible jury evidence from that witness,” said Arturo Gonzalez of Morrison Foerster.

The ride-hailing service is the most valuable private U.S. company, but its aggressive expansion has been dogged by scandals.

The company revealed last week that the data of 57 million Uber customers and 600,000 drivers had been stolen in a breach more than a year ago, and that Uber had paid two hackers $100,000 to cover it up. Governments across the globe have launched investigations into the incident, and the Illinois Cook County prosecutor and Washington state attorney general have filed lawsuits against Uber for failing to comply with data breach notification laws.",Uber-Waymo trial delayed as U.S. judge raises prospect of 'cover-up',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-ruling/uber-waymo-trial-delayed-as-u-s-judge-raises-prospect-of-cover-up-idUSKBN1DS26X

The latest blow: Angela Merkel’s struggle to keep control of the government after her struggle to cobble together a new ruling coalition collapsed last weekend.

Merkel, a leader of apparent modesty and inexhaustible good sense, now must choose between another exhausting round of coalition negotiations, a minority government or fresh elections.

Meanwhile, Britain is leaving the European Union, and the vast task of disentangling nearly 45 years of unity at times seems beyond the UK’s weak Conservative government. But the people spoke in a referendum on Brexit, and no one can grab the wheel and turn the country around. Italy’s right, revived by gains in regional and local elections and leaning heavily towards the right, even far right and euro skepticism, is now the favorite to win a general election early next year.

Spain dismissed the government of Catalonia and rules it directly because the region – Spain’s richest – voted for independence in an unconstitutional referendum. Ironically, Madrid’s action will likely increase that very support for independence. In Poland, an increasingly authoritarian government headed by the Law and Justice Party now trades barbs daily with the EU – the latest salvo coming from European Council President Donald Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland.

And that’s just the larger countries. In the ranks of the middle and small members of the EU, matters are as bad — worse, in some cases. Belgium, according to some of its ministers, will cease to exist in less than a decade, split between the now largely autonomous Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Walloon (French-speaking) regions. Hungary, with the ruling Fidesz party buoyed by its adamant opposition to taking immigrants, now defies a European Court ruling that it must do so.

In Austria, coalition talks between the Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz and the far-right Freedom Party in Austria got off to a “very good start” last month. If they succeed, Kurz’s People’s Party and the Freedom Party will form a bloc hostile to immigration and skeptical of Brussels, certain to press for powers to return to the members’ capitals.

Parties in the Netherlands took seven months to cobble together a coalition which gives it a one-vote majority in parliament, and which is widely expected to fall apart in the next few months. In the Czech Republic – another member state which has refused to take in migrants – coalition talks got nowhere after the election last month, and the leader of the winning ANO party, Andrej Babis, has said he will form a minority government. Babis himself faces fraud charges over a 2 million euro ($2.36 million) EU subsidy, and any minority government is expected to bring political turmoil and no agreement on a budget.

To count a couple more ways, President Donald Trump, regarded everywhere in Europe as an unstoppably loose cannon, likes the EU no better than he ever did, and thus will not help countries accustomed to being called the United States’ closest allies; they must learn to fend for themselves. The EU’s hostility to Russia – amply reciprocated, boosted by the seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea and continued sponsorship of the anti-government rebels in the eastern Donbas area – remains an untreated, and apparently untreatable, sore.

And thus to Germany, the moderate port in the storm of turbulence, led by a woman lauded at home and respected abroad. But this week in Germany, the popular tabloid Bild is screaming from the newsstands – “How long can Merkel Stay in Power?” The centrist paper of record, the Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung, ran an incendiary interview with the leader of the socially liberal Free Democratic Party Christian Lindner – which walked out of the coalition talks on Monday.

Merkel’s conservative CDU-CSU coalition won the most parliamentary seats in the September elections, but its heavy loss of support from its previous numbers forces it to seek unlikely coalition partners. The social democratic SPD, itself greatly reduced, saw continuing a coalition with Merkel as a recipe for more decline – although it now says it will return if its members give their consent. Merkel has tried, in past weeks, to cobble together a government with the pro-business FDP and the leftish Greens, both of which increased their vote substantially in the national vote. The weekend breakdown threw the country’s politics into crisis; everywhere in Europe, the leading state’s floundering was seen as more poisonous to the union than any of the other ills now besetting it.

European nerves may be over-strained. A case can be made that German politics need a shake-up, and that a second election – Merkel’s preferred alternative if SPD members reject another coalition – will produce a renewed polity.

It may. It may also produce – and this is the fear of liberal Germans, left and right – a stronger Alternativ fur Deutschland, the far-right party which surged from no representation in the Bundestag to the country’s third-largest party. It is violently against immigration, and in the election campaign marked that most powerfully with a poster showing a white, heavily pregnant German woman with the slogan – “New Germans? We make them ourselves!”

With such divisions, Germany does not just face a season of choppy politics; it threatens to head out of the zone which its politics have occupied for most of the post-war period. That is, an agreement that the center will hold, and that anti-fascism is an attitude shared by all, part of the fabric of German society, its re-entry into the democratic world.

It points to something else too. The European Union, in its negotiations with the UK on Brexit, presents itself as a united bloc of 27 dealing, reluctantly and severely, with an errant 28th. In fact, it is a Union in urgent need of frank talking, of confrontation with its own inner and outer weaknesses and challenges, and evident incapacity to move to a more closely integrated bloc, let alone a federation.

The present decline of Germany may be brief, since the country remains the most successful economy in Europe, and one of the best governed. Merkel remains the most popular politician, and her reputation for rational, careful government is well deserved. She has promised the EU that Germany continues to have a government committed to the union.

But the latest developments should prompt reflection and action. If the ever-closer union is a chimera, what form of union is sensible for the 21st century? And when one can be imagined, and agreed, a new framework for a diverse Europe, no longer straining after a presently impossible dream, should be brought into being.",Commentary: What Merkel’s political woes mean for the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-germany-commentary/commentary-what-merkels-political-woes-mean-for-the-eu-idUSKBN1DO24W

The poll, published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, found 50 percent of people supported another vote on the final terms of Britain’s exit deal, 34 percent rejected another referendum and 16 percent said they did not know.

The newspaper said it was the first major opinion poll since last week’s media reports that Britain is preparing to pay about 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to help to pave the way for talks on a future trade pact with the EU.

Since the referendum in 2016, high profile opponents of Britain’s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron, to former British prime minister Tony Blair and billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous for the British economy.

Blair told the BBC on Sunday that Britain could change its mind about leaving the EU.

“It’s reversible. It’s not done until it’s done,” he said.

It’s still unclear who will end up running Zimbabwe. But whoever prevails will need the backing of both the military as well as China, Zimbabwe’s primary foreign investor.

By Thursday, reports indicated the 93-year-old Mugabe was still trying to persuade top generals that he should be allowed to serve out his presidential term until elections next year. The generals were believed to favor handing power to Mugabe’s former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Here are some key lessons from what we now know:

1. China is emerging as a key powerbroker on the continent.

Nobody in Beijing or Harare is saying whether China was told in advance about plans for the takeover. Shortly before Zimbabwean tanks took to the streets, however, the Chinese Defense Ministry made a point of reporting that Zimbabwe’s top military commander had met with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing the previous week.

The news was widely reported, particularly in southern Africa, alongside the breaking coup developments. Many regional observers suspect China, which backed guerrilla fighters from Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union movement during its war against then-Rhodesia’s white minority regime, was in the loop on events in Harare, and broadly supportive.

With Beijing strikingly increasing its holdings in sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade, expect this kind of signaling to be a key part of events on the continent from now on.

2. No autocrat lasts forever.

Described by a U.S. ambassador as a “brilliant tactician,” Mugabe was regarded as one of the great survivors of international politics. Charming and utterly ruthless, he was willing to use ethnic division, death squads, media manipulation and a host of other unsavory tools to crush all opponents. In 2008, his main rival withdrew from a runoff vote after government forces beat, killed or intimidated thousands of opposition voters.

Ironically, he’s now been undone by the same advancing years that once protected him from internal challengers who previously seemed content to wait for time to take its toll. Since he entered his 90s, this dynamic changed as it became clearer that Grace Mugabe, an ambitious woman more than 30 years her husband’s junior, was angling for her own shot at the presidency. The scheming and backstabbing culminated last week in the firing of Vice President Mnangagwa – a onetime favorite as Mugabe’s successor – in what was seen as a move to strengthen Grace Mugabe.

3. “Keeping it in the family” isn’t always possible.

President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace Mugabe at a rally of his ruling ZANU-PF party in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 8, 2017.REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo

Trying to transfer power to a close family member is hardly an unusual strategy for an ailing potentate. In countries that are not constitutional monarchies, however, it can be a divisive or impossible process.

Dubbed “Gucci Grace” within Zimbabwe for her reported shopping habits, Mugabe’s wife was never popular. Perhaps more importantly, her growing influence alienated and upset established figures in the ruling Zanu-PF party and government structure. They were clearly beginning to move against her before last week’s ouster of Mnangagwa.

Nor are the Mugabes the only dominant family in Africa to have had a bad week. Earlier this year, Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos handed power to his deputy after 37 years in office as part of the deal that also put his daughter Isabel in charge of state oil firm Sonangol. It lasted less than three months – she was fired on Wednesday in a move analysts said was a clear attempt by new incumbent João Lourenço to trim family power.

4. Entrenched power structures are just that. Entrenched.

When he was ousted from office last week, it briefly looked like the end of the road for Mnangagwa. Now, the man sometimes nicknamed the “Crocodile” looks likely to be handed power by the actions of the Army.

This is not a uniquely Zimbabwean situation. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is in many respects a similar character, a senior Army official who projected himself as a safe pair of hands through the chaos that followed the ouster of Hosni Mubarak and his sons.

These individuals are not just bright, ambitious characters who have waited in the wings for decades. They also have access to an entire generation of similar figures with similar frustrations. That can make for a powerful network when it comes to this kind of situation and a need for sudden, decisive action.

5. Imagery and narrative are crucial.

The speed and success of the military takeover in Zimbabwe contrasts dramatically with the July 2016 attempted coup in Turkey. Then, a relatively small group of military officers attempted to move against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Taking on a leader who was at the peak of his powers rather than an ailing nonagenarian, they faced a tougher task than their Zimbabwean counterparts. But the Turkish plotters also failed to seize key government buildings and allowed Erdogan to address the nation and coordinate with still-loyal military units.

In Zimbabwe, the military appears to have been united. Little force was used – and in at least one case, a poorly-maintained tank was unable to make it to the capital. None of that particularly mattered. The speed with which Mugabe was contained, the television appearance of a military spokesman and the visible presence of armored vehicles on streets was enough to show that the political reality had changed.

Whoever takes over in Zimbabwe now will need the backing of the military, but that doesn’t mean those behind the seizure of power can expect a free rein.

“We were looking at a total of 550, it was pretty close to that. So we thought we might as well declare,” India bowling coach Bharat Arun said, dismissing suggestions it was a forced declaration.

Until then, the stadium’s near-capacity crowd was treated to some elegant shot-making by Kohli, who hit 25 crisp boundaries in his master class spread over seven-and-half hours.

The 29-year-old became the first international captain to score six double centuries, all of them coming in the last 17 months.

His latest looked a mere formality after India, chasing a record-equalling ninth consecutive test series victory, resumed on 371-4.

“His absolute focus, attention to details, in terms of fitness, game preparation, his skills, he’s spot on,” Arun said.

“He’s an example of what you need to be as a cricketer. That shows in his success rate.”

By Katanga Johnson and Makini Brice

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Charles “Chuck” Johnson is not the kind of foot soldier in the army of lobbyists that House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan warned would descend on Washington to fight the biggest overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s.

Johnson, 53, with a degree in social work and another from a theological seminary, heads the National Council for Adoption, a small organization in Alexandria, Virginia that represents adoption agencies and adoption lawyers. Despite a relative lack of clout, parents of adopted children and adoption advocates beat back a minor change in the tax code that would have removed a tax credit to help cover the costs of adoption.

Politics in Washington favors the moneyed and the connected, especially Big Business and special interest groups rich enough to employ legions of lobbyists to advocate on their behalf.

But many of the taxpayers affected by President Donald Trump’s tax overhaul have little or no influence on Congress, where Republicans are looking to end a host of tax credits and deductions for medical expenses, moving expenses and alimony in order to pay for their big tax cuts. The bill will cut corporate tax, provide a tax holiday for corporations’ overseas profits and cut the tax rate for the wealthy.

“Everyone in corporate America had an army ready and in place to push for simplifying the tax code,” said Michaela Sims Stewart, president of the lobbying firm Sims Strategies.

In contrast, parents of adopted children “naturally came together” to form a “small but mighty group,” said Stewart.

Stewart also happens to be a spokeswoman for Adoption Tax Credit Working Group, which brought together a host of organizations, some with strong Republican and conservative ties, to pressure the House leadership to drop the change.

Part of the tax code since 1998, the adoption tax credit was used by nearly 74,000 people in 2014, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

FILE PHOTO: Graduate students and others rally against the proposed GOP tax reform bill at Union Square in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 29, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo

The adoption advocates started a social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter to alert parents of the change. ”We expected adoptive families to rally in support, but when groups like Focus on the Family, National Right to Life, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, prominent clergy such as Russell Moore, and even the LGBT community joined, the media took an interest,” said Johnson, of the National Council for Adoption.

With the publicity, pro-family Republican politicians were suddenly in the position of having to explain the elimination of what the coalition had successfully cast as a pro-child policy.

The House proposal was dropped Nov. 2 and the Senate didn’t even bother to make it part of its version of the tax bill.

STUDENTS PROTEST

While adoptive parents were ultimately successful in their fight, others have struggled to be heard.

Graduate students staged walkouts on dozens of campuses this week to protest one Republican proposal that would increase their tax burden. It would require graduate students to pay taxes on tuition payments that are waived by their university as if it were income. In other words, the students would be required to pay taxes on money they never had to begin with.

Few of the Republican proposals to end deductions or tax credits will yield a lot of money for a government that spends $4 trillion a year. Ending alimony deductions, a benefit in the tax code since 1954, might raise $8.3 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation.

No longer letting teachers write off $250 of what they shell out of their own pocket for classroom supplies might yield $2.1 billion over the same period, the committee says. The change affecting adoption might bring in less than $50 million over the next decade. The committee did not break out what ending medical deductions would yield.

Even though the stakes are high for them, advocates for people with disabilities and chronic diseases say they lagged in fighting cuts in medical expense deductibility, as well as removing a tax break to companies that make handicap-accessible structural changes, and a tax credit for businesses that hire people with disabilities. The tax breaks were not explicitly for people with disabilities, and the advocates had not expected they would be in Congress’s crosshairs.

These less-than-powerful voices may yet be heard as the Senate prepares to vote on its bill this week. They may get another chance when the House and Senate compromise on a single piece of legislation to vote on and pass to Trump.",How parents of adopted children foiled a U.S. Republican tax proposal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-tax-powerless/how-parents-of-adopted-children-foiled-a-u-s-republican-tax-proposal-idUSKBN1DU33L

The New York Times and the Washington Post identified the investigator as FBI agent Peter Strzok, the deputy head of FBI counter-intelligence. He was reassigned last summer to the FBI’s human resources department after the Justice Department’s inspector general began looking into the text messages, the papers said, quoting several unidentified people familiar with the matter.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed the reports Strzok was transferred to the human resources department over the politically charged text messages.

Strzok played a key role in the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the papers said.

During that probe and the 2016 presidential election, Strzok and an FBI colleague exchanged texts that disparaged then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and favored Clinton, his Democratic rival, the Washington Post said. The newspapers did not disclose details of the text messages.

Reuters was unable to reach Strzok for comment. The New York Times said that a lawyer for Strzok declined to comment, while the Washington Post said it repeatedly sought comment from Strzok, but received no response.

Mueller’s office confirmed Strzok’s removal, but did not elaborate on the cause.

“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel’s Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” spokesman Peter Carr said.

In apparent reference to the case, the Justice Department inspector general’s office said in a statement on Saturday that it was “reviewing allegations involving communications between certain individuals.”

The matter came up during a review that the Justice Department launched into the FBI’s decision to announce an inquiry into Clinton’s emails shortly before the November presidential election.

The statement provided no further details and it did not mention any individuals by name. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for further comment.

The FBI was not immediately available for comment.

According to the newspapers, federal law enforcement officials became concerned that Trump and his supporters could use the exposure of the text messages to attack the credibility of Mueller’s investigation.

Mueller, a former FBI director, is looking into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which ran an influence operation aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over Clinton, according to three U.S. intelligence agencies.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging America’s friends back into confusion over President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.

The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washington’s leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria.

“Just as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,” said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials.

“It leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump.”

U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue.

European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union.

In addition, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities.

“The chaos in the administration doesn’t help in the current geopolitical climate,” said a senior French diplomat.

Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy.

“The United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad,” he told a think tank.

He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday.

The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.

“If there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy – those expectations have been disappointed,” said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats in parliament.

“On his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.”

Despite Tillerson’s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.

The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence.

Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis.

Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump’s foreign policy, diplomats said.

“LARGER DOSE OF TRUMP”

There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump.

“We may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,” if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.

One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, “so it never left Tillerson much room.”

In addition, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace.

But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later.

Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say.

Der Senat billigte am frühen Samstag nach langen Verhandlungen den Gesetzentwurf von Trumps Republikanern. Dieser sieht Steuersenkungen für Firmen und Reiche vor. Für Normalverdiener ergeben die geplanten Veränderungen ein gemischtes Bild. Nun müssen Senat und Repräsentantenhaus, das bereits eine eigene Gesetzvorlage verabschiedet hat, ihre Entwürfe abgleichen, so dass die Reform mit Trumps Unterschrift Gesetz werden kann. Das soll nach dem Willen des Präsidenten noch vor dem Jahresende geschehen. Die Gespräche zwischen beiden Kongresskammern dürften in der neuen Woche beginnen.

Ein Erfolg ist für Trump wichtig, weil er mit dem größten Umbau des Steuersystems seit den 80er Jahren ein zentrales Wahlversprechen einlösen würde. Das Projekt soll der bereits deutlich wachsenden US-Wirtschaft nachhaltig Schwung verleihen. Zudem würde Trump damit sein erstes großes Gesetzesvorhaben überhaupt durchbringen. Im November 2018 finden Kongresswahlen statt. Dabei werden das gesamte Repräsentantenhaus und ein Drittel des Senats gewählt. Auch an den Finanzmärkten sind die Erwartungen hoch. Die Aussicht auf kräftige Entlastungen für Firmen hat die US-Börsen auf Rekordstände getrieben. Die Unternehmensteuer soll dauerhaft auf 20 Prozent von bislang 35 Prozent verringert werden. Außerdem sollen US-Gesellschaften dazu gebracht werden, ihre im Ausland erzielten Gewinne in der Heimat zu investieren, indem die Rückführung dieses Geldes von der Besteuerung weitgehend ausgenommen wird.

Die deutsche Wirtschaft sieht in den Plänen eine ernsthafte Bedrohung, wie der Industrieverband BDI deutlich machte. Diese bedeuteten eine Verschärfung des Steuerwettbewerbs und hätten “klar protektionistischen Charakter” zum Nachteil europäischer Firmen. “Jede neue Bundesregierung muss schnellstmöglich strukturelle Verbesserungen im Unternehmensteuerrecht auf den Weg bringen.”

ENTLASTUNG DER MITTELSCHICHT ODER GESCHENK FÜR REICHE?

Trump feierte die Senatszustimmung als bedeutenden Etappensieg. “Wir sind einen Schritt näher an massiven Steuersenkungen für arbeitende Familien in ganz Amerika”, erklärte er auf Twitter. Der Mehrheitsführer der Republikaner im Senat, Mitch McConnell, sagte: “Wir sind jetzt in der Lage, Amerika wettbewerbsfähiger zu machen, Arbeitsplätze vor der Verlagerung ins Ausland zu schützen und die Mittelschicht substanziell zu entlasten.” Demokraten sprachen dagegen von Geschenken für Unternehmen und Wohlhabende, die mit neuen Milliardenschulden erkauft würden. Die Planungen der Republikaner laufen darauf hinaus, dass der US-Schuldenberg von 20 Billionen Dollar binnen zehn Jahren um 1,4 Billionen höher wird.

Die Entscheidung im Senat fiel mit 51 zu 49 Stimmen knapp aus. Alle Demokraten votierten dagegen. Von den 52 Republikanern schlug sich einer auf die Seite der Opposition: Bob Corker wollte nach eigenen Worten die Aufblähung des Haushaltsdefizits auf Kosten künftiger Generationen nicht mitverantworten.

IN LETZTER MINUTE AUF LINIE GEBRACHT

Sechs weitere Senatoren der Republikaner, deren Zustimmung ebenfalls in Zweifel stand, wurden mit einer Vielzahl von Ergänzungen der Gesetzesvorlage in letzter Minute auf Linie gebracht. Die Gespräche darüber zögerten die Abstimmung bis in die frühen Morgenstunden hinaus. Die Demokraten kritisierten, die Zusätze seien hastig entworfen und böten Steueranwälten und -beratern neue Schlupflöcher, um das Geld ihrer Mandanten dem Fiskus vorzuenthalten. “Die Republikaner haben es geschafft, ein schlechtes Gesetz noch schlechter zu machen”, sagte der ranghöchste Demokrat im Senat, Chuck Schumer.

Zwei republikanische Senatoren kündigten ihre Unterstützung für den Entwurf erst an, nachdem sie stärkere Entlastungen für Kleinbetriebe durchsetzen konnten, die als sogenannte “Pass-through”-Gesellschaften firmieren. Der demokratische Senator Richard Blumenthal sagte, der Milliardär Trump kontrolliere mehr als 500 solcher Firmen und werde direkt von der Änderung profitieren. “Daher dürfte der Präsident in Feierstimmung sein, aber die meisten Amerikaner werden diesen Tag bereuen.”

Die Steuervorlage des Senats sieht auch einen teilweisen Rückbau der Gesundheitsreform Obamacare von Trumps Vorgänger Barack Obama vor. Konkret geht es darum, eine Strafe abzuschaffen, die anfällt, wenn Bürger sich der Krankenversicherungspflicht widersetzen. Kritikern zufolge würde die Rücknahme der Pflicht dazu führen, dass die Versicherungskosten für Alte und Kranke aus dem Ruder laufen. Gemäßigte Republikaner hatten entscheidend dazu beigetragen, dass Trump die im Wahlkampf zugesagte Abschaffung von Obamacare nicht gelang. Eine von ihnen ist Senatorin Susan Collins. Sie stimmte nun doch für das Steuergesetz. Sie habe Zusicherungen bekommen, dass die Nachteile durch den Rückbau der Gesundheitsreform in späteren Gesetzen verringert werden sollen, sagte Collins.

The individual mandate is meant to ensure a viable health insurance market by forcing younger and healthier Americans to buy coverage to help offset the cost of sicker patients. It helps uphold the most popular provision of the law, which requires insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates.

Removing it while keeping the rest of Obama’s Affordable Care Act intact is expected to cause insurance premiums to rise and lead to millions of people losing coverage, policy experts say.

“It’s going to take a bunch of healthy people out of the insurance market,” said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

Obamacare “is going to collapse even more now,” he said.

Republican lawmakers failed several times this year to scrap the mandate as part of a broader repeal of Obamacare, blocked by opposition from a few of the party’s senators, including Susan Collins of Maine.

Collins, still opposed to removing the mandate, said she voted for the tax bill on Saturday after being assured by Republican leaders that they will support legislation to prop up U.S. health insurance markets.

The tax bill is not yet final. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate must now reconcile the differences in their respective versions of the legislation.

“Repealing the individual mandate simply restores to people the freedom to choose,” Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has opposed previous Obamacare repeal efforts, wrote in an opinion piece in Alaska’s Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.

“Instead of taxing people for not being able to afford coverage, we should be working to reduce costs and provide options.”

One of the Obamacare stabilization bills, co-authored by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray, would restore billions of dollars in subsidies that health insurers use to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low income Americans.

A second, co-authored by Collins and Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, would create an additional $4.5 billion fund to compensate insurers for covering health care for the sickest patients.

Still, health policy experts said both of those measures would be needed without a mandate repeal and would not make up for expected premium increases and the rise in the numbers of uninsured Americans.

“Neither of these bills would do anything to offset the increase in uninsured resulting from a mandate repeal,” said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The marketplaces would limp along without a mandate but it’s probably not a stable place.”

Without the mandate, health insurance premiums would rise 10 percent in most years over the next decade on the individual market and 13 million people would lose coverage by 2027, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report last month.

Levitt said that insurers would need around $10 billion per year to offset the lost revenue from the individual mandate rather than raise premiums.

Republicans, who control the White House, U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, failed for months to make good on a top campaign pledge of President Donald Trump.

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said.

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said. But they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when.

Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump aides.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump said on Twitter while he was in New York for a fundraising trip. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Flynn, who on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who was Trump’s national security adviser only for 24 days. He was forced to resign after he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak.

”What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,“ Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for the New York trip. ”There’s been absolutely no collusion, so we’re very happy.”

Legal experts said if Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI and then pressured then-FBI director James Comey not to investigate him, that would be problematic.

If that were the case Trump’s tweet “absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge,” said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Notre Dame University. “It is evidence of the crucial question of whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent.”

In May, the president fired Comey, who later accused Trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the Russia allegations. Comey also said he believed Trump had asked him to drop the FBI’s probe into Flynn.

Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, said the tweet is open to interpretation and that Trump’s lawyer would downplay its significance.

On Friday White House attorney Ty Cobb reacted to Flynn’s guilty plea by saying Flynn’s false statements “mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.”

On Saturday Cobb referred questions about the president’s tweet to Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd, who described it as a “paraphrase of Cobb’s statement.”

The tweet is “bizarre and helpful to Mueller and hurtful to the president,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago now at the law firm Thompson Coburn. “It’s one more piece of evidence that helps show the President’s intent when he fired Comey.”

As part of his plea on Friday, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The retired U.S. Army lieutenant general admitted in a Washington court that he lied to FBI investigators about his discussions last December with Kislyak.

In what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, the pair discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia, and Flynn asked Kislyak to help delay a United Nations vote seen as damaging to Israel, according to prosecutors.

Flynn was also told by a “very senior member” of Trump’s transition team to contact Russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the U.N. vote, the prosecutors said.

Sources told Reuters the “very senior” transition official was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Separately, speaking at a defense conference in California on Saturday, Trump’s current national security advisor H.R. McMaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of Flynn, his immediate predecessor, was hurting U.S. national security.

He regularly argues at home and abroad that the increase in equity prices since his election in November 2016 validates his business-friendly policies and overall stewardship of the economy. What he doesn’t mention is that much of the rest of the world’s bourses actually outperformed America’s in dollar terms, which is what matters to U.S. voters.

Since Trump narrowly beat Democrat Hillary Clinton the S&P 500 index has surged by 23 percent as of late November. That supports the president’s claim, which he recently reiterated at an event with Chinese President Xi Jinping, that some $5 trillion of new wealth has been created “since the very, very well-known and now very important November 8th election.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has doubled down on his boss’s brag, even suggesting that a failure by Congress to pass tax cuts favored by the president would wipe out the stock market’s progress. ”There’s no question in my mind that if we don’t get it done, you’re going to see a reversal of a significant amount of these gains,” he told Politico. Embedded in the administration’s claims is the notion that its policies, most notably tax reform, have been the driving force of the market rally.

America’s corporate tax rate shouldn‘t, in theory, have any bearing on the way investors view the prospects for companies elsewhere – like, say, in Italy. Yet the FTSE MIB index of that nation’s 40 most-traded companies has done nearly twice as well as the S&P since Trump was elected. A healthy American economy helps transatlantic enterprises like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, but the Italian rally is really more indicative of that country’s recovery along with the rebounding European region.

That also explains the 34 percent rise in Germany’s DAX 30 index. And the French equivalent, the CAC 40, surged by 29 percent by the end of November, pretty much in line with the EURO STOXX 50. Even the broader STOXX Europe 600 index nudged its American counterpart aside by a percentage point since Trump won, and even more so since he was inaugurated and officially began making – or in his case mostly unwinding – policy in January.

It’s not just a European thing. Speaking to South Korea’s National Assembly in early November, the president gloated that “the United States is going through something of a miracle” and noted the “stock market is at an all-time high.” Yet the Korea Composite Stock Price Index also trumped the S&P – and the far-narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average – with a 32 percent rally since the election and an even better 38 percent gain in the year through November.

That’s surprising given the escalating saber-rattling between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, who keeps provoking the West with nuclear and ballistic missile tests. But it’s also of a pace with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, which is up 29 percent in dollar terms since Trump won. India’s Nifty 500 index has notched a similar gain, reflecting optimism about growth and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies – not a prospective lowering of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

Indeed, optimism that the global economy is growing robustly, and in unison, for the first time since the financial crisis has also powered other assets besides stocks. The price of copper, which is used in construction, industrial production and other areas sensitive to economic cycles, has risen 29 percent since Trump’s victory – better than the S&P 500. Crude oil prices gained even more, around 37 percent, with the bulk of that increase occurring since the year began.

The rising tide didn’t pull all boats up to America’s level, of course. Japan’s Topix index has been neck-and-neck with the S&P since the election, though it gained 22 percent so far this year, compared to a 17 percent bounce for its American cousin. Canadian stocks rose a respectable, if lagging, 13 percent. And the FTSE 100 index rose only 17 percent after the November 8 election, though perhaps not a disaster given the economic and political ructions the country faces as it divorces from the European Union.

Russia’s MICEX index, with a 19 percent bump, trailed the S&P and other markets since last November. That’s puzzling given the FBI’s contention that Moscow meddled in the election that took Trump to the White House. Then again, it has given nearly all of that up since the inauguration and subsequent investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Only one other major asset has fared worse: the U.S. dollar is down 8 percent against a basket of major currencies. So much for the Trump bump.","Breakingviews - Cox: Trump bump aside, U.S. stocks lag in 2017",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-economy-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-trump-bump-aside-u-s-stocks-lag-in-2017-idUSKBN1DU1Y0

The duo’s recall for the first two tests of the series was greeted with reactions ranging from bemusement to outright abuse, with former test spinner Stuart MacGill dubbing the selectors “morons masquerading as mentors”.

The selection panel, however, may be forgiven for feeling a sense of vindication after Marsh scored an unbeaten 126, while Paine chipped in with a timely 57.

“I haven’t thought about all the incidental noise about my selection for the team,” said Marsh.

“Six months ago I wasn’t sure whether I’d be back here. I’d always dreamt of getting back in. I’ve just tried to come in and feel nice and relaxed. I’ve felt good about my game the last three or four months.”

Marsh and Paine came together with the match delicately balanced with Australia on 209 for five in their first innings on the second day at Adelaide Oval.

They combined for an 85-run partnership that turned the match, perhaps decisively, in the home team’s favour.

They were aided by a little luck and some astute decision-making -- both players were given out leg before wicket to James Anderson before having the decision overturned on review.

Marsh was more measured than Paine for much of the day before cutting loose and notching up his fifth test century, and his first against England.

The left-hander scored a century on debut in 2011 but later missed two years while overcoming a serious back injury. He had averaged a touch over 36 in his previous 24 tests, a mundane return for a specialist batsman.

Paine’s return at the age of 32 was even more extraordinary. The wicketkeeper-batsman from Tasmania had suffered a broken right index finger in 2010 that required multiple surgeries and helped keep him out of the test team for seven years.

He could not even make his state team at the start of this season, but looked every bit a test player on Sunday despite twice being struck on the same finger.

Paine received treatment during a drinks break but carried on batting and duly took his place behind the stumps when Australia took to the field to bowl.

“He was brilliant today, it was hard work this morning with the new ball,” said Marsh. “He got hit on the finger but he’s fine.”","Marsh, Paine repay selectors with key partnership",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cricket-ashes-paine-marsh/marsh-paine-repay-selectors-with-key-partnership-idUKKBN1DX0HO

Earlier, riot police fired water cannon at dozens of protesters who blocked a road leading to the congress, underlining the divisive impact the party has had since it entered the Bundestag lower house for the first time in a Sept. 24 election.

The party’s incumbent leader Jorg Meuthen - seen as a relative moderate in the movement - won enough votes to keep his post.

But in a vote that dragged into the evening, he was joined as co-leader by Gauland, who ran for the post at the last minute after another candidate seen as a moderate, Georg Pazderski, failed to win enough votes.

Before the leadership vote, Meuthen praised the party often beset by internal strife for showing unity after two senior members quit in September in protest against what they saw as an unstoppable populist streak.

“There are people in this country who don’t only say ‘We can do this’ but who actually manage to do something,” Meuthen told delegates, putting a new twist on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s “Wir schaffen das” (We can do it) message to those who doubted Germany can deal with a record influx of migrants in 2015.

VOTES NEXT YEAR

As thousands of protesters marched peacefully outside, AfD delegates watched a short film that painted a gloomy picture of Europe’s largest economy being overrun by beggars, stone-throwers and Muslims.

Founded in 2013 as a vehicle to oppose euro zone bailouts, the AfD was polling at around 3 percent nationally two years ago on the eve of the refugee crisis.

The arrival of more than 1.6 million people seeking asylum in the two years to the end of 2016 has helped it morph into an anti-immigrant party that now has seats in 14 of Germany’s 16 regional parliament.

Polls suggest it will win seats in next year’s regional elections in the southern state of Bavaria and the western region of Hesse, which would give it a foothold in all of Germany’s state parliaments.

Gauland replaces Frauke Petry, who quit to become an independent member of parliament.

Her sudden departure two days after the AfD became the first far-right party to win seats in the Bundestag since the 1950s exposed rifts over whether the party should ditch rhetoric including statements saying Islam was not compatible with the German constitution.",Germany's far-right AfD chooses nationalist as co-leader,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics-afd/germanys-far-right-afd-chooses-nationalist-as-co-leader-idUKKBN1DW0JO

But while the focus of the news has shifted from the battering of Islamic State to the repercussions of the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, there’s been a remarkable silence about one of the Middle East’s most important players: Israel.

In an ironic twist for the Jewish state, the IS losses have consolidated Iran’s strength in the region, allowing Tehran to establish a Shi’ite ""land bridge"" extending through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon to Israel’s northern border. That raises the risk of a military clash between Israel and Iran right at a time when American engagement in the Middle East may start to wane.

This threat is not something the Trump administration can afford to ignore. One of the increased dangers is that Iran’s expanded footprint will make it easier for Tehran to ship weapons through to Hezbollah, its militant proxy in Lebanon. And perhaps even more worrying for Israel, Iran's increasing presence in southern Syria offers Tehran the opportunity to position either its own troops or fighters from Hezbollah or other Shi’ite militias who could strike directly at the Jewish state.

These scenarios are ""red lines"" for Israel – and the Israelis have not hesitated to use military force to enforce red lines in the past. Over the last several years, Israeli jets have struck dozens of shipments of weapons such as guided missiles and anti-aircraft systems bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israeli leaders remain committed to prevent the transfer of those weapons in the future. In 2015, an Israeli strike on the Syrian Golan Heights killed both an Iranian general as well as the commander of Hezbollah's forces in Syria and Israel – as if to emphasize its ability to do so again – publicly revealed it knew the identity of Hezbollah's new commander in southern Syria.

It’s easy to imagine different situations in which Iranian-Israeli tensions could erupt into a military confrontation. Israel is unlikely to stop bombing Iranian weapons shipments bound for Hezbollah or even directly striking Syrian military positions if errant fire lands in Israeli territory. For its part, Iran’s military chief of staff responded to a recent Israeli strike on Syrian military positions with a warning that it was “not acceptable for the Zionist regime to violate Syria any time it wants.” Another possibility is that an Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia – one of which recently announced its intention to ""liberate"" the Israeli Golan Heights – could attack Israeli troops, leading to an Israeli response that could draw in Iranian fighters. In a worst-case scenario, Israeli bombing raids into Syria could even bring it into direct clashes with Russian forces in the country to support Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.

In the case of Lebanon, there are fears that Israel could be dragged into the conflict if Hezbollah seeks what former U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro calls “an accelerated confrontation with Israel as a means of unifying Lebanese support for their dominance.” With Iranian troops reportedly on Israel’s northern border, it’s possible that if conflict breaks out in Lebanon Israeli troops could clash directly with Iranian forces.

The Trump administration must recognize that any Israeli-Iranian military conflict in Syria would threaten American interests. For one, it could interfere with America's ability to finish off Islamic State now that the Sunni extremist group has lost its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. For another, if Washington’s longstanding alliance with Israel forces it to join the fray, Iran could see that as an opportunity to retaliate against American interests throughout the Middle East. Indeed, given Moscow's alliance with Tehran in Syria, any U.S. participation in an Israeli-Iranian conflict might even lead to American forces facing off against the Russians – a risk that has already been raised.

As much as the Trump administration might want to simply finish off Islamic State and then be done with Syria, it can't afford to do so. The 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which began after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in a raid, is a stark reminder that in the Middle East even minor incidents can spark a conflagration.

Washington therefore needs to step in now to address potential flashpoints.

First, the U.S. must take Israeli concerns about Iran's presence in Syria more seriously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed the southern Syria July ceasefire negotiated between the United States and Russia because it perpetuated the Iranian presence in Syria, with one senior Israeli official telling Israel’s Haaretz newspaper that the deal didn't ""include a single explicit word about Iran, Hezbollah or the Shi’ite militias in Syria.” Given that it’s uncertain how effective the Trump administration might be in reining in Israel during a crisis, American policy makers are better served by taking Israel's interests into account before a conflict breaks out.

Second, the administration should send a clear warning to Tehran through diplomatic back channels that Washington would consider unacceptable any attempt by Iran to escalate its confrontation with Israel either directly or through proxies. Since it’s not clear that Jared Kushner – who plays a key role for the Trump administration in the Middle East – possesses the experience or credibility to do this, the message should come from senior military or Pentagon officials.

Third, the U.S. must push Russia to be proactive about containing Iran. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed his concerns about Iran’s presence in Syria to Russian President Vladimir Putin, it’s not clear if Putin is willing to do so – nor what he might want in return. It’s therefore up to American officials to tell their Russian counterparts that Washington expects Moscow to do its part to prevent the widening of regional conflict. In exchange, Washington can offer Russia a chance to be treated as a world power and on an equal footing with the United States – a longtime priority for Putin.

Israeli planners want the United States to have a strategy for Syria.

“Strasbourg must remain the seat of European democracy. It’s also the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation,” she said on France 3 television.

“It is often said that Europe comes down to the Brussels bubble. Europe needs to be closer to its regions,” she added.

Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) convene in Strasbourg for one week every month and in Brussels for the remainder. The monthly upheaval costs the bloc 114 million euros ($124 million) a year, EU auditors say.

Critics have long called for the arrangement to be scrapped, but it has stayed in place largely because France would have vetoed any attempt to make the required amendment to the EU treaty.

Some lawmakers had hoped the election victory of pro-EU President Emmanuel Macron could help plans to close the base in the French city.

On Brexit negotiations, Loiseau said there were “positive noises” ahead of a summit in Brussels set to decide whether enough progress has been made on the first phase of negotiations to move on to talks about a post-Brexit trade relationship.

But she said France remained vigilant on the issue of the land border with Ireland. “It’s a red line which was drawn by the 27 member states and by the United Kingdom, accepted by them,” she said.

Loiseau also said France was waiting for conclusions from the Eurostat statistics agency on whether the reimbursements it is due to make to companies after a dividend tax was canceled by courts should be all included in its 2017 accounts.

That would scupper the French government’s plans to bring its budget deficit below the EU-mandated 3 percent in 2017.

“In all logic, there is no reason to attribute the whole 10 billion euros to 2017. That’s what we explained, we are waiting for Eurostat answers,” she said.

Loiseau, a career diplomat, also said she was disappointed by Germany’s decision to vote in favor of clearing the use of weedkiller glyphosate for the next five years earlier this week.","European parliament not moving from Strasbourg, France says",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DX0I1

We doubters have to decide between surrender and struggle. I choose the latter. Bitcoin and its many electronic rivals suffer from numerous incurable flaws – economic, social and cultural.

The biggest economic weakness is not in the underlying blockchain technology, although tales of hacking and lost tokens suggest there are serious kinks to work out. Nor is the main problem the high energy usage involved in creating new coins, although it is alarming.

There’s a more fundamental economic confusion to consider. As a currency, these electronic tokens simply cannot have both of the advantages backers ascribe to them. If they are collectible items, which are expected to rise in value, they cannot also be attractive alternatives to government-regulated mediums of exchange.

After all, when owners of assets think their property will become more valuable, they do not sell. Thus bitcoins can be expected to be hoarded as long as the price keeps rising. And when the market turns, then no law-abiding merchant will be willing to accept them. They do not have to, because there is a great alternative: traditional currencies. Not only does legal tender come with low transaction costs, these monies only lose value at the very slow pace of inflation.

If bitcoin buyers were serious about its potential functionality, they would be devastated by the recent vertiginous price increases – a doubling in three months. After so much volatility, it would take years of price stability for legitimate merchants to take it seriously as a currency.

If that were not enough, bitcoin and its ilk have another fatal economic problem. They are not trustworthy. Even without the numerous breathless websites covering the ever-increasing supply of crypto-currencies, a bunch of mutually suspicious computer nerds who keep tinkering with the formula just cannot inspire confidence.

Again, the alternative is much better. In the world of government-supported money, hyperinflation is extraordinarily rare. And while bank failures that end with write-downs of account balances happen, hacks and other losses of crypto-currencies are far more frequent. Even the 2008 financial crisis, which was a terrible moment for bank-created money, ended with almost no losses for ordinary savers.

One thing that blinds many crypto-currency backers to economic reality is libertarianism. Government-haters believe any temporary problems with private currencies are worth enduring, since they will free societies from the yoke of the state’s monetary oppression.

A variety of that argument clearly works for criminals. It is not an accident that the most regular use of bitcoin is for illegal activities. The logic is simple and persuasive. While movements of the unregulated electronic tokens are much more expensive and less secure than bank transfers, they come with a lower risk of prison terms.

“Bitcoin, the outlaw’s friend” is not much of a slogan. Enthusiasts are undaunted, however. When their reasoning is not merely vacuous – it will work because it is such a good idea – it is frequently apocalyptic. They believe that the end is near for our whole corrupt and violently polarised culture. In this nihilistic narrative, bitcoin (or Ethereum or whatever) will be the end-times currency of choice. It has rules and protocols, so it does not need governments and laws.

Such claims are ridiculous. The internet, the cloud and the whole network of computers needed to keep bitcoin in business can only function with the support of reasonably effective governments. If anarchy ever comes, computer records, especially complex distributed systems like bitcoin, will be totally useless.

The problems with crypto-currencies are so glaring that something irrational must be sustaining the zeal. One possibility is that bitcoin has become what could be called a post-modern luxury good. Unlike most luxuries, they offer no beauty, pleasure or even natural scarcity. They do not really even have artificial scarcity, since it’s fairly easy to create a new one. What they can offer is the strange and decadent charm of self-created value.

Before letting the dogs of cultural criticism loose, though, there is a far simpler explanation: the well-known distortion of judgment caused by greed. When buyers of bitcoin talk about blockchain, dangerous governments or the coming apocalypse they are merely putting a thin whitewash of intellectual respectability over their craving for capital gains.

For now, bitcoin is working out well for speculators, if not for society. Here is a helpful market hint for holders, though. Do not all try to cash in at once. Or better yet, do, and soon. The bigger the bitcoin bubble becomes, the more likely it is to do serious economic damage when it bursts.","Breakingviews - Hadas: Bitcoin at $10,000 is even more dangerous",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-bitcoin-breakingviews/breakingviews-hadas-bitcoin-at-10000-is-even-more-dangerous-idUSKBN1DT1F7

The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added.

The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N).

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

“(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.",Aetna's board set to approve $68 billion sale to CVS Health: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/aetnas-board-set-to-approve-68-billion-sale-to-cvs-health-sources-idUKKBN1DX0NM?il=0

West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.

The accelerated pace of North Korea’s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.

On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday.

Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.

“It’s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,” the Alabama Congressman and Republican told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California.

When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill‎ said in a statement: “The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.”

The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department.

Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are “competing” for the missile defense installations.

Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites.

The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined.

THAAD is a ground-based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install.

In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed.

A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company “is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.” He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision.

In July, the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The successful test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military’s missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures.

Currently, the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD) in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships. The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD.

The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

North Korea’s latest missile test puts the U.S. capital within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday.",Exclusive: Pentagon evaluating U.S. West Coast missile defense sites - officials,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DX04W-OCATP

To advocates who believe that sending weapons to the Ukrainian government will bloody Russia’s nose and send President Vladimir Putin a message, this pending decision couldn’t have come soon enough. Arming Kiev is a popular prescription supported by top military officers and many lawmakers in both parties.

Popular, however, doesn’t mean smart. Opening up America’s stockpile to Ukraine is not in Washington’s national security interest. In fact, it is bound to make a conflict that is mostly frozen into a more deadly one and it complicates any reasonable chance of a diplomatic resolution.

While it may be uncomfortable to admit, the political orientation of Ukraine and how Ukrainians choose to manage (or mismanage) their economy and political system doesn’t directly affect the United States. As Rajan Menon and William Ruger wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine last month, “Ukraine matters more to Russia than it does to the United States.”

To Washington, Ukraine is a post-Soviet state whose oligarchic politics and systemic corruption have severely handicapped the country’s economic outlook. U.S. security interests in Europe are not wedded to whether Kiev succeeds in establishing a more democratic and accountable form of government. At best, Ukraine is a peripheral country that the United States doesn’t have a treaty obligation to defend if its territory is invaded.

To Putin, however, Ukraine is an integral puzzle in his grand strategy of making Russia as relevant a global player as it was during the Cold War. A wholesale Westernization of Ukrainian politics, from associations with the European Union (EU) to a possible membership in NATO, would destroy that ambition and ruin a significant portion of Putin’s political legacy. Indeed, the possibility of Ukraine increasing its trade relationship and political direction with the United States and Europe was enough of a national security threat to Putin that he was willing to deploy Russian soldiers, paratroopers, and special forces on Ukrainian territory to carve out a zone of influence there. Putin’s belief that a Russian-friendly Ukraine is a national security imperative for Moscow won’t be changed by a couple dozen anti-tank missiles from the United States.

FILE PHOTO: Members of the Ukrainian armed forces patrol near Artemivsk a day after intense fighting with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, June 4, 2015 REUTERS/Gleb Garanich

The second concern for the Trump administration is how Putin might respond to any escalation. As former National Security Council official Charles Kupchan argued in the Washington Post: “The notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin would give up his hold on Donbass [Eastern Ukraine] if a few more Russians come home in body bags is to dramatically misread the Kremlin.” Yet this false assumption is what undergirds the arguments from proponents of lethal assistance to the Ukrainians.

It’s impossible to understand why some U.S. legislators are so confident that Moscow will react in the way they expect. The three-and-a-half year long war has shown that Russia is ruthless in escalating its involvement and investment in the conflict to prevent a military victory for Kiev. In fact, to expect that Moscow would respond to more Russian casualties by suing for a peace settlement is to ignore completely how Putin has behaved since Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.

FILE PHOTO: Pro-Russian armed men stand guard during a rally to celebrate the results of a referendum calling for the Luhansk region to become part of Russia, May 12, 2014. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko

When separatist units in Donetsk and Luhansk were losing ground to pro-Kiev forces early in the war, Russia came to their rescue. In the summer of 2014, when pro-Ukrainian troops were retaking towns that Kiev previously lost, columns of Russian tanks, artillery, heavy weapons, and soldiers crossed the border into Ukraine to ensure that there were no more Ukrainian territorial advances in strategic areas. When the stalemated battle in the city of Ilovaisk was slowly moving Kiev’s way, conventional Russian soldiers and weapons were fast-tracked to the frontline in what would turn out to be one of the deadliest days for Ukrainian troops in the war.

Months later, when the separatists were in jeopardy of retreating from the strategic town of Delbatseve, Russian tanks were deployed and quickly forced an undermanned, disorganized, demoralized, and tired contingent of Kiev forces to withdraw. There’s no reason to think that Putin would respond less violently now if Washington sent defense shipments to Ukraine.

The most negative impact of additional U.S. involvement is that it will likely spoil Moscow’s willingness to cooperate on a Ukrainian peacekeeping proposal. While Moscow has insisted that the 2014 and 2015 Minsk protocols are the only way the war in Ukraine can end peacefully, Putin has openly acknowledged that there may need to be greater international involvement if that peace is to be sustainable. He broached the subject of deploying U.N. troops along the contact line this September and even agreed to explore greater access to peacekeepers in separatist-controlled territory after a call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The concept is now being discussed within the Trump administration and between the U.S. and Russian special envoys to the conflict, suggesting sincerity on the Russian side.

A White House authorization to send equipment to Kiev could stop that dialogue. It’s difficult to understand why the United States would escalate the war when there may finally be an opening to explore a U.N.-enforced cessation of hostilities that could lead to a political settlement to the conflict.

The Russians could respond to increased U.S. involvement in Ukraine in other ways too. Moscow could, for example, use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block U.S.-led efforts to stop North Korea’s nuclear program. Putin could expand military and intelligence cooperation with Iran to undermine the Trump administration’s policy of containing Iranian expansionism.

The costs to the U.S. of turning Ukraine into a proxy war against Russia overshadow the benefit of increasing Moscow’s casualty count. Sending arms to Kiev will do very little to help resolve the conflict. Sometimes the best course of action for the White House is not to get more involved on issues peripheral to American grand strategy.",Commentary: Why the U.S. shouldn’t send arms to Ukraine,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-depetris-ukraine-commentary/commentary-why-the-u-s-shouldnt-send-arms-to-ukraine-idUSKBN1DS1XZ

A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East.

Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to “discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern”, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.

“It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and holds a very high risk of provoking Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities in the West,” said the diplomatic source, asking not to be named.

King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.

Word of Trump’s planned announcement, which would deviate from previous U.S. presidents who have insisted the Jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority and was sure to anger the broader Arab world.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel’s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city’s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.

“It is essential no unilateral decisions are made that would change the historic status quo of Jerusalem as an occupied city whose fate needs to be determined in final status talks within an overall peace package,” the senior Jordanian diplomatic source added.",Jordan begins diplomatic offensive ahead of Trump move on Jerusalem,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jordan-usa-jerusalem/jordan-begins-diplomatic-offensive-ahead-of-trump-move-on-jerusalem-idUSKBN1DX0OY?il=0

The tourists, who sent the Australians in to bat after winning the toss on Saturday, had made 29 for one in reply when rain brought a premature end to the day’s play at Adelaide Oval.

It looked like something of a reprieve for England, who had already lost Mark Stoneman for 18 to leave Alastair Cook, unbeaten on 11, and James Vince, yet to score, facing a night assault from Australia’s pace battery.

Marsh had earlier put the hosts on the front foot with his fifth test century, a 231-ball vindication of the decision by the Australian selectors to hand the 34-year-old his eighth test recall.

”We knew if we could bat for most of the day and put them in under lights we’d be a chance,“ Marsh told reporters. ”To be nice and patient, and get a hundred there at the end was pleasing.

“It’s great to be playing for Australia and just to be out there in the middle.”

Marsh had to grit it out at times as England produced a much improved bowling performance after a disappointing day one and had the Decision Review System (DRS) to thank for a life after initially being given out lbw to James Anderson on 29.

Tim Paine, who joined Marsh at the crease when Stuart Broad dismissed Peter Handscomb lbw with the third delivery of the day, was similarly reprieved when tracking showed an Anderson delivery would have gone over the stumps.

Marsh put on 85 with Paine as the two most controversial selections in the Australia squad for the first two tests frustrated England before the wicketkeeper holed out for 57 -- a third test half century coming seven years after his second.

DROPPED CATCH

The left-hander then put together a stand of 99 with Pat Cummins, reaching the hundred mark in the process with a sumptuous pull off a Chris Woakes delivery which raced to the square leg boundary for his 12th four.

The batsman whipped off his helmet to acknowledge the applause of another bumper crowd at the Adelaide Oval and almost immediately had another reprieve when Cook and James Vince collided in the gully with neither able to take a simple catch.

Slideshow (20 Images)

If much of Marsh’s progress to the century had been a stop-start affair, there was nothing cautious about the way he punished the tourists for their profligacy after the break as Steve Smith pondered the declaration.

With Cummins initially providing back-up with his highest test score, a seven-boundary 44, Marsh added three more fours and a punishing straight six off Broad to finish unbeaten on 126 when Smith finally called him in.

“Some days it goes your ways and some it doesn‘t,” England coach Trevor Bayliss said.

“There’s a good feeling in the dressing room. They’re certainly not disheartened at all. Shaun showed it’s not impossible to score runs out there. It will be up to one of our guys to go out and make a bit score, not just 40 or 50.”

England, already 1-0 down in the five-match series after a 10-wicket loss in Brisbane last week, made a reasonable start before Mitchell Starc sent down a fizzing yorker that trapped Stoneman in front.

To add insult to injury on a day when the DRS had worked so well for Australia, Stoneman referred the decision, only for the tracking to show the ball would have clattered into his leg stump.",Marsh century puts Australia in charge in Adelaide,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cricket-ashes/marsh-century-puts-australia-in-charge-in-adelaide-idUKKBN1DX069

Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation and representatives for Simmons did not reply to a request for comment.

“While her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real,” Simmons said in his Instagram statement. “While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologize.”

“Che ci siano prove di mancato dialogo tra Bankitalia e Consob sulle banche venete era già emerso, anche su Banca Ferrara... che ci siano state incongruenze da parte di Bankitalia su Etruria mi pare che sia agli atti”, ha detto l‘ex premier durante un‘intervista a Radio Capital.

Ieri, durante un‘audizione davanti alla commissione parlamentare d‘inchiesta sulle banche, il procuratore di Arezzo Roberto Rossi ha detto che nel 2015 Banca d‘Italia fece pressioni per una fusione tra Banca Etruria e Banca Popolare di Vicenza, istituto già in difficoltà.

Una fonte di via Nazionale ha replicato dicendo che l‘aggregazione fu proposta dalla Banca Popolare di Vicenza nel 2014.

“Credo che bisogna dire la verità: la vicenda della commissione d‘inchesta sulle banche dimostra che la discussione di questi due anni, per cui sembrava che ci fosse chissà quale pasticcio da parte del governo in carica, era quanto meno sfasata”, ha detto Renzi, che all‘epoca sedeva a Palazzo Chigi.

“Non c‘è il pasticcio del Pd su Banca Etruria e Banca di Ferrara, viene fuori che i pasticci li hano fatti altri”, ha aggiunto.

“La vicenda di Boschi e di Etruria è stata considerata come un alibi per non affrontare il vero problema, e cioè che un sacco di risparmiatori... sono stati fregati dalle banche... con l‘unico scopo di non parlare dei problemi veri”, ha detto ancora Renzi.

But he does fear robbery or kidnap by militia gangs.

With Afghan forces improving and on the offensive, U.S. commanders have more freedom to attack the Taliban and insurgents no longer threaten any major urban centers.

Although Taliban-controlled areas begin within a 10-minute drive of the city, Kunduz - a strategic hub that fell twice in the past two years - is largely calm. But there is a long way to go to build confidence in daily security.

“In the past people were afraid that the Taliban would come but no-one talks about that now,” said Najibullah, who like many Afghans, uses only one name.

“Now we have internal problems,” he said, leaning over the counter of his shop in the city center and talking softly to avoid being overheard. “There are gunmen that do anything they want. There are people in this city, if they know you have money they’ll come to your shop and rob you in broad daylight.”

Outside the city, where the Taliban still hold sway, the risk of being caught between helicopter gunships and the insurgents or swept up in a clearing operation means life is also more difficult for villagers on the front line.

Last month, locals say 16 people were killed by U.S. helicopters in a night raid near the villages of Qatl-e Am and Gharow Qushlaq in Chahardara district, an area largely controlled by the Taliban. A U.S. investigation concluded there was no evidence any civilians were killed.

“Since the Americans announced their new strategy and signed the new agreement, the situation has been getting worse,” said Atiqullah, a villager who said he was about three kilometers away when the raid took place.

NOT SAFE

The shift in perceptions on the ground suggests ordinary Afghans are seeing the fresh strategy is hitting the insurgents. But their new fears underline how much more is needed to build trust in the Western-backed government.

“I‘m a businessman but I can’t go anywhere without a gun,” said Jamal Nasir Aymaq, who owns a number of bakeries in the city. “Our businessmen and rich people have already escaped Kunduz and children are not safe.”

Kidnapping and robbery are rife and there is little confidence of justice from a government many see as deeply implicated in abuses by rogue militia “commanders” who operate with impunity.

“We all know peace cannot be achieved by force alone, it needs development and the economy,” said Kunduz police chief Abdul Hameed Hameedi. “Security is much better than last year but we haven’t got what people are expecting yet.”

Kunduz Governor Asadullah Omarkhil dismissed talk of any official collusion in kidnapping as “baseless”, but while many people fear the Taliban, many also feel they are more honest and efficient than city officials.

“If there were a real government in the center of Kunduz, people wouldn’t be going to the Taliban for legal decisions,” said Mawlawi Khosh Mohammad Nasratyar, a member of the Kunduz provincial council. “Now, even people from the center of Kunduz go to the Taliban to settle legal cases.”

OPTIMISM

The wariness among many Afghans contrasts with optimism among Western officials, who say the new approach is starting to turn a stalemate with the Taliban around.

“The air strikes have made all the difference,” said one Western diplomat in Kabul. “When you go to (the NATO-led Resolute Support mission) headquarters, there’s a bit of a buzz about the place that wasn’t there before and a feeling they’re back on the front foot.”

So far in 2017, U.S. forces have dropped three times the quantity of bombs as last year and special forces units have been in regular action with their Afghan counterparts.

Hundreds of Taliban fighters and many senior leaders have been killed, including Mullah Abdul Salam, mastermind of the assault that saw the Taliban flag raised over Kunduz in 2015, the first time the insurgents had taken a major town.

Similar successes have been seen in other towns including Tarin Kot in the central province of Uruzgan, which the Taliban briefly overran last year, or Lashkar Gah in Helmand, which they have also come close to taking.

“Two years ago, there was a fear of Taliban attack on the city every minute and we couldn’t come into the office,” said Kunduz provincial council secretary Fawzia Jawad Yaftali. “But now everything is different, the shops are open and I‘m sitting in my office without any fear,” she said.

CIVILIAN CASUALTIES

The campaign has not been without cost however and hanging over it is the fact that the air strikes have inevitably brought more civilian casualties in their wake, even if their numbers are still well below those killed by roadside bombs.

In a briefing this week, the commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan General John Nicholson said they go to “extraordinary lengths” to avoid civilian casualties and have “a rigorous process” to investigate allegations.

But people from Chahardara react with deep anger to official denials that the raid on Nov. 3-4 killed at least 16 civilians.

“The helicopter started bombing at three in the morning. Afterwards, at about 6 o’clock a lot of people gathered to help and then the helicopter came back. That was the big bomb,” said Mohebullah, a village elder.

“Sixteen people were killed and six wounded,” he said, showing a handwritten list of names. “They have advanced equipment, they should be sure of who they are attacking. They should target criminals not innocent and helpless people.”

The United Nations mission in Afghanistan said reports of at least 10 deaths were “credible”. A U.S. investigation found no evidence of any civilian casualties but Capt. Thomas Gresback, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said they would engage in dialogue with anyone who came forward with information.

“Most of the propaganda about civilian casualties comes from the enemy,” said Governor Omarkhil, who said only one person was killed in the incident. “In Chahardara, the Taliban made people go to the battle zone and take out dead bodies.”

The U.S. military says the Taliban deliberately shelters in houses and schools but the issue, over which former Afghan President Hamid Karzai repeatedly clashed with Washington, causes deep resentment, sapping support for the government.

“The people who were killed were all civilians, they had nothing to do with the government or the Taliban,” said Mohebullah. “Everyone lost a family member, everyone is shocked and in grief. The governor is lying.”","Crime, casualties undermine U.S. gains on Afghan battlefield",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-security/crime-casualties-undermine-u-s-gains-on-afghan-battlefield-idINKBN1DX03N

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

On the other, leader of the opposition Labour party Jeremy Corbyn, who ramped up attacks on bankers after a sell-side analyst criticised his policies. The row shows the enduring costs of bank excess.

Corbyn’s criticisms of Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman’s pay and “speculators” in general seem a little out of date. Regulators across Europe have limited bonuses since the financial crisis, and banks have cut remuneration. Average bank CEO pay has fallen, in real terms, by 49 percent since 2006 according to analysts at New Financial. The think-tank reckons that pay as a proportion of revenues at investment banks declined by 9 percentage points to 37 percent over the decade to 2016.

Still, bankers are an easy target for Corbyn. The fact that CEO salary is still on average $11.4 million a year underlines their stratospheric levels of remuneration before the crisis. True, that’s not out of whack with other firms, as Ermotti pointed out with a jibe at “big tech” companies. But neither Google nor Amazon took state capital; nor do they benefit from an implicit government guarantee which keeps their funding costs low.

Shareholders have also suffered. Over the past decade European banks’ total shareholder returns, including reinvested dividends, have averaged minus 39 percent compared with a positive 48 percent for the STOXX Europe 600 index. Leave out the crisis years of 2008 and 2009, and banks still only returned 10 percent, barely a 10th of the broader index.

Bankers might dismiss Corbyn’s broadside as hyperbole. There is nothing in Labour’s recent manifesto which explicitly targets banks. That would be naive. The risk is that the UK Conservative government now feels that it has to match Corbyn’s invective. And there’s plenty a Labour government could do to attack banks, such as imposing transaction taxes or nationalisation. That would hit Britain hard, if it meant bankers left for more business-friendly countries, but shareholders would be wise to act first.",Breakingviews - Jeremy Corbyn pay row shows costs of bank excess,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-jeremy-corbyn-pay-row-shows-costs-of-bank-excess-idUSKBN1DV5CN

Xi’s comments were read by Huang Kunming, head of the Chinese Communist Party’s publicity department at the country’s largest public cyber policy forum in the town of Wuzhen in eastern China.

“The development of China’s cyberspace is entering a fast lane...China’s doors will only become more and more open,” said Xi in the note.

Cyber sovereignty is the idea that states should be permitted to manage and contain their own internet without external interference.

China’s Communist Party has tightened cyber regulation in the past year, formalizing new rules that require firms to store data locally and censor tools that allow users to subvert the Great Firewall.

In June, China introduced a new national cybersecurity law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures.

Cyber regulators say the laws are in line with international rules, and that they are designed to protect personal privacy and counter attacks on core infrastructure. Business groups say the rules unfairly target foreign firms.

China has advocated strongly for a larger role in global internet governance under Xi.

The agreement on a range of often politically sensitive measures - covering fiscal issues, energy and labor market reforms, bad loans and privatizations - could open up fresh loans and push Greece further along the path toward a return to full market financing.

“The institutions’ visit is completed, we closed the staff level agreement,” Greece’s Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters on Saturday.

“The European institutions have reached a staff level agreement with the Greek authorities on the policy package supporting the ESM (European Stability Programme) program,” an EU statement said later on Saturday.

The agreement between Greek officials and European Union and International Monetary Fund representatives on the country’s compliance with reforms and future commitments must be approved by euro zone finance ministers, scheduled to meet on Dec. 4.

Under the deal, Athens will need to implement a broad set of reforms as part of the so-called third review of its bailout program.

Once concluded, the review is expected to release about five billion euros in loans from the current 86-billion-euro bailout program, its third since 2010. EU officials said this could be done before the end of January, if all proceeded smoothly.

At least another review of agreed reforms will be necessary before the end of the program in August.

Athens and its lenders had been exchanging drafts on agreed and proposed reforms for days. After seven years of austerity and rescue loans amounting to about 270 billion euros ($320 billion), Greece hopes its third bailout will be its last.

The government has been keen to swiftly conclude the review, which started in October, to begin talks on debt relief and the terms of the country’s exit from the bailout program.

“The speed with which this deal was reached is a signal that Greece is fully committed to conclude the program,” an EU official told Reuters.

The region has thriving tech hubs in major cities, with record new funding, experienced entrepreneurs, a growing base of technical talent and an improving regulatory climate, according to a study by European venture firm Atomico.

“The probability that the next industry-defining company could come from Europe - and become one of the world’s most valuable companies - has never been higher,” said Tom Wehmeier, Atomico’s head of research, who authored the report.

Top venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in the region told Reuters they are increasingly confident that the next world-class companies could emerge from Europe in fields including artificial intelligence, video gaming, music and messaging.

“What we still need to develop is entrepreneurs who have the drive to take it all the way - I think we are starting to see that now,” said Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at venture fund Balderton Capital, who sold his software company Business Objects to SAP for $6.8 billion a decade ago.

The Atomico report is being published in conjunction with the annual Nordic technology start-up festival taking place in Helsinki this week and set to draw some 20,000 participants.

STRONGER FUNDAMENTALS

Capital invested in European tech companies is on track to reach a record this year, with $19.1 billion in funding projected through the end of 2017 - up 33 percent over 2016, according to investment tracking firm Dealroom.co.

The median size of European venture funds nearly tripled to around 58 million euros ($68.7 million) in 2017 compared with five years ago, according to Invest Europe’s European Data Cooperative on fundraising investment activity.

Beyond the availability of funding, Europe has a range of technical talent available to work more cheaply than in Silicon Valley, enabling start-ups to get going with far less funding.

With a pool of professional developers now numbering 5.5 million, European tech employment outpaces the comparable 4.4 million employed in the United States, according to data from Stack Overflow, a site popular with programmers.

London remains the top European city in terms of numbers of professional developers, but Germany, as a country, overtook Britain in the past year with 837,398 developers compared with 813,500, the report states, using Stack Overflow statistics.

While median salaries for software engineers are rising in top European cities Berlin, London, Paris and Barcelona, they are one-third to one-half the average cost of salaries in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is more than $129,000, based on Glassdoor recruiting data.

PUSHING UP AGAINST LIMITS

Big hurdles remain. A survey of 1,000 founders by authors of the report found European entrepreneurs were worried by Brexit, with concerns, especially in Britain, over hiring, investment and heightened uncertainty in the business climate.

Although Europe has deep engineering talent, many big startups focus on business model innovation in areas such as media, retail and gaming rather than on breakthrough technology developments that can usher in new industries, critics say.

Regulatory frameworks in Europe put the brakes on development on promising technologies such as cryptocurrencies, “flying taxis” and gene editing, while autonomous vehicles and drones face fewer obstacles, the report says.

A separate study by Index Ventures, also to be published on Thursday, found that employees at fast-growing tech start-ups in Europe tend to receive only half the stock option stakes that are a primary route to riches for their U.S. rivals. Yet their options are taxed twice as much.

The Index report said employees in successful, later-stage European tech start-ups receive around 10 percent of capital, compared with 20 percent ownership in Silicon Valley firms.

“There is quite a gap today between stock option practices in Europe and those in Silicon Valley,” Index Ventures partner Martin Mignot said in an interview. “There are other issues where Europe is behind, but we think stock options should be at the top of the agenda.”

Another factor holding back Europe is that regional stock markets encourage firms to go public prematurely, Liataud said.

“Europe has markets for average companies. In the U.S., going public is hard. You have to be really, really good. You have to be $100 million, minimum, in revenue,” the French entrepreneur-turned-investor said. “Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange have not lowered their standards.”

“Efforts are ongoing to make sure that power supply is restored to all parts of the country,” the state-run Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) said in a statement.

TANESCO apologised for the power outage, but did not explain what caused a “technical glitch” in the national power grid that left the region’s No. 3 economy in a blackout that lasted more than 12 hours on Thursday.

Power was restored in many parts of commercial capital Dar es Salaam late on Thursday.

TANESCO said it had also restored electricity in the administrative capital Dodoma, as well as Iringa region in the centre and Tanga in the north east.

Partial blackouts occur regularly in Tanzania, which relies on hydro, natural gas and heavy fuel oil to generate electricity. Many businesses use power generators as backups, pushing up their operating costs.

Tanzania’s energy infrastructure has suffered from decades of underinvestment, neglect and corruption allegations, and investors have long complained the lack of reliable power hurts business there.

President John Magufuli is pushing a major hydropower project at Stiegler’s Gorge in the UNESCO-designated Selous Game Reserve to help tackle chronic electricity shortages.

The project would more than double the country’s current power generation capacity of around 1,500 megawatts (MW). The government has not said how much the project would cost or how it would raise financing, but wants it completed within three years.

Tanzania aims to boost power generation capacity to 10,000 MW over the next decade by also using some of its vast natural gas and coal reserves.",Tanzania restores power in parts of country after nationwide outage,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1DV4YK-OZABS

The umbrella organization for the world’s central banks gave the warning as investors continue to bask in what it called the “light and warmth” of improving global growth, subdued inflation and soaring stock markets.

Record high debt levels, however, highlight vulnerabilities in the financial system and the scale of this year’s rally in asset prices seems to have increased caution at the Switzerland-based BIS.

“High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy (asset price) valuations,” the head of BIS’s monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said.

“The longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence.”

There was some surprise too that benchmark bond yields - which drive global borrowing costs - have stayed down even with the Federal Reserve now shrinking its balance sheet and the European Central Bank also about to heavily cut its stimulus.

The improving global growth outlook, Japan’s ongoing money printing and the message from both the Fed and ECB that they will tread carefully going forward was the likely explanation for still low yields, though they did raise a “deeper question”.

“Can a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions unambiguously ease? And, if the answer is no, what should central banks do?” Borio said.

The pace of tightening from the likes of the Fed is already expected to be the slowest on record.

One concern is that the continued low bond yields and low market volatility, particularly in the United States, are reminiscent of the bond market “conundrum” referred to by former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in 2005 before the financial crisis.

Yields remained low then too despite a run of U.S. rate hikes and only gained any traction later in the cycle.

“In an era in which gradualism and predictability are becoming the norm, these questions (about effective tightening) are likely to grow more pressing.”

It is especially the case with some stock market gauges now in “frothy” territory.

At recent levels in excess of 30, the U.S. stock market’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), for example, has exceeded its post-1982 average by almost 25 percent.

The dividend payout ratio of U.S. companies is also back at highs observed in the 1970s and so might not go much further. “High valuations: market complacency?” the BIS posed the question, though it said stocks did look much less frothy when measured against extremely low bonds yields.

(FB.O) on Friday urged a U.S. patent court to disregard drugmaker Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) contention that its transfer of some of its patents to a Native American tribe shields them from the court’s review.

The Allergan logo is seen in this photo illustration in Singapore November 23, 2015. REUTERS/Thomas White

Two trade groups comprised of tech industry leaders argued in a joint brief submitted to the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board that the board has the right to review the validity of patents covering the dry eye medicine Restasis that Allergan transferred to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in a deal announced in September.

“This panel’s statutory authority to review whether the Restasis patents were properly granted as a matter of federal law does not and should not depend on the identity of the patents’ owner,” said the trade group.

Allergan is arguing the tribe’s sovereign status means the patent review board, an administrative court, has no jurisdiction over the transferred patents. The tribe agreed to exclusively license the Restasis patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments.

Many technology companies have praised the patent court, saying it is a low-cost and efficient way to cancel dubious patents used to bring abusive lawsuits. They fear that, if upheld, Allergan’s strategy could be widely adopted and used against them.

The case before the patent board stems from a challenge to the Restasis patents brought by generic drug companies led by Mylan NV (MYL.O). Generic makers had been blocked from selling their own versions of the blockbuster medicine until the patents expired in 2024.

But a federal judge in Texas already invalidated the Restasis patents in a separate proceeding, rendering Allergan’s tribal deal effectively meaningless. The company had said it did not object to federal court review of its patents but felt the administrative process was unfair.

Despite that ruling, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board is hearing arguments on whether it must accept Allergan’s tribal immunity argument.

A group of prominent law professors, including Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School and Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of California at Berkeley, submitted a brief on Friday siding with the tribe and Allergan.

“Far from being a scheme to shield patents from review, the agreement from the Tribe’s perspective is part of its economic development plan,” the academics said. “The Allergan-Mohawk contract reflects exactly the sort of economic entrepreneurship that Congress has been urging upon tribes.”",Tech firms tell patent court to ignore Allergan deal with tribe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-patent/tech-firms-tell-patent-court-to-ignore-allergan-deal-with-tribe-idUSKBN1DV63M

Then to add on to that there's all the information on the logistic supply chain so they can see where the product was produced, where it was packed, where it entered the country that they're in - in our case it's China - when it was checked in our warehouse, and also they can see their own scan.""

OPEC’s decision to extend its oil supply cuts until the end of 2018 prompted a sharp rally of the commodity, while the rupee ended down at 64.46 against the dollar on fears of a wider fiscal deficit and continued FII outflows.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in her testimony before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, repeated that she anticipates the U.S. central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and trim its balance sheet. The Fed’s Beige Book economic report said the U.S. economy grew at a modest to moderate pace through mid-November as price pressures strengthened and the labour market tightened.

Back home, lower revenue collection by the government from GST was the focal point of discussion during the week. It fell to 833.46 billion rupees during in the October-November period from 921 billion rupees in September, due to lower tax rates on most commodities.

The government also attributed the lower tax collection and lesser compliance to delayed implementation of some of the main features such as invoice matching, e-way bill and reverse charge mechanism.

Most automobile companies reported strong sales growth in November on a yearly basis due to a low base, as demand was hit last year after the government’s demonetisation drive.

Seasonally, November is usually a weak month as it comes after the festive season. Sector leader Maruti Suzuki’s sales rose for the eleventh straight month, up 14.1 percent on strong demand for its compact cars like the Ignis, Baleno and Celerio. Tata Motors’ PV sales rose 35 percent to 17,157 units, led by its new compact SUV Nexon. M&M reported a 21 percent increase in PV sales at 16,030 units.

On the macro front, GDP growth rate accelerated to 6.3 percent in Q2 FY18, snapping five quarters of deceleration, on the supposed fading impact of disruptions caused by GST implementation and robust performance of manufacturing and mining sectors. One needs to see whether this is a blip or the upward movement will continue.

The RBI is likely to hold rates steady in December and February, given upside risks to inflation as well as fiscal deficit slippage, aggravated by rising oil prices and a gradual tightening of rates globally.

India’s eight core industrial output remained unchanged in October as strong growth of refinery and steel products were offset by decline in cement and natural gas.

India's fiscal deficit widened, touching 5.25 trillion rupees in October, or 96.10 percent of the budgeted target for the financial year, as input tax credit lowered revenue receipts for the government. India’s fiscal prudence may be under the scanner now.

The Nikkei India PMI for November stood at 52.6 compared with 50.3 in October. It is the strongest improvement in business conditions in 13 months and comes on back of accelerated increase in output and new orders following the lowering of GST rates.

Macro data to watch out for in the coming week include India’s Service sector PMI, which will be declared on Tuesday.

Globally, U.S. ISM non-manufacturing PMI data for November 2017 will be unveiled on Tuesday and U.S. ADP nonfarm employment change data for November 2017 will be unveiled on Wednesday. Japan’s Q3 GDP data will be unveiled on Thursday and on Friday, U.S. nonfarm payrolls data and U.S. unemployment rate data for November 2017 will be released.

Wall Street will also be reacting to ramifications of the ongoing Michael Flynn saga and the U.S. tax reform bill, which was passed by the senate. For domestic investors, the most important event to watch out for next week is the RBI rate review.

Markets will also start contemplating the outcome of the upcoming Gujarat election. The recent UP civic polls, which was swept by the BJP, will provide solace to the ruling party in Gujarat, where the Congress seems to be making some inroads.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.2 last month from 58.7 in October.

Even with the decline, the index pointed to growth ahead and was only marginally below a September reading that was the highest since May 2004. But the ISM’s employment index slipped unexpectedly to 59.7 from 59.8, which could point to less strength in manufacturing hiring this month than analysts had expected.

“(The ISM reading is) consistent with robust growth in output, exports, capital spending and employment,” said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

U.S. Treasuries yields edged down from session highs after the data, while the dollar and stocks were trading slightly higher.

Even with cooler growth in factory activity, strength in the sector as well as in the broader labor market appear likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates later this month.

A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to slip to 58.4 last month, edging lower from a surge posted after hurricanes disrupted supply chains earlier in the year.

The ISM’s new orders index rose to 64 in November from 63.4 a month earlier.

Other data on Friday showed U.S. construction spending rising more quickly than expected in October as public construction outlays surged and investment in private projects increased for the first time in four months.

The Commerce Department said that construction spending increased 1.4 percent to a record high $1.24 trillion, the swiftest advance in five months.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending to increase 0.5 percent. Construction spending increased 2.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.

Outlays on public construction projects jumped 3.9 percent, the largest gain since 2014. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 3.3 percent. Federal government construction spending soared 11.1 percent.

Construction spending outlays were revised higher for both August and September, which could affect the government’s estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth. On Wednesday, the government said in its second estimate of the economy’s July-September performance that GDP advanced 3.3 percent. Investment in both residential and non-residential structures subtracted from GDP in the quarter.","U.S. factory activity cools, with employment index edging lower",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/u-s-factory-activity-cools-with-employment-index-edging-lower-idINKBN1DV5AU

The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added.

The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N).

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

“(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.",Aetna's board set to approve $68 billion sale to CVS Health: sources,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/aetnas-board-set-to-approve-68-billion-sale-to-cvs-health-sources-idUSKBN1DX0NC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The ticking clock on the Republican Party’s efforts to cut corporate taxes, alongside the risk that the U.S. government may shut down if a budget deal isn’t reached by December 8, is increasing the levels of political risk for investors - but they have yet to really react.

“Right now the market is assuming that everything will work out, but you’ve got a tremendous number of moving parts,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors (FII.N) in New York.

Alongside the back-and-forth on taxes, Wall Street will be watching a Dec. 8 expiration date for funding needed to keep the U.S. government open alongside the deadline when the U.S. Treasury hits its limit on borrowing; as well as a Dec. 12 Special U.S. Senate election in Alabama.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned on Twitter that “I don’t see a deal” to keep the government open and work past Dec. 8, although the White House said Wednesday it did not see such an eventuality.

Typically, the threat of a government shutdown alone would prompt fund managers to move more of their assets into cash. The benchmark S&P 500 lost 2.6 percent in the eight trading days before the last government shutdown in 2013, and has declined an average of 0.6 percent during government shutdowns overall, according to LPL Financial. Debt limit concerns are likely to be put off until 2018 as the U.S. Treasury is expected to take steps to postpone any need for action by Congress.

Yet with the benchmark S&P 500 up nearly 18 percent for the year to date, some portfolio managers see a greater risk in stepping to the sidelines. Throughout the year, the stock market has rallied in the face of standoffs ranging from increasing tensions in North Korea to former FBI director’s James Comey’s testimony to Congress that President Trump fired him to undermine the agency’s Russia investigation.

On Friday, stocks sold off on a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to tell investigators that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. However, shares quickly pared those losses.

Despite his skepticism, Orlando has yet to move more of his assets to cash, in large part because corporate earnings keep rising and should continue to do so even if a tax package is not signed, he said.

If the tax bill fails, Orlando said he expected the S&P 500 to fall by as much as 10 percent. He would be a buyer in that case, he said, because he expected the S&P 500 to reach 3000 within the next 18 months.

CROWDED CALENDAR

Brian Peery, a portfolio manager at Novato, California-based Hennessy Funds (HNNA.O), said a government shutdown or the tax bill failing would prompt a swift sell-off, but that rising consumer confidence would ultimately continue to push the market higher over the next year.

“If I‘m looking at a 10 percent correction, I‘m a buyer,” he said.

The inaction is not limited to the stock market.

Christopher Ryon, a municipal bond fund manager at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, said that the Republican tax bill could reduce the size of the municipal bond market by 25 to 30 percent by limiting the ability of stadiums, airports and privately-financed toll roads to qualify for tax-exempt status.

At the same time, there could be an increased demand for municipal bonds if residents of high-tax states are no longer able to deduct their full state and local property taxes, leaving tax-free municipal bonds as one of the few ways wealthy investors can reduce their taxable incomes.

As a result, Ryon is largely sitting on his hands, ignoring both lower-rated bonds that have rallied as investors have reached for yield and triple A rated bonds that look “on the rich side,” he said.

“There are a whole lot of unintended consequences attached to this [tax] legislation,” Ryon said. “This is going to be an interesting couple of weeks where we will really see how the sausage gets made.”",Fear of missing out keeps investors in stocks despite risks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/fear-of-missing-out-keeps-investors-in-stocks-despite-risks-idUKKBN1DV5ZH

Speaking to reporters aboard the plane returning to Rome from Bangladesh, the pontiff also indicated that he had been firm with Myanmar’s military leaders in private meetings about the need for them to respect the rights of Rohingya refugees.

He also disclosed that he cried when he met a group of Rohingya refugees on Friday in Bangladesh, where he defended their rights by name in an emotional meeting.

“For me, the most important thing is that message gets through, to try to say things one step at a time and listen to the responses,” he said.

“I knew that if in the official speeches I would have used that word, they would have closed the door in our faces. But (in public) I described situations, rights, said that no one should be excluded, (the right to) citizenship, in order to allow myself to go further in the private meetings,” he said.

Francis did not use the word Rohingya in public while on the first leg of the trip in Myanmar. Predominantly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the mostly Muslim Rohingya as an ethnic group with its own identity but as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Local Roman Catholic Church authorities had advised him not to say it because it could spark a backlash against Christians and other minority groups.

The pope met Myanmar’s military leaders privately on Monday, shortly after his arrival in the nation’s biggest city, Yangon.

The meeting had been scheduled for Thursday morning but the military pointedly asked at the last minute that it be pushed forward. The result was they saw the pope before the civilian leaders instead of the other way around, as had been planned.

NON-NEGOTIABLE TRUTHS

“It was a good conversation and the truth was non-negotiable,” he said of his meeting with the military leaders.

The latest exodus from Myanmar to Bangladesh of about 625,000 people followed a Myanmar military crackdown in response to Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on Aug. 25.

Refugees have said scores of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, people were killed and women were raped. The military have denied accusations of ethnic cleansing by the United States and United Nations.

Asked if he used the word Rohingya during the private meeting with the military chiefs, the pope said: “I used words in order to arrive at the message and when I saw that the message had arrived, I dared to say everything that I wanted say”.

Slideshow (2 Images)

He then gave a reporter a mischievous grin and ended his answer with the Latin phrase “Intelligenti Pauca,” which means “Few words are enough for those who understand,” strongly hinting that he had used the word the military detests while in their presence.

Human rights groups have criticized the country’s de facto civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who was under house arrest for a total of 15 years before the 2015 elections, for not taking a stand against the generals.

But Francis, who met with her privately on Tuesday, appeared to give her the benefit of the doubt because of her delicate relationship with the generals who were once her jailers.

“Myanmar is a nation that is growing politically, in transition,” Francis said in response to a question about Suu Kyi and budding democracy in Myanmar.

“So things have to be viewed through this lens. Myanmar has to be able to look forward to the building of the country”.

On Friday in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, Francis held an emotional encounter with Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and then used the word Rohingya for the first time on the trip, although he had defended them by name twice from the Vatican earlier this year.

He told the crowd where the Rohingya were that God’s presence was within them and they should be respected.

“I was crying and tried to hide it,” Francis said on the plane, recounting how moved he felt when the refugees recounted their ordeals to him.",Pope says his defense of Rohingya got through in Myanmar,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-pope-asia/pope-says-his-defence-of-rohingya-got-through-in-myanmar-idUKKBN1DW0R5

The agreement on a range of often politically sensitive measures - covering fiscal issues, energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations - could open up fresh loans and push Greece further along the path towards a return to full market financing.

“The institutions’ visit is completed, we closed the staff level agreement,” Greece’s Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters on Saturday.

“The European institutions have reached a staff level agreement with the Greek authorities on the policy package supporting the ESM (European Stability Programme) programme,” an EU statement said later on Saturday.

The agreement between Greek officials and European Union and International Monetary Fund representatives on the country’s compliance with reforms and future commitments must be approved by euro zone finance ministers, scheduled to meet on Dec. 4.

Under the deal, Athens will need to implement a broad set of reforms as part of the so-called third review of its bailout programme.

Once concluded, the review is expected to release about five billion euros in loans from the current 86-billion-euro bailout programme, its third since 2010. EU officials said this could be done before the end of January, if all proceeded smoothly.

At least another review of agreed reforms will be necessary before the end of the programme in August.

Athens and its lenders had been exchanging drafts on agreed and proposed reforms for days. After seven years of austerity and rescue loans amounting to about 270 billion euros (238.31 billion pounds), Greece hopes its third bailout will be its last.

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile towards a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognised President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed towards the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumours.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile towards the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles towards the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile towards Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,https://in.reuters.com/article/yemen-security/saudi-led-air-strikes-support-yemens-saleh-as-he-shifts-against-houthis-idINKBN1DX0JQ

Dr. Nevio Zagaria, WHO country representative in Yemen, told Reuters that 16 percent of Yemeni children under the age of five suffer from acute malnutrition, including 5.2 percent with a severe form that is life-threatening, and the problem is increasing.

Yemen, where 8 million people face famine, is mired in a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthi armed movement and the U.S.-backed military coalition that the United Nations says has led to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Some 960,000 suspected cases of cholera and 2,219 deaths have been reported since the epidemic began in April, WHO figures show.

Children account for nearly a third of infections of the waterborne disease, spread by food or water contaminated with human feces, that causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration and can kill within hours if untreated.

Although the number of new cases has dropped for 11 straight weeks, 35 districts in Yemen are still reporting cholera with “high attack rates” in communities, Zagaria said.

A deteriorating economic situation and lack of safe drinking water, due to water sewage systems in many cities lacking fuel for the pumps, have compounded the humanitarian crisis, he said.

“This is a perfect mix to have a new explosion of a cholera epidemic at the beginning of the rainy season in March of next year,” Zagaria said in a telephone interview from Sanaa, amid four days of clashes in the capital city.

WHO is working with local authorities in both the internationally recognised government and Houthi-controlled Sana‘a to identify areas at highest risk of a spike in the cholera epidemic and to boost defences, he said.

A campaign of oral cholera vaccination - initially planned last July during an acute phase and then abandoned by authorities - is now under reconsideration but as a preventive action next year, he said.

Meanwhile, a ship carrying 35 tonnes of WHO surgical and medical supplies is being diverted to Aden after waiting weeks to offload at Hodeidah port, Zagaria said.

“We are waiting and hoping that the situation of the blockade will be resolved. We have an opening to the humanitarian blockade but the opening to the commercial blockade is only partial,” he added.

The United Nations appealed on Friday to the coalition to fully lift its blockade of Yemen, which was partially eased last week to let aid into Hodeidah and Salif, and U.N. flights into Sanaa.

The U.S.-backed military coalition closed air, land and sea access on Nov. 6 in a move it said was to stop the flow of Iranian arms to the Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen.

Aid shipments cover only a fraction of Yemen’s needs, since almost all food, fuel and medicine are commercially imported.

CONSTANT FLOW OF PATIENTS

Yemen’s health system has virtually collapsed, with most health workers unpaid for seven months.

WHO supports 130 hospitals across the country, providing fuel, water, oxygen, drugs, medical supplies and essential equipment, Zagaria said.

“The (fuel) contractors that we are working with are finding difficulty in keeping the stock,” he said, noting that some hospitals require 60,000 litres of fuel per month.

WHO runs 15 stabilisation centres for severely acute malnourished children with medical complications and is expanding with 10 more, Zagaria said.

”We see that there is a constant flow of newly admitted patients to these centres.

“The deterioration of the situation in terms of malnutrition in children is increasing... It is very difficult to quantify with precise numbers,” said Zagaria, who went to the intensive care unit of the pediatric ward in Sadaa last week.

Os políticos italianos e empresas rivais têm pedido há muito tempo que o ex-monopólio se separe e atualize sua rede, um ativo que alguns analistas têm avaliado em até 15 bilhões de euros (18 bilhões de dólares).

A pressão se intensificou desde que o grupo de mídia francês Vivendi (VIV.PA), maior acionista da Telecom Italia, com participação de 24 por cento, começou a exercer mais influência, despertando preocupações dentro do governo italiano, que considera a rede um ativo estratégico nacional.

A fonte disse que o recém-nomeado presidente-executivo Amos Genish, ex-alto executivo da Vivendi, daria uma prévia de seu plano de negócios para 2018-2020 ao conselho em 5 de dezembro.

“Como parte da apresentação, o presidente-executivo também mostrará várias opções para o futuro da rede, incluindo uma potencial cisão”, disse a fonte, falando em condição de anonimato devido à sensibilidade do assunto.

“Nenhuma decisão será tomada na terça-feira e o presidente-executivo prometerá retornar com sua recomendação para a rede em um estágio posterior”.

Uma segunda fonte próxima ao assunto disse que Genish pode receber um mandato formal pelo conselho na terça-feira para estudar possíveis desdobramentos para a rede, incluindo uma separação do resto da companhia.

Genish, ex-capitão do exército de Israel e gerente da Vivendi, tornou-se presidente-executivo da Telecom Italia em setembro, com a missão de afastar o aumento da competição na Itália, reestruturar operações no Brasil e suavizar as relações estremecidas com Roma.

Ele tem conversado com o ministro da Indústria, Carlo Calenda, o que ambos os lados descreveram como positivo. Mas a Telecom Italia está mantendo as opções abertas e o viés de centro-esquerda do governo está enfraquecido pela perspectiva de eleições nacional em maio de 2018, que as pesquisas dizem que deve resultar em um Parlamento dividido.

Genish, que apresentará seu plano de negócios no início do ano que vem, disse no mês passado que a Telecom Italia quer manter o controle de sua rede fixa, mas não precisa controlá-la inteiramente, acrescentando que a companhia tomaria uma decisão “em nossos termos, quando realmente acharmos que é necessário”.

Ele disse aos sindicatos na semana passada que do ponto de vista regulatório, a empresa não vê razões para um nível maior de separação na rede por enquanto.

The corporate tax rate in Israel is to be reduced this month from 24 to 23 percent. But a lower, more attractive, rate in the United States could lead Israeli companies to consider moving there.

“We will receive all the details from our companies abroad about the tax reform and we must address it,” Kahlon told Channel 10’s weekly politics show Hamateh. “What the danger is of companies here packing up and moving there? There are many implications. We will have to make adjustments.”

Pundits have been speculating for weeks that Coetzee would be removed after the team’s four-match European tour, and the 24-22 loss to Wales in Cardiff set off a new round of criticism in South African media on Sunday.

The coach, however, said he had no plans to go and feels his side are now on the up. “I’m signed on until 2019. That’s what my contract says,” he told reporters after South Africa finished the year with seven wins in 13 tests. Coetzee’s overall record fell to 11 wins in 25 games since his first match in charge in mid-2016. “The team has really grown. It’s a really healthy team environment. They are hurting at the moment. They feel that they let themselves down and the country down. You can only feel like that if you have a good team environment. “That wasn’t the case last year. Last year was a fiasco. Definitely a fiasco,” he added. In the wake of a dreadful set of results in 2016, which were the worst in Springbok history, Coetzee was allowed to make changes to the team set-up.

He made changes to his staff and was given more access to the players throughout the Super Rugby season. He was also allowed to set a common coaching agenda for the country’s rugby teams this year. NEW LOW Yet any signs of progress were clouded by a 57-0 loss to New Zealand that set a new low for Springbok rugby and put Coetzee’s future back in the spotlight. This was then exacerbated by a heavy defeat in Ireland last month. The coach, however, said critics were not seeing the bigger picture. “If you look at outcomes only, then you are missing the plot completely. You have to create the opportunities for guys to come in. You’ve got to give players chances to grow. You cannot build Rome in a day. “If you’re going to continue to look at the negatives, then you’ll get what you’re looking for. Then you can write what you want about that. But this side is on the up.” Some media were predicting Coetzee could be sacked as early as the end of the week with Rassie Erasmus set to take over.

Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion).

The pressure has intensified since French media group Vivendi, TIM’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

Verhofstadt and his colleagues wrote to the EU negotiators last week to sound an alarm at what they said were “stalled” talks on EU demands that the rights of EU citizens in Britain be guaranteed directly by the European Court of Justice after Britain leaves the European Union. They also voiced concern about Northern Ireland.

Parliament must ratify any treaty on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union before Brexit in March 2019 in order to create the smooth transition period May wants, and so it will be vital to both sides to keep the legislators on board.

Senior EU officials and diplomats said work was continuing on Sunday. One person close to the discussions said the situation was “delicate”. “It’s still quite fluid,” said a second person involved. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”

Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and strong critic of Brexit, declined to comment.

The German leader of the center-right group in the EU parliament warned that lawmakers were not yet satisfied.

“On Brexit negotiations, money is one of the problems, but it is not the biggest one,” Manfred Weber said in a statement. “We are much more concerned about the fact that so far negotiations are stalled on the protection of EU citizens’ rights after Brexit and on the Irish case,” he said.

The EU wants outline accords on three critical divorce terms before it will open negotiations on the transition and a future free trade pact that would follow. May’s lunch on Monday is a deadline for the EU to have her final offers before EU leaders consider whether to agree at a Dec. 15 summit to launch Phase 2.

Britain and the EU aim to sign a joint declaration setting out progress toward final deals which the Commission, as the EU executive, would say was “sufficient” for opening trade talks.

EU officials say terms have been agreed for a financial settlement long resisted by hardline supporters of Brexit. The Irish prime minister said on Saturday that would essentially cover all the 60 billion euros the EU had demanded.

On the second key issue of a deal to avoid a “hard border” on land between Britain and the EU across the island of Ireland, diplomats say the joint document will set out rules for reaching a border deal aimed at avoiding disruption to peace in the north but leaving open many of the details.

CITIZENS’ RIGHTS

The third issue, of citizens’ rights, has long seemed the least problematic, but the European Parliament’s concerns were a reminder of how far the insistence on the ECJ having the final say in whether London was respecting the withdrawal treaty conflicts with British demands to be free of EU courts.

It was not immediately clear what compromise, if any, has been found. EU governments had also been pressing London to give better terms to EU expatriates on bringing in future family members and on moving social welfare benefits across borders.

One suggestion in Brussels has been to limit clearly any ECJ involvement as a last resort and clearly only available to those EU citizens who choose to go on living in Britain before Brexit, not to any who arrive later. There are 3 million of them today.

Looking to show skeptical pro-Brexit allies that she has secured something in five months of negotiation that seem set to end with London broadly accepting the EU’s original terms, May has insisted that Brussels make a simultaneous and reciprocal commitment to transition and trade talks if she accepts a deal.

That seems set to be the case with the joint declaration.

“Everyone knows we have to honor politically what the Brits have accepted on money,” a senior EU diplomat said. “So on Monday they will sign this document.”

If all goes to the plan, 27 EU leaders would give the official green light on Dec. 15, a day after May has joined them for a routine summit on other EU business..

The deliberately vague concept of “sufficient progress” gives the political leaders the option to leave plenty of room for future negotiation. The key thing for many in Brussels is that it should mark the establishment of trust that both sides are willing to work for a separation that is not too disruptive.","As Brexit deal takes shape, Juncker to meet MEPs",https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-juncker-parliament/as-brexit-deal-takes-shape-juncker-to-meet-meps-idINKBN1DX0AI?il=0

West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.

The accelerated pace of North Korea’s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.

On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday.

Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.

“It’s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,” the Alabama Congressman and Republican told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California.

When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill‎ said in a statement: “The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.”

The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department.

Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are “competing” for the missile defense installations.

Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites.

The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined.

THAAD is a ground-based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install.

In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed.

A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company “is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.” He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision.

In July, the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The successful test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military’s missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures.

Currently, the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD) in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships. The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD.

The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

North Korea’s latest missile test puts the U.S. capital within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday.",Exclusive: Pentagon evaluating U.S. West Coast missile defense sites - officials,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DX04N

Dr. Nevio Zagaria, WHO country representative in Yemen, told Reuters that 16 percent of Yemeni children under the age of five suffer from acute malnutrition, including 5.2 percent with a severe form that is life-threatening, and the problem is increasing.

Yemen, where 8 million people face famine, is mired in a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthi armed movement and the U.S.-backed military coalition that the United Nations says has led to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Some 960,000 suspected cases of cholera and 2,219 deaths have been reported since the epidemic began in April, WHO figures show.

Children account for nearly a third of infections of the waterborne disease, spread by food or water contaminated with human feces, that causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration and can kill within hours if untreated.

Although the number of new cases has dropped for 11 straight weeks, 35 districts in Yemen are still reporting cholera with “high attack rates” in communities, Zagaria said.

A deteriorating economic situation and lack of safe drinking water, due to water sewage systems in many cities lacking fuel for the pumps, have compounded the humanitarian crisis, he said.

“This is a perfect mix to have a new explosion of a cholera epidemic at the beginning of the rainy season in March of next year,” Zagaria said in a telephone interview from Sanaa, amid four days of clashes in the capital city.

WHO is working with local authorities in both the internationally recognized government and Houthi-controlled Sana‘a to identify areas at highest risk of a spike in the cholera epidemic and to boost defences, he said.

A campaign of oral cholera vaccination - initially planned last July during an acute phase and then abandoned by authorities - is now under reconsideration but as a preventive action next year, he said.

Meanwhile, a ship carrying 35 tonnes of WHO surgical and medical supplies is being diverted to Aden after waiting weeks to offload at Hodeidah port, Zagaria said.

“We are waiting and hoping that the situation of the blockade will be resolved. We have an opening to the humanitarian blockade but the opening to the commercial blockade is only partial,” he added.

The United Nations appealed on Friday to the coalition to fully lift its blockade of Yemen, which was partially eased last week to let aid into Hodeidah and Salif, and U.N. flights into Sanaa.

The U.S.-backed military coalition closed air, land and sea access on Nov. 6 in a move it said was to stop the flow of Iranian arms to the Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen.

Aid shipments cover only a fraction of Yemen’s needs, since almost all food, fuel and medicine are commercially imported.

CONSTANT FLOW OF PATIENTS

Yemen’s health system has virtually collapsed, with most health workers unpaid for seven months.

WHO supports 130 hospitals across the country, providing fuel, water, oxygen, drugs, medical supplies and essential equipment, Zagaria said.

“The (fuel) contractors that we are working with are finding difficulty in keeping the stock,” he said, noting that some hospitals require 60,000 liters of fuel per month.

WHO runs 15 stabilization centers for severely acute malnourished children with medical complications and is expanding with 10 more, Zagaria said.

”We see that there is a constant flow of newly admitted patients to these centers.

“The deterioration of the situation in terms of malnutrition in children is increasing... It is very difficult to quantify with precise numbers,” said Zagaria, who went to the intensive care unit of the pediatric ward in Sadaa last week.

“I am a pediatrician, I worked many years in Africa. You don’t need to take the weight and the height.”","Cholera could resurge in Yemen due to lack of aid, fuel: WHO",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-health/cholera-could-resurge-in-yemen-due-to-lack-of-aid-fuel-who-idUSKBN1DX0J9?il=0

Fisher had filmed all of her scenes for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the eighth installment of the blockbuster space saga, before she died of a heart attack in December 2016.

“She’s irreplaceable,” Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, told Reuters. “‘Star Wars’ is about great triumphs and great tragedies, and I can’t think of a bigger tragedy than missing our Leia,” Hamill told Reuters.

Writer and director Rian Johnson said he did not change Leia’s story in “Last Jedi” after her death. The film debuts in theaters December 14.

It will be up to the makers of 2019 film “Episode IX” to decide the ultimate fate of the character first seen as a spunky princess in the original 1977 “Star Wars” film, Johnson added.

In “The Last Jedi,” “we didn’t tailor it to be a farewell to her,” Johnson said. “But, that having been said, I think there’s some moments that I think will really mean a lot to fans. You will see more from Leia that you haven’t seen before.”

Fisher’s final film appearance is expected to boost already feverish interest in the franchise, now owned by Walt Disney Co. Boxoffice.com projects “Last Jedi” will haul in $185 million to $215 million at U.S. and Canadian ticket windows its first weekend, which would rank as one of the biggest film debuts in history.

The cast and director provided few details about the film’s plot. John Boyega, who portrays former Stormtrooper Finn, said the movie finds Leia, now a general, leading the Resistance against the evil First Order during a tense time in the raging battle to protect the galaxy far, far away.

“There is a lot of pressure on the Resistance, and General Leia is on the front lines having to make big decisions,” Boyega said. “It’s a performance that requires a heartfelt approach, and she definitely had that.”

Oscar Isaac, who plays Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, said the time in Leia’s life mirrored Fisher’s in some ways.

Leia understands “she’s not going to be around forever, and there is a passing of the torch that needs to happen,” Isaac said. “She wants to give over as much of her wisdom as she can before this moment happens.”

Fisher, however, would not want fans to get too sentimental, Hamill said.

“I do know her well enough to say that she would want us to be laughing and even mocking her,” Hamill said.

“She was irreverent, she was cynical, and she was bitterly funny and caustic and all these things. But she was always fun to be around,” he added.",Leia leads resistance in Carrie Fisher's final 'Star Wars' film,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1DX02H-OCAEN

In a speech on Saturday, Saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists’ alliance with Houthi fighters. He said he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens and lifted a siege.

Residents on Sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 Yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of Saada, the home territory of the Houthis. The attack could not be verified.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television said on Sunday coalition aircraft pounded Houthi outposts in southern Sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties.

Separately, the Houthis, who together with Saleh’s loyalists, control most of northern Yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a report quickly denied by the UAE.

Saleh’s announcement on Saturday was welcomed by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the United States and other Western powers.

The coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, is trying to help Yemen’s internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against Houthi-Saleh forces. A split between Saleh’s armed allies and the Houthis could tip the balance of power.

Army units loyal to Saleh have been clashing with Houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in Yemen.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash appeared to back Saleh’s side in remarks on his official Twitter page.

“The events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion,” he said.

Residents in Sanaa reported on Sunday that the Houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to Saleh over the previous four days, and Houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city’s central Political District.

The area is a stronghold of Saleh’s loyalists under the command of his nephew Tareq, an influential army general.

The fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the United Nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from Sanaa, according to U.N. and other aid officials. The U.N. was awaiting approval from the Saudi-led coalition, they said.

Residents earlier said Houthi fighters seized the television studios of Yemen Today, a news channel owned by Saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. Residents said 20 employees were trapped inside.

The Red Cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared.

In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called for calm and restraint. “All internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the Yemeni nation,” he said, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, and the proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times.

More than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. Famine threatens much of the country.

Yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the Houthis, a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shi‘ite Islam, marched on Sanaa and seized control of the government.

Backed by government troops loyal to Saleh, the Houthis fanned out across the country, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. His ouster led the alliance headed by the Saudis to join the fighting.

HOUTHIS CLAIM MISSILE FIRED TOWARD UAE

The Houthis said the missile fired on Sunday was directed toward the al-Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack.

There were no reports of any missiles reaching Abu Dhabi. The country’s crisis management authority said the al-Barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors.

“The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in Yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the United Arab Emirates,” the department said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

It said the nuclear power project was “fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. And enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require”.

The Houthis had said Abu Dhabi, a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles.

The Barakah project, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) (015760.KS), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the UAE energy minister has said.

It is the second time this year the Houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the UAE. A few months ago, they said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the UAE.",Saudi-led air strikes support Yemen's Saleh as he shifts against Houthis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/saudi-led-air-strikes-back-yemens-saleh-in-houthi-clashes-idUSKBN1DX07O

Most Zimbabweans remember Moyo as the khaki-clad general who went on state television in the early hours of Nov. 15 to announce the military takeover that ended Mugabe’s 37-year rule.

Sworn in as president a week ago after 93-year-old Mugabe quit in the wake of a de facto military coup, Mnangagwa made Major-General Sibusiso Moyo foreign minister and handed Air Marshal Perrance Shiri the sensitive land portfolio.

The new president, who later on Friday spoke publicly about the need to draw on local expertise and skills to put the economy back on robust footing, also brought back Patrick Chinamasa as finance minister despite his chequered record in that post previously.

Most Zimbabweans remember Moyo as the khaki-clad general who went on state television in the early hours of Nov. 15 to announce the military takeover that ended Mugabe’s 37-year rule.

Shiri is feared - and loathed - by many Zimbabweans as the former commander of the North Korean-trained ‘5 Brigade’ that played a central role in the so-called Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland in 1983 in which an estimated 20,000 people were killed.

The land portfolio is a sensitive but economically crucial one since land reforms in the early 2000s led to violent seizure of thousands of white-owned farms and the collapse of the nation’s economy.

“For most observers, this (the new cabinet line-up) looks like a reward for the military - or more specifically like the military asserting its authority,” London-based political analyst Alex Magaisa wrote on Twitter.

Mnangagwa, a former state security chief known as ‘The Crocodile’, dropped allies of Mugabe’s wife, Grace, but brought back many Mugabe loyalists from the ruling ZANU-PF party, disappointing those who had been expecting a break with the past.

“Zimbabweans were expecting a sea change from the Mugabe era. After all, had there not been a revolution, or so they thought?” Magaisa said.

New information minister Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of the powerful liberation war veterans, was not immediately available for comment.

OLD WINE

“Even #Nigeria didn’t have so many commanders in Cabinet in its coup days!” former information minister and G40 leader Jonathan Moyo, who remains in hiding, said on Twitter.

Chinamasa, a lawyer by training, had been finance minister since 2013 until he was shifted to the new ministry of cyber security in a reshuffle this year.

His predecessor and Mugabe ally Ignatius Chombo, is in jail facing corruption charges dating back more than two decades. A high court on Friday postponed Chombo’s hearing to next Tuesday.

During Chinamasa’s time in charge, though, the economy stagnated, with a lack of exports causing acute dollars shortages that crippled the financial system and led to long queues outside banks.

The issuance of billions of dollars of domestic debt to pay for a bloated civil service - a key component of the ZANU-PF patronage machine under Mugabe - also triggered a collapse in the value of Zimbabwe’s de facto currency and ignited inflation.

“I had expected a more broad-based cabinet,” said economist Anthony Hawkins, adding that Mnangagwa’s faith in Chinamasa suggested loyalty trumped ability. “Chinamasa’s appointment was to be expected, notwithstanding his appalling record.”

With elections due next year, Mnangagwa needs to deliver a quick economic bounce and has made clear he wants to curb wasteful expenditure. His cabinet has 22 ministers compared to Mugabe’s 33.

One of his most pressing tasks will be to patch up relations with donors and the outside world and work out a deal to clear Zimbabwe’s $1.8 billion of arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank.

Without that, the new administration will be unable to unlock any new external financing.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told Reuters this week London was thinking about extending a bridging loan to Harare to allow this to happen, although said it depended on “how the democratic process unfolds”.

Speaking publicly for the first time as president at a graduation ceremony at a university in Chinhoyi, 110 km (68 miles) south of Harare, Mnangagwa, however, appeared to be looking to local expertise to put the economy on a stronger footing.

“As we engage the world it is of great importance to have our own home-grown solutions to develop our economy and benchmark ourselves on the best in the global village,” he said.",Zimbabwe's military muscles into first post-Mugabe cabinet,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DV4BJ-OZATP

“There’s not going to be a government shutdown,” McConnell told ABC’s “This Week” program. “It’s just not going to happen.”

As tensions rise between the two parties over the spending bill, McConnell called the Democrats’ position “untenable,” saying Congress has until March to address the status of so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill.

But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown.

“That’s a ridiculous position,” McConnell told ABC.

Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill.

In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution.

“I don’t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,” McConnell said. “That’s a very untenable position.”

Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject.

The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State with Washington’s backing. The SDF offensive in Deir al-Zor province, which borders Iraq, has focused on territory east of the Euphrates river.

On the western bank, the Syrian military has waged its own attack against Islamic State with support from Iran-backed militias and Russia.

The separate assaults advanced from opposite sides of the river, which bisects oil-rich Deir al-Zor, mostly staying out of each other’s way. The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have held deconfliction meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict.

The SDF’s most powerful component, the YPG, announced that it had defeated Islamic State militants on its side “in cooperation with the Arab tribes.”

The U.S.-led coalition and Russian forces in Syria provided “air and logistical support, advice and coordination on the ground,” its statement said. “We hope for an increase in this support and for ensuring the necessary air cover.”

A YPG spokesman declared the victory in a village in Deir al-Zor in the presence of a Russian envoy from Moscow’s Hmeimim military base in Syria, it said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this week that as the battle against Islamic State entered its final stages, he expected the focus to move toward holding territory instead of arming Syrian Kurdish fighters.

Washington’s support for the YPG has infuriated Turkey, which sees the growing influence of Kurdish forces on its border as a security threat. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) movement, which has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.

Since the start of Syria’s conflict in 2011, the YPG and its allies have carved out autonomous regions in the north. They now control around a quarter of Syria, the largest part outside government control, after seizing vast land from Islamic State.

Their autonomy plans face opposition from their battlefield ally Washington, from Turkey and from the Syrian government.

The YPG said on Sunday it was forming civil councils for Deir al-Zor that include Kurds, Arabs and other components based on “the principle of democracy and self-rule.” It would mirror governing arrangements in other towns and cities that the Kurdish fighters and their allies captured.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

However, EU officials and diplomats cautioned on Sunday that it was still unclear that a deal would be struck with the British prime minister when she meets the EU executive.

Two hours before they sit down for lunch with May in Brussels, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will brief Guy Verhofstadt and his European Parliament Brexit team, an official said.

Verhofstadt and his colleagues wrote to the EU negotiators last week to sound an alarm at what they said were “stalled” talks on EU demands that the rights of EU citizens in Britain be guaranteed directly by the European Court of Justice after Britain leaves the European Union. They also voiced concern about Northern Ireland.

Parliament must ratify any treaty on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union before Brexit in March 2019 in order to create the smooth transition period May wants, and so it will be vital to both sides to keep the legislators on board.

Senior EU officials and diplomats said work was continuing on Sunday. One person close to the discussions said the situation was “delicate”. “It’s still quite fluid,” said a second person involved. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”

Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and strong critic of Brexit, declined to comment.

The German leader of the center-right group in the EU parliament warned that lawmakers were not yet satisfied.

“On Brexit negotiations, money is one of the problems, but it is not the biggest one,” Manfred Weber said in a statement. “We are much more concerned about the fact that so far negotiations are stalled on the protection of EU citizens’ rights after Brexit and on the Irish case,” he said.

The EU wants outline accords on three critical divorce terms before it will open negotiations on the transition and a future free trade pact that would follow. May’s lunch on Monday is a deadline for the EU to have her final offers before EU leaders consider whether to agree at a Dec. 15 summit to launch Phase 2.

Britain and the EU aim to sign a joint declaration setting out progress toward final deals which the Commission, as the EU executive, would say was “sufficient” for opening trade talks.

EU officials say terms have been agreed for a financial settlement long resisted by hardline supporters of Brexit. The Irish prime minister said on Saturday that would essentially cover all the 60 billion euros the EU had demanded.

On the second key issue of a deal to avoid a “hard border” on land between Britain and the EU across the island of Ireland, diplomats say the joint document will set out rules for reaching a border deal aimed at avoiding disruption to peace in the north but leaving open many of the details.

CITIZENS’ RIGHTS

The third issue, of citizens’ rights, has long seemed the least problematic, but the European Parliament’s concerns were a reminder of how far the insistence on the ECJ having the final say in whether London was respecting the withdrawal treaty conflicts with British demands to be free of EU courts.

It was not immediately clear what compromise, if any, has been found. EU governments had also been pressing London to give better terms to EU expatriates on bringing in future family members and on moving social welfare benefits across borders.

One suggestion in Brussels has been to limit clearly any ECJ involvement as a last resort and clearly only available to those EU citizens who choose to go on living in Britain before Brexit, not to any who arrive later. There are 3 million of them today.

Looking to show skeptical pro-Brexit allies that she has secured something in five months of negotiation that seem set to end with London broadly accepting the EU’s original terms, May has insisted that Brussels make a simultaneous and reciprocal commitment to transition and trade talks if she accepts a deal.

That seems set to be the case with the joint declaration.

“Everyone knows we have to honor politically what the Brits have accepted on money,” a senior EU diplomat said. “So on Monday they will sign this document.”

If all goes to the plan, 27 EU leaders would give the official green light on Dec. 15, a day after May has joined them for a routine summit on other EU business..

The deliberately vague concept of “sufficient progress” gives the political leaders the option to leave plenty of room for future negotiation. The key thing for many in Brussels is that it should mark the establishment of trust that both sides are willing to work for a separation that is not too disruptive.","As Brexit deal takes shape, Juncker to meet MEPs",https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-juncker-parliament/as-brexit-deal-takes-shape-juncker-to-meet-meps-idINKBN1DX0AI

Xi’s comments were read by Huang Kunming, head of the Chinese Communist Party’s publicity department at the country’s largest public cyber policy forum in the town of Wuzhen in eastern China.

“The development of China’s cyberspace is entering a fast lane...China’s doors will only become more and more open,” said Xi in the note.

Cyber sovereignty is the idea that states should be permitted to manage and contain their own internet without external interference.

China’s Communist Party has tightened cyber regulation in the past year, formalizing new rules that require firms to store data locally and censor tools that allow users to subvert the Great Firewall.

In June, China introduced a new national cybersecurity law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures.

Cyber regulators say the laws are in line with international rules, and that they are designed to protect personal privacy and counter attacks on core infrastructure. Business groups say the rules unfairly target foreign firms.

China has advocated strongly for a larger role in global internet governance under Xi.

The tourists, who sent the Australians in to bat after winning the toss on Saturday, had made 29 for one in reply when rain brought a premature end to the day’s play at Adelaide Oval.

It looked like something of a reprieve for England, who had already lost Mark Stoneman for 18 to leave Alastair Cook, unbeaten on 11, and James Vince, yet to score, facing a night assault from Australia’s pace battery.

Marsh had earlier put the hosts on the front foot with his fifth test century, a 231-ball vindication of the decision by the Australian selectors to hand the 34-year-old his eighth test recall.

”We knew if we could bat for most of the day and put them in under lights we’d be a chance,“ Marsh told reporters. ”To be nice and patient, and get a hundred there at the end was pleasing.

“It’s great to be playing for Australia and just to be out there in the middle.”

Marsh had to grit it out at times as England produced a much improved bowling performance after a disappointing day one and had the Decision Review System (DRS) to thank for a life after initially being given out lbw to James Anderson on 29.

Tim Paine, who joined Marsh at the crease when Stuart Broad dismissed Peter Handscomb lbw with the third delivery of the day, was similarly reprieved when tracking showed an Anderson delivery would have gone over the stumps.

Marsh put on 85 with Paine as the two most controversial selections in the Australia squad for the first two tests frustrated England before the wicketkeeper holed out for 57 -- a third test half century coming seven years after his second.

DROPPED CATCH

The left-hander then put together a stand of 99 with Pat Cummins, reaching the hundred mark in the process with a sumptuous pull off a Chris Woakes delivery which raced to the square leg boundary for his 12th four.

The batsman whipped off his helmet to acknowledge the applause of another bumper crowd at the Adelaide Oval and almost immediately had another reprieve when Cook and James Vince collided in the gully with neither able to take a simple catch.

If much of Marsh’s progress to the century had been a stop-start affair, there was nothing cautious about the way he punished the tourists for their profligacy after the break as Steve Smith pondered the declaration.

With Cummins initially providing back-up with his highest test score, a seven-boundary 44, Marsh added three more fours and a punishing straight six off Broad to finish unbeaten on 126 when Smith finally called him in.

“Some days it goes your ways and some it doesn‘t,” England coach Trevor Bayliss said.

“There’s a good feeling in the dressing room. They’re certainly not disheartened at all. Shaun showed it’s not impossible to score runs out there. It will be up to one of our guys to go out and make a bit score, not just 40 or 50.”

England, already 1-0 down in the five-match series after a 10-wicket loss in Brisbane last week, made a reasonable start before Mitchell Starc sent down a fizzing yorker that trapped Stoneman in front.

To add insult to injury on a day when the DRS had worked so well for Australia, Stoneman referred the decision, only for the tracking to show the ball would have clattered into his leg stump.",Cricket: Marsh century puts Australia in charge in Adelaide,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-ashes/cricket-marsh-century-puts-australia-in-charge-in-adelaide-idINKBN1DX06B

“There’s not going to be a government shutdown,” McConnell told ABC’s “This Week” program. “It’s just not going to happen.”

As tensions rise between the two parties over the spending bill, McConnell called the Democrats’ position “untenable,” saying Congress has until March to address the status of so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill.

But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown.

“That’s a ridiculous position,” McConnell told ABC.

Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill.

In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution.

“I don’t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,” McConnell said. “That’s a very untenable position.”

Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject.

'.”Neil Barnas, a USAF major who last year wrote a thesis on the potential of blockchain in defense, said U.S. military and security agencies were slowly waking up.","(Reuters) - Police and security agencies have so far only taken an interest in blockchain - the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin - for tracking criminals hiding illegal money from banks.

But that’s changing as some civilian, police and military agencies see blockchain as a potential solution to problems they have wrestled with for years: how to secure data, but also be able to share it in a way that lets the owner keep control.

Australia, for example, has recently hired HoustonKemp, a Singapore-based consultancy, to build a blockchain-based system to record intelligence created by investigators and others, and improve the way important information is shared.

“They’ve been trying for years to come up with a centralized platform, but people are reluctant to share information,” said Adrian Kemp, who runs the consultancy, which was awarded a A$1 million ($757,500) grant by AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.

Blockchain’s appeal for data sharing is threefold.

Its ledger, or database, is not controlled by any single party and is spread across multiple computers, making it hard to break. Once entered, any information cannot be altered or tampered with. And, by using so-called smart contracts, the owner of information can easily tweak who has access to what.

It’s a sign of how far blockchain technology has come within a decade since the publication of a pseudonymous paper describing bitcoin and the blockchain ledger that would record transactions in it.

Bitcoin has since become the preferred currency not only of libertarians and speculators, but also of criminal hackers. The bitcoin price is volatile, and hit record peaks late last month.

Governments are already exploring ways to store some data, such as land records, contracts and assets, in blockchains, and the financial industry, too, has experimented with blockchain technologies to streamline transactions and back-office systems, though with limited success.

SECURING SHARED DATA

The closest most law enforcement agencies have come to the blockchain has been working with start-up firms to analyze it for evidence of criminal deals.

But in the past year or so that attitude has begun to change.

The United States Air Force (USAF) has funded research into how blockchain could ensure its data isn’t changed. In May, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded a grant to the company behind an encrypted chat program to make a secure messaging service based on the blockchain.

Amendments to a recent U.S. Senate defense bill require the government to report back on “the potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies” and how foreign governments, extremists and criminals might be using them.

Britain, too, is exploring several uses of the blockchain, say consultants and companies working for several departments.

Cambridge Consultants, a UK-based consultancy, said it had worked with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, a UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) agency, on using a blockchain to improve the trustworthiness of a network of sensors on, for example, security cameras.

The UK’s justice ministry is looking at proving that evidence - video, emails, documents - hasn’t been tampered with by registering it all on a blockchain, according to a blog post on its website.

Marcus Ralphs, a former soldier and now CEO of ByzGen Ltd, which makes blockchains for the security sector, said he was working on projects with the MoD using blockchain to track the status and level of individuals’ security clearance. Other work included helping the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) improve the way work permits are issued and records stored.

“PASSING THE BUCK”

Adrian Kemp of HoustonKemp Economists speaks to Reuters in their office in Singapore November 24, 2017. Picture taken November 24, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su

These are early days.

Kemp says there’s no guarantee his project will be deployed more widely. And some who have worked with AUSTRAC are skeptical, saying such projects have more to do with agencies turning to the private sector because they’re running low on resources and ideas.

“The government is just looking to pass the buck on to private industry,” said Simon Smith, a cyber private investigator who has worked on cases involving AUSTRAC.

Many police forces and armies aren’t ready for the technological and mental leap necessary.

The Police Foundation, a UK think-tank focusing on policing and crime, is pushing British police to explore the blockchain, but its director, Rick Muir, said “we are still at the stage of ‘what is blockchain?'.”

Neil Barnas, a USAF major who last year wrote a thesis on the potential of blockchain in defense, said U.S. military and security agencies were slowly waking up.

The problem, he says, is that military minds are more inclined towards centralized systems than the decentralized ones that blockchain’s distributed ledger embraces.

That said, blockchain’s association with the criminal underworld has not dented its appeal to those who see its potential, said ByzGen’s Ralphs.

“The negative narrative around it has not at all watered down or diluted interest of the people we’ve been engaging with,” he said.

Italian politicians and rival firms have long called on the former monopoly to separate and upgrade its network, an asset some analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($18 billion).

The pressure has intensified since French media group Vivendi, TIM’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, began to exert greater influence, raising concerns within the Italian government, which considers the network a strategic national asset.

The source said recently appointed CEO Amos Genish, a former Vivendi top executive, would give an outline of his 2018-2020 business plan to the board on Dec. 5.

“As part of that presentation the CEO will also present the various options for the future of the network, including a potential separation,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“No decision will be taken on Tuesday and the CEO will promise to come back with his recommendation for the network at a later stage.”

A second source close to the matter said Genish could be given a formal mandate by the board on Tuesday to study possible developments for the network, including a separation from the rest of the company.

Genish, formerly an Israeli army captain and Vivendi manager, became TIM’s boss in September, with a mission to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and smooth strained relations with Rome.

He has held talks with Industry Minister Carlo Calenda which both sides described as positive. But TIM is keeping its options open and the center-left government’s hand is weakened by the prospect of national elections due by May 2018 which polls say are likely to result in a hung parliament.

Genish, who will present his business plan early next year, said last month TIM wanted to keep control of its fixed network but didn’t need to own it in full, adding the company would make a decision “on our terms when we really believe it’s needed.”

He told unions last week that from a regulatory point of view the company did not see any reasons for a greater degree of separation of the network for now.

With Benevento having lost their first 14 top flight matches, the result was another deep embarrassment to big-spending AC Milan who were playing their first match under new coach Gennaro Gattuso, their fiery former midfielder, after sacking Vincenzo Montella on Monday.

In a later game, Ivan Perisic scored a hat-trick to lead unbeaten Inter Milan to a 5-0 win over Chievo which took them top of the table, overhauling Napoli who lost 1-0 at home to Juventus on Friday.

AC Milan, who spent over 200 million euros ($237.78 million) in the summer transfer market compared to Benevento’s total of 20 million, twice led but were pegged back after Alessio Romagnoli was sent off for a second booking in the 75th minute.

Brignoli went up to join the attack after his side won a free kick in the fifth minute of stoppage time and, as Danilo Cataldi whipped the ball in, he met it with a flying header into the bottom corner of the net to spark wild scenes at the modest Stadio Ciro Vigorito.

The 26-year-old became the first goalkeeper to score in Serie A since Massimo Taibi for Reggina in 2001.

“There was nothing to lose. I just closed my eyes and jumped. It was a goalkeeper’s goal, not a forward’s goal,” he said.

A bemused Gattuso said: “It hurts. A knife wound would have been less painful than that goal. I would never have expected to concede a goal in the last minute with the opposition goalkeeper scoring.”

Serie A debutants Benevento should have gone ahead just after the half hour but Vittorio Parigini sent a free header wide from Marco D‘Alessandro’s cross.

Instead, they found themselves a goal behind when Giacomo Bonaventura headed in at the far post after Benevento missed several chances to clear the danger.

George Puscas snapped up a rebound to give Benevento an equaliser five minutes after halftime but, as so often this season, they undid the good work by quickly conceding another, Nikola Kalinic scoring after being allowed a free header.

Milan, however, handed the initiative to Benevento as the pressure grew after Romagnoli was harshly sent off for a tackle on Gaetano Letizia, even though no contact seemed to be made.

The hosts attacked desperately but were finally rewarded with Brignoli’s stunning effort on a memorable afternoon.

Inter survived an early scare, when goalkeeper Samir Handanovic parried Riccardo Meggiorini’s header from close range, before running riot at the San Siro.

A Perisic volley and Mauro Icardi’s 16th league goal of the season put them in control at halftime while Milan Skriniar was on target in the second half with Perisic scoring the other two.

Inter lead with 39 points from 15 games, followed by Napoli on 38, Juventus on 37 and AS Roma on 34 with a game in hand.

Fiorentina drew level on 21 points with Milan in seventh place thanks to a 3-0 win over lowly Sassuolo.

The new offerings will enable AWS customers to develop and quickly “train” their own artificial intelligence algorithms, build software applications capable of translating language on the fly, analyze video, and scan text for trends or key phrases.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines carrying out tasks that are normally associated with human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI in which sophisticated computer algorithms are developed to recognize patterns in large volumes of data to solve problems on their own.

For example, with two of the new AWS features a company could quickly transcribe customer phone calls and then analyze the text for customer sentiment.

Already Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, Amazon and other top tech companies are developing and using AI for their own products, but the new offerings from AWS could make it easier and more affordable for startups and less tech-savvy enterprises to implement AI technology.

The product announcements, made at AWS’s annual conference in Las Vegas, cap off a year in which Amazon released 1,300 new AWS features, up from a little more than 1,000 in 2016.

“As always, Amazon is making it easier for companies to get started using new technologies,” said Mikhail Naumov, co-founder of DigitalGenius, a London-based customer service startup that uses AI. “Now they are making it easier for companies of all sizes to leverage powerful ML tools in their business.”

Despite being the pioneer and dominant player in the cloud computing market, AWS is playing catch-up to chief rivals Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google when it comes to new AI offerings, several of which will not be generally available until sometime in 2018.

Microsoft, for example, offered Translator, a direct competitor to the new Amazon Translate, as far back as 2011, Microsoft said. And Google Cloud Platform introduced the Google Natural Language API, a rival to the new Amazon Comprehend, last November. Throughout 2017 both Microsoft and Google announced AI services that rival those unveiled this week by AWS.

“If Amazon can offer products that are just good enough, it can use its leading position,” said Chris Nicholson, CEO of Skymind, a San Francisco startup that provides AI solutions for enterprises.

Among Amazon’s AI announcements is Amazon SageMaker, which lets companies build and quickly train machine learning algorithms. It also announced Amazon Rekognition Video, which uses AI to detect objects and faces in customers’ video content; Amazon Transcribe, which turns audio into text; Amazon Translate, which translates text; and Amazon Comprehend, which analyzes text for sentiment and key phrases.

”We expect the big three to continue to play a game of leapfrog over the next several years as the enterprise moves from experimental to industrialization of AI and machine learning,“ said Ken Corless, a principal in Deloitte Consulting’s cloud engineering practice. ”Given their market share, AWS’s announcements are significant as they are signaling to the market that they will not cede this space to Microsoft or Google.”",Amazon steps up pace in artificial intelligence race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-reinvent-ai/amazon-steps-up-pace-in-artificial-intelligence-race-idUSKBN1DV3CZ

No entanto, funcionários e diplomatas da UE alertaram no domingo que ainda não estava claro se seria alcançado um acordo com a primeira-ministra britânica em seu encontro com o Executivo da UE.

Duas horas antes de se sentarem para almoçar com May em Bruxelas, o presidente da Comissão, Jean-Claude Juncker, e seu negociador para o Brexit, Michel Barnier, se reunirão com Guy Verhofstadt e sua equipe do Brexit no Parlamento Europeu, disse uma autoridade.

Verhofstadt e seus colegas escreveram aos negociadores da UE na semana passada para alertar para o que disseram ser negociações “estagnadas” sobre as exigências da UE de que os direitos dos cidadãos da UE no Reino Unido sejam garantidos diretamente pelo Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia após o Reino Unido deixar o bloco. Eles também expressaram preocupação com a Irlanda do Norte.

O Parlamento europeu deve ratificar qualquer tratado sobre a saída do Reino Unido da União Européia antes do Brexit, em março de 2019, para criar o período de transição suave que May deseja, e desta forma será vital para ambos os lados manter os parlamentares a bordo

Autoridades da UE e diplomatas disseram que o trabalho continuava neste domingo. Uma pessoa próxima às discussões disse que a situação era “delicada”. Verhofstadt, ex-primeiro-ministro belga e forte crítico do Brexit, não quis comentar.

“Ainda é bastante fluido”, disse uma segunda pessoa envolvida. “Nada existe nenhum acordo até que tudo esteja de acordo”.

A UE quer acordos gerais sobre três termos críticos da saída antes de abrir negociações sobre a transição e um futuro pacto comercial que aconteceria posteriormente. O almoço de May na segunda-feira é o prazo para a UE ter as ofertas finais da primeira-ministra antes que os líderes da UE considerem se concordarão em uma cúpula de 15 de dezembro para lançar a fase dois.

O Reino Unido e a UE pretendem assinar uma declaração conjunta que estabelece progresso em direção a acordos finais que a Comissão, como Executivo da UE, considerarão “suficientes” para a abertura de negociações comerciais.

As autoridades da UE dizem que já foram combinados os termos para um acordo financeiro que os adeptos do Brexit linha dura resistem há muito tempo. O primeiro-ministro irlandês disse no sábado que abrangeria essencialmente todos os 60 bilhões de euros exigidos pela UE.

Em relação à segunda questão fundamental para um acordo para evitar uma “fronteira dura” terrestre entre o Reino Unido e a UE em toda a ilha da Irlanda, os diplomatas afirmam que o documento conjunto estabelecerá regras para alcançar um acordo de fronteira destinado a evitar a ruptura da paz no norte, mas deixando muitos detalhes em aberto.

A terceira questão, dos direitos dos cidadãos, por muito tempo pareceu ser a menos problemática, mas as preocupações do Parlamento Europeu na semana passada foram uma lembrança de quão longe a insistência no Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia em ter a palavra final em Londres respeitava os conflitos sobre os tratados de retirada com as demandas britânicas para ser livre de tribunais da UE.

Não ficou imediatamente claro se foi atingido um meio-termo.

“There’s not going to be a government shutdown,” McConnell told ABC’s “This Week” program. “It’s just not going to happen.”

As tensions rise between the two parties over the spending bill, McConnell called the Democrats’ position “untenable,” saying Congress has until March to address the status of so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill.

But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown.

“That’s a ridiculous position,” McConnell told ABC.

Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill.

In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution.

“I don’t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,” McConnell said. “That’s a very untenable position.”

Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject.

The International Court of Arbitration ruled earlier this week that BlackBerry had failed to make certain payments to Nokia under a patent licence contract, BlackBerry said on Friday.

The ruling, in a previously undisclosed disagreement over a smartphone technology licensing deal signed in 2012, highlights the financial risks technology companies face from disputes over intellectual property, which are sometimes resolved through confidential arbitration processes unknown to investors.

BlackBerry won a $940 million payout from chipmaker Qualcomm Inc earlier this year in a similar case of disputed payments.

BlackBerry has previously said it is looking to generate more revenue from its portfolio of some 40,000 patents by licensing them to other technology companies, and in November said that U.S.-based Marconi Group would help it license out a broad range of its patents.

It is often difficult for investors to value a company’s patent portfolio given the opaque nature of licensing deals and disputes.

“Patent issues are going to come up from time to time and as one-offs,” said Todd Coupland, an analyst at CIBC World Markets. “Getting in front of them, unless there is some detail, is going to be tough.”

BlackBerry shares were down 1.9 percent in midday Toronto trading, Nokia closed 2 percent lower in Helsinki.

BlackBerry disclosed in February that it had filed separate patent infringement complaints against Nokia, alleging that several of the Finnish network equipment maker’s base stations and related software infringed on 11 of its patents.

Nokia, which sells these products to telecom operators, said in a statement on Friday that it believes those infringement claims “are without merit.”

BlackBerry said it would take a GAAP charge on its results, but did not say when the ruling would hit its financials.

Nokia said a significant portion of the amount awarded had already been recognised in its financials.

However, EU officials and diplomats cautioned on Sunday that it was still unclear that a deal would be struck with the British prime minister when she meets the EU executive.

Two hours before they sit down for lunch with May in Brussels, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will brief Guy Verhofstadt and his European Parliament Brexit team, an official said.

Verhofstadt and his colleagues wrote to the EU negotiators last week to sound an alarm at what they said were “stalled” talks on EU demands that the rights of EU citizens in Britain be guaranteed directly by the European Court of Justice after Britain leaves the European Union. They also voiced concern about Northern Ireland.

Parliament must ratify any treaty on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union before Brexit in March 2019 in order to create the smooth transition period May wants, and so it will be vital to both sides to keep the legislators on board.

Senior EU officials and diplomats said work was continuing on Sunday. One person close to the discussions said the situation was “delicate”. “It’s still quite fluid,” said a second person involved. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”

Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and strong critic of Brexit, declined to comment.

The German leader of the center-right group in the EU parliament warned that lawmakers were not yet satisfied.

“On Brexit negotiations, money is one of the problems, but it is not the biggest one,” Manfred Weber said in a statement. “We are much more concerned about the fact that so far negotiations are stalled on the protection of EU citizens’ rights after Brexit and on the Irish case,” he said.

The EU wants outline accords on three critical divorce terms before it will open negotiations on the transition and a future free trade pact that would follow. May’s lunch on Monday is a deadline for the EU to have her final offers before EU leaders consider whether to agree at a Dec. 15 summit to launch Phase 2.

Britain and the EU aim to sign a joint declaration setting out progress toward final deals which the Commission, as the EU executive, would say was “sufficient” for opening trade talks.

EU officials say terms have been agreed for a financial settlement long resisted by hardline supporters of Brexit. The Irish prime minister said on Saturday that would essentially cover all the 60 billion euros the EU had demanded.

On the second key issue of a deal to avoid a “hard border” on land between Britain and the EU across the island of Ireland, diplomats say the joint document will set out rules for reaching a border deal aimed at avoiding disruption to peace in the north but leaving open many of the details.

CITIZENS’ RIGHTS

The third issue, of citizens’ rights, has long seemed the least problematic, but the European Parliament’s concerns were a reminder of how far the insistence on the ECJ having the final say in whether London was respecting the withdrawal treaty conflicts with British demands to be free of EU courts.

It was not immediately clear what compromise, if any, has been found. EU governments had also been pressing London to give better terms to EU expatriates on bringing in future family members and on moving social welfare benefits across borders.

One suggestion in Brussels has been to limit clearly any ECJ involvement as a last resort and clearly only available to those EU citizens who choose to go on living in Britain before Brexit, not to any who arrive later. There are 3 million of them today.

Looking to show skeptical pro-Brexit allies that she has secured something in five months of negotiation that seem set to end with London broadly accepting the EU’s original terms, May has insisted that Brussels make a simultaneous and reciprocal commitment to transition and trade talks if she accepts a deal.

That seems set to be the case with the joint declaration.

“Everyone knows we have to honor politically what the Brits have accepted on money,” a senior EU diplomat said. “So on Monday they will sign this document.”

If all goes to the plan, 27 EU leaders would give the official green light on Dec. 15, a day after May has joined them for a routine summit on other EU business..

The deliberately vague concept of “sufficient progress” gives the political leaders the option to leave plenty of room for future negotiation. The key thing for many in Brussels is that it should mark the establishment of trust that both sides are willing to work for a separation that is not too disruptive.","As Brexit deal takes shape, Juncker to meet MEPs",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-juncker-parliament/as-brexit-deal-takes-shape-juncker-to-meet-meps-idUKKBN1DX0AK?il=0

Lo ha detto il presidente di Intesa Sanpaolo Gian Maria Gros-Pietro a margine di un convegno a Milano.

”L‘addendum affronta un tema importante e credo sia il momento giusto di affrontarlo e risolverlo, perché la massa di npl che ci sono in Europa e in particolare in Italia è un‘eredità della crisi. Ora che la ripresa è cominciata, è il momento buono per passare oltre questa eredità”, ha spiegato Gros-Pietro.

“Lo strumento che è stato presentato con l‘addendum, secondo la mia opinione, comporta qualche problema. Quello principale è che viene assegnato ai crediti non garantiti dopo due anni un valore nullo, che non è quello che risulta dalle nostre statistiche e dalla nostra gestione degli npl e per i garantiti dopo sette anni”, ha spiegato. “C‘è uno scollamento evidente con la realtà, perché il valore del credito garantito dipende dalla validità della garanzia e non dal passare del tempo”.

Secondo Gros-Pietro, ”che l‘addendum avesse bisogno di una riconsiderazione era evidente nel momento in cui la Bce lo ha presentato per la consultazione. Era già nelle intenzioni della Bce di poterlo riconsiderare e ora abbiamo la possibilità di farlo tenendo presente che ci sarà un contributo della Commissione”.

“Noi abbiamo una nostra idea su come va affrontato nei limiti del possibile: riportando in bonis il debitore. Noi ne abbiamo riportati in bonis 67 mila in quasi tre anni e solo nei casi gravi e incurabili abbiamo ceduto i crediti e lo abbiamo fatto al valore netto di libro, che vuol dire che sui crediti veramente cattivi avevamo fatto accantonamenti adeguati”, ha concluso.

Merck’s financial adviser JPMorgan has invited bids for the business, which is valued at about 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion), ahead of a Dec. 15 deadline, the sources said.

Nestle is widely seen as a natural buyer for the maker of Seven Seas vitamins and Bion nutritional supplements, after previous talks to set up a consumer joint venture with Merck fell through over the summer.

Bain and Cinven, who earlier this year took control of Germany’s Stada, are hoping to use the Merck unit as a buy-and-build platform for Stada, which makes generic drugs and consumer care products and had annual revenues of more than 2 billion euros in 2016, the sources said.

The private equity firms are making an opportunistic move on Merck consumer health as they want to have options to build on the business they have with Stada, one of the sources said.

Other buyout funds which do not have a presence in the consumer and healthcare industries and would not be able to use existing portfolio companies as an acquisition vehicle have been advised against entering the process, they said.

Merck, which declined to comment, has seen enough interest from industry buyers, they said, pointing to takeover appetite from emerging markets.

Nestle, Stada, Cinven and Bain all declined to comment.

Merck’s vitamins and nutritional supplements would fit Nestle’s ambition to expand in consumer healthcare, a fast-growing area CEO Mark Schneider has made a priority.

Nestle has also been offered the $20 billion consumer health business that U.S. drug giant Pfizer is selling, the sources said.

But Merck’s portfolio is smaller and less diversified than Pfizer’s and would keep Nestle closer to its core strength in packaged food, the sources said.

Nestle, which wants to become a “nutrition, health and wellness company,” promised shareholders in September that moving into consumer health would not be “a carte blanche for reckless diversification.”

Consumer health is a fragmented sector ranging from over-the-counter medicines and vitamins to sports nutrition products and condoms. It has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand.

Stada’s owners are also mulling bids for the generic drug business being sold by Sanofi, the sources said, and might favor this combination over Merck as generic drugs are typically valued at a cheaper multiple.

Merck said in September that it would consider selling the $1 billion-a-year consumer health unit to help fund more research into prescription drugs.

Customers swear by the practice of “blade wash eyes”, as it is known in Mandarin, saying they trust Xiong’s skill with the blade.

“No, it’s not dangerous,” said 68-year-old Zhang Tian. “My eyes feel refreshed after shaving and I feel comfortable.”

Xiong, 62, said he learned the technique in the 1980s and serves up to eight customers a week, charging 80 yuan ($12) per shave.

“It was difficult at the beginning, but it became a piece of cake afterwards,” he said.

The technique appears to unblock moisturizing sebaceous glands along the rim of the eyelid, said Qu Chao, an opthalmologist who works at a nearby hospital in Chengdu.

“Patients will feel their eyes are dry and uncomfortable when the glands are blocked,” she said. “When he is shaving, it is most likely that he is shaving the openings of these glands.”

The umbrella organization for the world’s central banks gave the warning as investors continue to bask in what it called the “light and warmth” of improving global growth, subdued inflation and soaring stock markets.

Record high debt levels, however, highlight vulnerabilities in the financial system and the scale of this year’s rally in asset prices seems to have increased caution at the Switzerland-based BIS.

“High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy (asset price) valuations,” the head of BIS’s monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said.

“The longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence.”

There was some surprise too that benchmark bond yields - which drive global borrowing costs - have stayed down even with the Federal Reserve now shrinking its balance sheet and the European Central Bank also about to heavily cut its stimulus.

The improving global growth outlook, Japan’s ongoing money printing and the message from both the Fed and ECB that they will tread carefully going forward was the likely explanation for still low yields, though they did raise a “deeper question”.

“Can a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions unambiguously ease? And, if the answer is no, what should central banks do?” Borio said.

The pace of tightening from the likes of the Fed is already expected to be the slowest on record.

One concern is that the continued low bond yields and low market volatility, particularly in the United States, are reminiscent of the bond market “conundrum” referred to by former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in 2005 before the financial crisis.

Yields remained low then too despite a run of U.S. rate hikes and only gained any traction later in the cycle.

“In an era in which gradualism and predictability are becoming the norm, these questions (about effective tightening) are likely to grow more pressing.”

It is especially the case with some stock market gauges now in “frothy” territory.

At recent levels in excess of 30, the U.S. stock market’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), for example, has exceeded its post-1982 average by almost 25 percent.

The dividend payout ratio of U.S. companies is also back at highs observed in the 1970s and so might not go much further. “High valuations: market complacency?” the BIS posed the question, though it said stocks did look much less frothy when measured against extremely low bonds yields.

“I am seeing signals, news that some businessmen are trying to move their assets abroad, and I call on firstly my cabinet from here to never allow this exit for any of them because these people are traitors,” Erdogan said.

Speaking to members of his ruling AK Party in the eastern province of Mus, Erdogan did not say to whom he was referring, nor did he single out a single business, person or country of destination.

His comments come after the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Friday that Turkish prosecutors were set to seize the assets of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in the trial of a Turkish bank executive charged with evading U.S. sanctions on Iran, and his acquaintances.

The trial has caused already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington to deteriorate further as Zarrab detailed in court a scheme to evade the U.S. sanctions, saying that Erdogan personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when prime minister.

Ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine Turkey and its economy, and has previously said it was a “clear plot” by the network of U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year’s coup attempt.

The outcome of months of haggling shows the UK has a lot less leverage than it pretends.

Settling the Brexit bill, as the Financial Times reports the UK is ready to do, should have been the easy part. Anything else would increase the chances that it will exit in 2019 without a transition period or trade deal. Lost tax revenue could amount to 75-150 billion pounds by 2030, according to Breakingviews estimates.

The final bill, after deducting what the EU will owe Britain, is likely to be much lower – around 50 billion euros, according to the Financial Times. Even the gross figure of 100 billion euros would be covered within five years by the 350 million pounds a week that Brexiteers, such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, promised would become available once Britain stops paying into the EU budget.

Yet Prime Minister Theresa May has taken eight months to bow to the inevitable. Pandering to the eurosceptic members of her Conservative party has wasted more than a quarter of the two years she has to negotiate an exit and has cost her goodwill. May has also shown EU negotiators that UK bravado – embodied by Johnson’s July remark that the bloc could “go whistle” for its money – can be easily ignored.

May’s hand may not get much better. Honouring its financial commitments could give the UK a brief transition period to plan its departure and sketch out a deal with its main trading partner. Yet the prospect of a “hard” Brexit will still loom if those talks founder. Negotiating a basic agreement for trade in goods, such as the EU’s recent pact with Canada, would be painful for the UK services sector, which makes up around four-fifths of the economy. A better deal would require Britain to abide by EU regulation and accept more immigration and budget payments – all red lines for May’s party. Having seen May fold once, EU negotiators will be quicker to call her bluff in the future.",Breakingviews - UK plays weak hand badly in Brexit poker,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-uk-plays-weak-hand-badly-in-brexit-poker-idUSKBN1DT1GU

Saleh bot einer sunnitischen Militärkoalition unter Führung Saudi-Arabiens am Wochenende an, eine “neue Seite” aufzuschlagen, falls diese die Angriffe auf Jemeniten einstelle. Zugleich appellierte Saleh an die Nachbarländer, die Belagerung aufzuheben, Flughäfen zu öffnen und Hilfslieferungen ins Land zu lassen. Die Militärallianz begrüßte das Gesprächsangebot. Salehs Einlenken könnte den Weg für ein Ende des seit fast drei Jahren andauernden Bürgerkriegs ebnen. Die vom Iran unterstützten Huthi-Rebellen warfen dagegen Saleh Verrat vor und kündigten weitere Angriffe auf das Bündnis an.

Damit wird die Kluft zwischen Saleh und den einst mit ihm verbündeten Huthi-Rebellen größer. Seit Tagen kämpfen die Rebllen in der Hauptstadt Sanaa gegen Anhänger des langjährigen Staatschefs. Bei den Kämpfen sind nach Angaben von Helfern Dutzende Menschen getötet und Hunderte verletzt worden. In der Nacht auf Sonntag bombardierte die von Saudi-Arabien geführte Koalition Huthi-Stellungen in Sanaa aus der Luft, wie Anwohner und Medien berichteten.

However, EU officials and diplomats cautioned on Sunday that it was still unclear that a deal would be struck with the British prime minister when she meets the EU executive.

Two hours before they sit down for lunch with May in Brussels, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will brief Guy Verhofstadt and his European Parliament Brexit team, an official said.

Verhofstadt and his colleagues wrote to the EU negotiators last week to sound an alarm at what they said were “stalled” talks on EU demands that the rights of EU citizens in Britain be guaranteed directly by the European Court of Justice after Britain leaves the European Union. They also voiced concern about Northern Ireland.

Parliament must ratify any treaty on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union before Brexit in March 2019 in order to create the smooth transition period May wants, and so it will be vital to both sides to keep the legislators on board.

Senior EU officials and diplomats said work was continuing on Sunday. One person close to the discussions said the situation was “delicate”. “It’s still quite fluid,” said a second person involved. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”

Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and strong critic of Brexit, declined to comment.

The German leader of the center-right group in the EU parliament warned that lawmakers were not yet satisfied.

“On Brexit negotiations, money is one of the problems, but it is not the biggest one,” Manfred Weber said in a statement. “We are much more concerned about the fact that so far negotiations are stalled on the protection of EU citizens’ rights after Brexit and on the Irish case,” he said.

The EU wants outline accords on three critical divorce terms before it will open negotiations on the transition and a future free trade pact that would follow. May’s lunch on Monday is a deadline for the EU to have her final offers before EU leaders consider whether to agree at a Dec. 15 summit to launch Phase 2.

Britain and the EU aim to sign a joint declaration setting out progress toward final deals which the Commission, as the EU executive, would say was “sufficient” for opening trade talks.

EU officials say terms have been agreed for a financial settlement long resisted by hardline supporters of Brexit. The Irish prime minister said on Saturday that would essentially cover all the 60 billion euros the EU had demanded.

On the second key issue of a deal to avoid a “hard border” on land between Britain and the EU across the island of Ireland, diplomats say the joint document will set out rules for reaching a border deal aimed at avoiding disruption to peace in the north but leaving open many of the details.

CITIZENS’ RIGHTS

The third issue, of citizens’ rights, has long seemed the least problematic, but the European Parliament’s concerns were a reminder of how far the insistence on the ECJ having the final say in whether London was respecting the withdrawal treaty conflicts with British demands to be free of EU courts.

It was not immediately clear what compromise, if any, has been found. EU governments had also been pressing London to give better terms to EU expatriates on bringing in future family members and on moving social welfare benefits across borders.

One suggestion in Brussels has been to limit clearly any ECJ involvement as a last resort and clearly only available to those EU citizens who choose to go on living in Britain before Brexit, not to any who arrive later. There are 3 million of them today.

Looking to show skeptical pro-Brexit allies that she has secured something in five months of negotiation that seem set to end with London broadly accepting the EU’s original terms, May has insisted that Brussels make a simultaneous and reciprocal commitment to transition and trade talks if she accepts a deal.

That seems set to be the case with the joint declaration.

“Everyone knows we have to honor politically what the Brits have accepted on money,” a senior EU diplomat said. “So on Monday they will sign this document.”

If all goes to the plan, 27 EU leaders would give the official green light on Dec. 15, a day after May has joined them for a routine summit on other EU business..

The deliberately vague concept of “sufficient progress” gives the political leaders the option to leave plenty of room for future negotiation. The key thing for many in Brussels is that it should mark the establishment of trust that both sides are willing to work for a separation that is not too disruptive.","As Brexit deal takes shape, Juncker to meet MEPs",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DX0AK

On the last day of his three-day visit to Bangladesh, which came after meetings in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, the pope went to a home in Dhaka founded by Mother Teresa for orphans, unwed mothers and destitute elderly.

Later in a speech to an audience of around 7,000 young Catholics, Muslims and followers of other religions, the pope spoke about welcoming and accepting those who “act and think differently than ourselves”.

“When a people, a religion or a society turns into a ‘little world’, they lose the best that they have and plunge into a self-righteous mentality of ‘I am good and you are bad’,” Francis said at the Notre Dame College, founded by Catholic priests.

He also asked his young listeners to “not spend the whole day playing with your phone and ignoring the world around you!”

Francis said he was very pleased by an inter-religious meeting on Friday night, where he had an emotional meeting with refugees from Myanmar and then used the word Rohingya for the first time on his current trip, saying they had God within them and should be respected. He also sought their forgiveness in the name of all who persecuted them.

Previously, in Myanmar, he followed the advice of Myanmar Church officials who said his use of the word could prompt a backlash against Christians and hurt that country’s fragile path to democracy.

That had disappointed rights groups such as Amnesty International, which has said Myanmar’s “security forces were carrying out a systematic, organized and ruthless campaign of violence against the Rohingya population.”

Myanmar’s military has denied the allegations.

The country does not recognize the stateless Rohingya as an ethnic group with its own identity and considers them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

PRAISE FOR BANGLADESH

Mother Teresa, who started the Missionaries of Charity to serve “the poorest of the poor,” opened the Dhaka home in the early 1970s to look after Bengali women who became pregnant as a result of rape by Pakistani soldiers during the war of independence.

The pope made an impromptu address to nuns and priests at the home during which he praised Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country where Catholics make up less than one percent of its around 169 million people, for having what he called some of the best inter-religious relations in the world.

His words of appreciation have been welcomed by Bangladesh, which was already home to around 400,000 Rohingya Muslims before nearly 625,000 more came since August after the Myanmar army launched an offensive in response to attacks on security posts by Rohingya militants.

Bangladesh last week signed an agreement to return the refugees over time, “while at the same time expanding refugee camps and constructing tens of thousands of shelters for them in Bangladesh until they are able to return”, a statement issued on behalf of the government said.

“Dear friends in Myanmar and Bangladesh, thank you for your welcome!” Francis said on Twitter as his flight took off. “Upon you I invoke divine blessings of harmony and peace.”",Pope ends sensitive trip to Asia after seeking Rohingya forgiveness,https://www.reuters.com/article/pope-asia-bangladesh/pope-ends-sensitive-trip-to-asia-after-seeking-rohingya-forgiveness-idINKBN1DW05W

Malian and French officials have given contradicting accounts of the Oct. 23 strike on a camp of the Ansar Dine militant group, which the French army said took 15 Islamists “out of action”.

France’s defense minister has said her services had “factual information” showing the fighters were all jihadists, including ex-Malian soldiers enrolled by Islamists, contradicting comments from the Malian defense ministry.

But in a interview with Jeune Afrique magazine, Malian President Ibrahim Boubakar Keita insisted that was not the case:

“They were the terrorists’ hostages and there should be no ambiguity about that between our French friends and us,” he said.

“It’s regrettable, it can unfortunately happen in this type of operations. We should admit it and not look for reasons that don’t exist.”

The Malian government is struggling to contain Tuareg and Islamist violence in northern Mali, some of which is spreading south. Attempts to place officials in northern towns have sometimes failed, raising questions about the government’s ability to maintain stability ahead of elections.

Islamist militants seized northern Mali in 2012 and French forces intervened a year later.

The International Court of Arbitration ruled earlier this week that BlackBerry had failed to make certain payments to Nokia under a patent licence contract, BlackBerry said on Friday.

The ruling, in a previously undisclosed disagreement over a smartphone technology licensing deal signed in 2012, highlights the financial risks technology companies face from disputes over intellectual property, which are sometimes resolved through confidential arbitration processes unknown to investors.

BlackBerry won a $940 million payout from chipmaker Qualcomm Inc earlier this year in a similar case of disputed payments.

BlackBerry has previously said it is looking to generate more revenue from its portfolio of some 40,000 patents by licensing them to other technology companies, and in November said that U.S.-based Marconi Group would help it license out a broad range of its patents.

It is often difficult for investors to value a company’s patent portfolio given the opaque nature of licensing deals and disputes.

“Patent issues are going to come up from time to time and as one-offs,” said Todd Coupland, an analyst at CIBC World Markets. “Getting in front of them, unless there is some detail, is going to be tough.”

BlackBerry shares were down 1.9 percent in midday Toronto trading, Nokia closed 2 percent lower in Helsinki.

BlackBerry disclosed in February that it had filed separate patent infringement complaints against Nokia, alleging that several of the Finnish network equipment maker’s base stations and related software infringed on 11 of its patents.

Nokia, which sells these products to telecom operators, said in a statement on Friday that it believes those infringement claims “are without merit.”

BlackBerry said it would take a GAAP charge on its results, but did not say when the ruling would hit its financials.

Nokia said a significant portion of the amount awarded had already been recognised in its financials.

Nokia sold its once-dominant phone business in 2014, sticking to its network equipment business and broad patent portfolio. It has licensed technology to smartphone makers Samsung Electronics, Apple, Xiaomi Technology and LG Electronics.","BlackBerry loses payment dispute with Nokia, to pay $137 million",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-nokia-patents/blackberry-loses-payment-dispute-with-nokia-to-pay-137-million-idUSKBN1DV517

The Arab League meeting capped a month in which the Middle East suddenly seemed to plunge toward a wider regional conflict. Saudi Arabia charged that a missile fired at its capital from Yemen on Nov. 4 was provided to Yemeni rebels by Iran and constituted “an act of war.” Saudi leaders then pushed Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri into a surprise resignation during a trip to Saudi Arabia as a way of exerting pressure on Iran and Hezbollah. “Wherever Iran is involved, there is nothing but devastation and chaos,” Hariri said in his resignation speech on Nov. 4, which was broadcast from the Saudi capital, Riyadh. He added, “Iran’s hands in the region will be cut off.”

These actions underscore a newly aggressive Saudi foreign policy, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is eager to challenge Iran more directly and has amassed tremendous power under the rule of his father, King Salman.

But forcing Hariri to resign and ratcheting up tensions with Iran over Yemen has backfired on the prince and his advisers. The lack of support from fellow Arab leaders for tougher action against Iran and Hezbollah shows that few Saudi allies are willing to confront Iran directly.

Saudi Arabia had invested years of political effort and tens of millions of dollars to support Hariri and his political movement in Lebanon, especially after the assassination of Hariri’s father, Rafik, in February 2005. The elder Hariri had served as Lebanon’s prime minister for more than a decade, and he became the country’s most prominent Sunni leader and Saudi Arabia’s most important Lebanese ally.

Saad Hariri took office in late 2016, forming a national unity government that included Hezbollah. The power-sharing agreement was approved by Iran and Saudi Arabia. But in recent months, Saudi leaders grew worried that Hariri, who has strong ties to Western and Sunni Arab leaders, was becoming a fig leaf for a government dominated by Hezbollah and its supporters, including Lebanese President Michel Aoun.

Saudi leaders thought that they would be able to push Hariri aside, withdraw political cover from Hezbollah, and make it easier for Sunni Arab states — along with the United States and Israel — to target the group. (After an earlier round of sanctions, the U.S. Congress is considering a new sanctions bill targeting Hezbollah and its funders.)

But after Hariri’s sudden departure, Lebanese from all political factions rallied around him and insisted that his resignation was invalid because Saudi leaders coerced him. As international concern grew that Hariri was being held captive by his Saudi patrons, French President Emmanuel Macron invited him to Paris. Hariri met with Macron on Nov. 18 and returned to Lebanon for the country's Nov. 22 Independence Day celebrations.

Tensions have eased over the past week, and it’s unlikely that the latest crisis will escalate into a military confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But while the prospect of direct clashes between the two regional rivals has eased, their ongoing proxy war is destabilizing the Middle East.

The two powers have backed competing factions in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. While the conflict is partly rooted in the historical Sunni-Shi’ite split within Islam, it’s mainly a struggle for regional political dominance between Shi’ite-led Iran and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia.

Their proxy battles, which now also involve other powers like Russia and the United States, are at the root of much of the death and destruction in the Middle East in recent years. They have cost hundreds of thousands of lives, especially in Syria, where more than 400,000 have been killed since the March 2011 uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which is supported by Iran and Hezbollah. The Syrian war has also produced more than 5 million refugees whose search for sanctuary has triggered political crises in neighboring countries as well as Europe.

In January 2015, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah died after 20 years in power. He was succeeded by his brother Salman, who quickly pursued a more aggressive foreign policy. Instead of relying on U.S. military intervention and battling Iran through surrogates and checkbook diplomacy, as his predecessor had done, the new king and his advisers launched a war against Houthi, mostly Shi’ite, rebels in Yemen in March 2015. As the war has dragged on, air strikes by Saudi Arabia and its allies caused most of the estimated 10,000 civilian deaths.

Saudi Arabia is now bogged down in the Yemen conflict. Despite intensive air strikes and a blockade, Riyadh and its allies still have not been able to dislodge the Houthis from Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.

Yemen has become a central arena of the proxy battle, especially after Saudi Arabia’s “act of war” accusation against Iran. The kingdom claimed that the ballistic missile it shot down on Nov. 4 en route to the Saudi capital had been smuggled into Yemen in parts. Saudi officials say members of Hezbollah and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps assembled the missile, and then helped Houthi rebels fire it from Yemeni territory. (Iran and Hezbollah denied involvement in the missile launch.)

Saudi leaders have since scaled back their efforts to declare Lebanon a hostile state.

At the same time, however, it’s also a sign of how stretched those forces have become.

Getting three carriers to the Pacific has been an intrinsic part of Washington’s strategy to intimidate North Korea. But to do so required pulling forces from a host of other potential conflict areas, including the Gulf.

The ever-increasing demand for military resources in a growing number of places is causing increased concern in the U.S. military. In June, a report by the U.S. Army War College described America’s military clout as “fraying” and bluntly concluded that the era of U.S. global military primacy that followed the fall of the Berlin wall was over. America’s armed forces have a variety of strategies to tackle that decline but the truth is that coming wars will look very different from the sort of military deployments taken for granted in the recent past.

The change from a decade or so ago could scarcely be starker. In the aftermath of 9/11, America’s conventional military capability was narrowly focused on a handful of locations, primarily Iraq and Afghanistan. The resources plowed into them were stupendous – $5.6 trillion so far, academics at Brown University estimated this month. That would imply a cost per individual U.S. taxpayer of more than $23,000, including future care for veterans.

At their height, those wars dominated U.S. military thinking, planning and workload in a way that is hard to overstate. Working from Pentagon figures, the Brown researchers estimate that some 2.7 million American service personnel passed through those two countries in that time, more than half of them deploying more than once. Officially, however, these conflicts were never seen as endless wars – the hope was always that one last surge of troops would win the day and allow a larger withdrawal.

That didn’t happen, and U.S. military planners now assume there will be a substantial presence in Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries for years, if not decades, to come. Since the middle of the Obama administration, however, the Pentagon has quietly and comprehensively changed its approach to those wars, aiming for a much more sustainable “advise and assist” model working through local forces.

Speaking at the Association of the U.S. Army meeting in Washington in October, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley made it clear he expected such missions to grow substantially in the years to come. The success of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria demonstrates such tactics can work. But there have also been substantial failures and wastage, not least in Afghanistan where local security forces continue to struggle despite absorbing $70 billion of U.S. funding since 2001.

Much of the burden of U.S. operations in the last 15 years has fallen on a handful of special operations units, whose budgets, personnel numbers and deployments have all risen dramatically. They are now dangerously overstretched, and the U.S. Army is now looking to create more mainstream units to take on unconventional deployments.

With much of the fighting left to local forces, U.S. casualties are substantially lower. But as the death of four U.S. Green Berets in Niger last month demonstrated, putting troops far forward with less backup than they could call on in Iraq and Afghanistan means that when things go wrong, they go bad fast.

The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt leaves San Diego, California,October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Another awkward truth: In the last year U.S. personnel have been more likely to die in accidents than action, the result of a series of incidents including the high profile collisions of destroyers USS Fitzgerald and McCain. That toll suggests that even the parts of the U.S. military that have not been fighting wars are perhaps dangerously overstretched.

That’s been particularly true in Asia, where both the Fitzgerald and McCain were based. Tensions with China and North Korea have kept those units on high alert. In Europe too, heightened tensions with Russia have resulted in a scale of U.S. military activity unseen since the Cold War. U.S. troops, planes, ships and submarines are now on almost continuous exercises to reassure allies and track Russia’s increasingly active forces as Moscow probes NATO air and sea borders.

The Pentagon budget – $825 billion this fiscal year – is rising, and continues to dwarf that of any other nation. But it is also spread much more widely. China and Russia – spending $146 billion and 70 billion respectively – lack America’s global reach, but are more aggressively focused on their own immediate neighborhoods. Both have aggressively plowed resources into techniques and tactics such as cyber warfare and missiles that U.S. tacticians worry might give them the edge in any local war.

Some of that was expected – the Obama administration began its “pivot” to Asia in 2012 because of the perceived growing China threat. Much, however, was not – not least the speed with which North Korea has raced towards being able to strike the U.S. with nuclear-tipped missiles.

Washington’s military capabilities still dwarf anyone else’s. But it now faces a very real danger that its foes may be able to bleed it to death without ever confronting it in battle.",Commentary: The truth behind the U.S. show of force in Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-military-commentary/commentary-the-truth-behind-the-u-s-show-of-force-in-asia-idUSKBN1DD20A

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added.

The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N).

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

“(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.",Aetna's board set to approve $68 billion sale to CVS Health: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/aetnas-board-set-to-approve-68-billion-sale-to-cvs-health-sources-idUSKBN1DX0NC?il=0

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

With billion of dollars in sales at stake, patent holders such as world No. 1 smartphone chip maker Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia and users such as Apple, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler have lobbied the European Union executive in the past year to put forward their views.

The Commission’s guidelines initially favored patent owners but were then modified to add in elements to support users. The final draft was watered down after regulators decided not to take sides following intense last-minute lobbying, people familiar with the matter said.

“Some people have asked us to take sides. We believe stakeholders should solve the issue themselves. Patent wars do not help anybody,” Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen told a news conference on Wednesday.

The technology industry depends on thousands of patents that companies frequently cross license to rivals, while reserving their most strategic intellectual property to create proprietary products.

But intense competition sometimes spills over into costly legal battles as seen in a string of patent wars among smartphone makers in recent years.

The guidelines no longer require patent owners to provide licenses to all, the people said - a victory for patent holders such as Qualcomm. However, the guidelines do not specifically back the system under which users pay different rates to use patents, as the patent holders had wanted.

However, Qualcomm’s royalty approach, known as use-based or value-based, predominates in the tech industry with royalties based on how much value a technology adds to a product. It is an important source of profits for the company and others which have adopted it.

“The whole debate is still open. On balance, it is a win for Qualcomm and other patent owners,” one expert in patents said.

The guidelines are part of a broader drive by the Commission to set new rules for internet-connected devices for cars, home automation and energy devices beyond computers and smartphones.

The EU’s planned measures include setting up an expert group to look into licensing practices, intellectual property valuation and how to determine fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory royalties, and a project to evaluate which patents are essential to ensure that different devices can work together.",EU regulator spells out license guidelines to prevent patent wars,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-patents/eu-regulator-spells-out-license-guidelines-to-prevent-patent-wars-idUSKBN1DT1K0

The ticking clock on the Republican Party’s efforts to cut corporate taxes, alongside the risk that the U.S. government may shut down if a budget deal isn’t reached by December 8, is increasing the levels of political risk for investors - but they have yet to really react.

“Right now the market is assuming that everything will work out, but you’ve got a tremendous number of moving parts,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors (FII.N) in New York.

Alongside the back-and-forth on taxes, Wall Street will be watching a Dec. 8 expiration date for funding needed to keep the U.S. government open alongside the deadline when the U.S. Treasury hits its limit on borrowing; as well as a Dec. 12 Special U.S. Senate election in Alabama.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned on Twitter that “I don’t see a deal” to keep the government open and work past Dec. 8, although the White House said Wednesday it did not see such an eventuality.

Typically, the threat of a government shutdown alone would prompt fund managers to move more of their assets into cash. The benchmark S&P 500 lost 2.6 percent in the eight trading days before the last government shutdown in 2013, and has declined an average of 0.6 percent during government shutdowns overall, according to LPL Financial. Debt limit concerns are likely to be put off until 2018 as the U.S. Treasury is expected to take steps to postpone any need for action by Congress.

Yet with the benchmark S&P 500 up nearly 18 percent for the year to date, some portfolio managers see a greater risk in stepping to the sidelines. Throughout the year, the stock market has rallied in the face of standoffs ranging from increasing tensions in North Korea to former FBI director’s James Comey’s testimony to Congress that President Trump fired him to undermine the agency’s Russia investigation.

On Friday, stocks sold off on a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to tell investigators that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. However, shares quickly pared those losses.

Despite his skepticism, Orlando has yet to move more of his assets to cash, in large part because corporate earnings keep rising and should continue to do so even if a tax package is not signed, he said.

If the tax bill fails, Orlando said he expected the S&P 500 to fall by as much as 10 percent. He would be a buyer in that case, he said, because he expected the S&P 500 to reach 3000 within the next 18 months.

CROWDED CALENDAR

Brian Peery, a portfolio manager at Novato, California-based Hennessy Funds (HNNA.O), said a government shutdown or the tax bill failing would prompt a swift sell-off, but that rising consumer confidence would ultimately continue to push the market higher over the next year.

“If I‘m looking at a 10 percent correction, I‘m a buyer,” he said.

The inaction is not limited to the stock market.

Christopher Ryon, a municipal bond fund manager at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, said that the Republican tax bill could reduce the size of the municipal bond market by 25 to 30 percent by limiting the ability of stadiums, airports and privately-financed toll roads to qualify for tax-exempt status.

At the same time, there could be an increased demand for municipal bonds if residents of high-tax states are no longer able to deduct their full state and local property taxes, leaving tax-free municipal bonds as one of the few ways wealthy investors can reduce their taxable incomes.

As a result, Ryon is largely sitting on his hands, ignoring both lower-rated bonds that have rallied as investors have reached for yield and triple A rated bonds that look “on the rich side,” he said.

“There are a whole lot of unintended consequences attached to this [tax] legislation,” Ryon said. “This is going to be an interesting couple of weeks where we will really see how the sausage gets made.”",Fear of missing out keeps investors in stocks despite risks,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/fear-of-missing-out-keeps-investors-in-stocks-despite-risks-idUSKBN1DV5ZH?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The president’s comment suggested he may have known Flynn lied to the FBI before he urged the FBI director not to investigate his former adviser, legal experts said. But they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when.

Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump aides.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump said on Twitter while he was in New York for a fundraising trip. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Flynn, who on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who was Trump’s national security adviser only for 24 days. He was forced to resign after he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak.

“What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for the New York trip. “There’s been absolutely no collusion, so we’re very happy.”

Establishing when Trump was told Flynn lied to the FBI agents could be key to determining if the president acted improperly.

According to a person familiar with the matter, during a conversation between White House counsel Don McGahn and then-acting attorney general Sally Yates in January, Yates told McGahn that Flynn had told FBI agents the same thing he had told Pence.

This was the same conversation reported earlier this year in which Yates told McGahn that Flynn had misled the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and that he might be compromised, the person said.

However, Yates did not give McGahn the impression that the FBI was actively pursuing Flynn for lying, the source said. McGahn did not believe the FBI was investigating Flynn for lying because the bureau had not revoked his security clearance, the person said.

McGahn shared the information from Yates with the president, the person said.

A lawyer for McGahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yates did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Legal experts said if Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI and then pressured then-FBI director James Comey not to investigate him, that would be problematic.

If that were the case Trump’s tweet “absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge,” said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Notre Dame University. “It is evidence of the crucial question of whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent.”

In May, the president fired Comey, who later accused Trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the Russia allegations. Comey also said he believed Trump had asked him to drop the FBI’s probe into Flynn.

Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, said the tweet is open to interpretation and that Trump’s lawyer would downplay its significance.

White House attorney Ty Cobb referred questions about the president’s tweet to Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd, who described it as a “paraphrase” of a statement Cobb had made on Friday reacting to Flynn’s guilty plea.

Slideshow (8 Images)

According to a person familiar with the matter, Dowd composed the tweet.

The tweet is “bizarre and helpful to Mueller and hurtful to the president,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago now at the law firm Thompson Coburn. “It’s one more piece of evidence that helps show the president’s intent when he fired Comey.”

As part of his plea on Friday, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The retired U.S. Army lieutenant general admitted in a Washington court that he lied to FBI investigators about his discussions last December with Kislyak.

In what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, the pair discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia, and Flynn asked Kislyak to help delay a United Nations vote seen as damaging to Israel, according to prosecutors.

Flynn was also told by a “very senior member” of Trump’s transition team to contact Russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the U.N. vote, the prosecutors said.

Sources told Reuters the “very senior” transition official was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Separately, speaking at a defense conference in California on Saturday, Trump’s current national security advisor H.R. McMaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of Flynn, his immediate predecessor, was hurting U.S. national security.

“There’s tremendous confidence, I think there’s more confidence in the United States frankly. I think there’s a sense that we’re re-engaging in areas where we had largely disengaged,” he said.","Trump notes Flynn lied to FBI, says his actions during transition were lawful",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-flynn/trump-notes-flynn-lied-to-fbi-says-his-actions-during-transition-were-lawful-idUSKBN1DW0HK

Questa l‘opinione prevalente raccolta da Reuters fra i gestori attivi in Italia e in Europa.

“Le elezioni italiane potrebbero portare volatilità nel breve e un temporaneo allargamento dello spread”, dice Matteo Germano, Head of Multi Asset di Amundi. “Ma i recenti upgrade dei rating (Italia e Portogallo da parte di S&P e l‘Irlanda da parte di Moody‘s) sono notizie positive per gli asset europei”.

Lo spread Btp/Bund a 10 anni è attualmente in area 140 punti base, vicino ai minimi 2017, dopo essere salito ad aprile sino a 210 punti proprio per effetto di timori politici (la possibile vittoria di forze populiste alle elezioni di Francia e Olanda).

Anche per M&G Investments le elezioni italiane “potrebbero incrementare la volatilità ma non il rischio intrinseco”, dice il direttore investimenti Manuel Pozzi.

Al momento il mercato “non sembra prezzare un esito particolare delle elezioni, bensì riflette il miglioramento congiunturale in atto”, secondo Pozzi. Considerando che l‘azionario italiano parte da utili e valutazioni depresse e i Btp pagano ancora un buon premio per il rischio sulle scadenze più lunghe, “sembra difficile che le elezioni possano portare a un peggioramento materiale dei fondamentali”, dice.

Il rendimento del Btp decennale nel corso del 2017 si è mosso tra l‘area 1,75% delle ultime settimane e il 2,50% visto in primavera.

C‘è poi chi, fra i gestori, vede all‘orizzonte un governo di coalizione che potrebbe riuscire a guadagnare il tempo necessario per implementare le riforme strutturali e chi constata che i mercati assegnano un peso sempre meno rilevante alle questioni politiche.

“E’ probabile che una discreta accelerazione macro-economica, la migliorata patrimonializzazione delle banche e l‘impegno della Bce limitino le possibili conseguenze negative se gli eventi politici in Italia dovessero prendere una piega più euroscettica”, osserva Peter van der Welle, strategist di Robeco.

Più controverso se l‘obbligazionario italiano incorpori già o meno un “premio” per l‘incertezza legata alle elezioni.

Secondo Vincent Chaigneau, responsabile della ricerca di Generali Investments, il rischio politico in Italia ad oggi è decisamente sottostimato dal mercato.

“I corporate high yield europei sono particolarmente esposti a questo rischio, perchè i nomi italiani rappresentano quasi il 20% dell‘intero indice”, dice.

Anche l‘indice delle blue chip FTSE Mib è potenzialmente a rischio, secondo Chaigneau, perchè ha raggiunto un premio di quasi il 25% rispetto alle valutazioni storiche; altri indici più ampi, come il MSCI Italy, sono viceversa più a sconto e potrebbero soffrire meno in caso di impasse politica.

Investors are looking for tax cuts to help sustain the rally in U.S. stocks. The separate bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

Goldman Sachs strategists in a Nov. 21 note said the likelihood of a U.S. tax overhaul was the biggest contributor to its raised forecasts, noting that tax cuts should boost 2018 S&P 500 earnings per share by 5 percent.

It raised its 2018 earnings per share forecast for S&P 500 companies to $150 from $139, and said that without a tax overhaul, the estimate would be $143.

Ed Hyman, founder and chairman of investment firm Evercore ISI wrote in a Nov. 19 note to clients that “assuming a 20 percent corporate tax rate,” it is forecasting S&P 500 EPS of $150 for next year.

UBS strategists this week estimated that the S&P 500 could see an earnings boost of 6.5 percent if the corporate tax rate falls to 25 percent. It projects a 9.5 percent gain if the rate goes to 20 percent.

“The buy side has largely factored this in,” said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities, which does not put out its own S&P 500 earnings forecast.

“The reality is people don’t really know what this will be at the end of the day, but clearly people think this is a positive that is going to be good for stocks.”

The S&P 500 .SPX is up about 18 percent so far in 2017.

Other firms have yet to factor tax changes into their 2018 profit forecasts, among them Credit Suisse. Wall Street equities analysts, which base their forecasts on guidance from the individual S&P 500 companies, have yet to include the lower tax rate in their estimates.

But market watchers say firms providing their own estimates are making adjustments now and others are likely to follow.

“Analysts on the Street, they’ve been prudent by not providing the benefits to earnings from tax cuts for 2018. Now you’ll see earnings estimates rising,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

The latest forecast for S&P 500 EPS, based on aggregated company estimates for 2018, is $146.19, compared with an estimate of $146.01 from Sept. 1, according to Thomson Reuters’ data.

Fisher had filmed all of her scenes for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the eighth installment of the blockbuster space saga, before she died of a heart attack in December 2016.

“She’s irreplaceable,” Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, told Reuters. “‘Star Wars’ is about great triumphs and great tragedies, and I can’t think of a bigger tragedy than missing our Leia,” Hamill told Reuters.

Writer and director Rian Johnson said he did not change Leia’s story in “Last Jedi” after her death. The film debuts in theaters December 14.

In “The Last Jedi,” “we didn’t tailor it to be a farewell to her,” Johnson said. “But, that having been said, I think there’s some moments that I think will really mean a lot to fans. You will see more from Leia that you haven’t seen before.”

Fisher’s final film appearance is expected to boost already feverish interest in the franchise, now owned by Walt Disney Co. Boxoffice.com projects “Last Jedi” will haul in $185 million to $215 million at U.S. and Canadian ticket windows its first weekend, which would rank as one of the biggest film debuts in history.

The cast and director provided few details about the film’s plot. John Boyega, who portrays former Stormtrooper Finn, said the movie finds Leia, now a general, leading the Resistance against the evil First Order during a tense time in the raging battle to protect the galaxy far, far away.

“There is a lot of pressure on the Resistance, and General Leia is on the front lines having to make big decisions,” Boyega said. “It’s a performance that requires a heartfelt approach, and she definitely had that.”

Oscar Isaac, who plays Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, said the time in Leia’s life mirrored Fisher’s in some ways.

Leia understands “she’s not going to be around forever, and there is a passing of the torch that needs to happen,” Isaac said. “She wants to give over as much of her wisdom as she can before this moment happens.”

Fisher, however, would not want fans to get too sentimental, Hamill said.

“I do know her well enough to say that she would want us to be laughing and even mocking her,” Hamill said.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Audi Sport said they intended to appeal, with the matter set to go before the governing FIA’s international tribunal.

The Audi driver had taken the chequered flag on his 25th birthday after long-time leader Edoardo Mortara spun late in the second race of the season.

But an inspection of his car revealed that the FIA security stickers on the inverters and motors did not correspond with those declared on the car’s technical passport.

The breach of technical and sporting regulations meant Abt lost his first victory and the overall lead in the all-electric series.

Saturday’s race winner Sam Bird now heads the drivers’ standings for DS Virgin Racing, with 35 points, two clear of French racer Jean-Eric Vergne.

Audi said the issue was apparently an administrative mistake that gave them no advantage on the racetrack.

“Daniel drove fantastically on both days and absolutely deserves this victory,” said Allan McNish, principal of Team Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler.

“We want the opportunity to be able to clarify all details, that’s why we’ve announced the intent to appeal.”

Former F1 driver and Le Mans 24 Hours winner McNish was in his first weekend as a Team Principal, heading up Audi’s Formula E involvement as a full works team.

“That we had a strong race performance on both days is a positive,” said Head of Audi Motorsport Dieter Gass. “But it goes without saying that we had a somewhat different idea of Sunday night.”

Rosenqvist’s victory was the second of his Formula E career.

The Mahindra driver had spun out of the lead from pole at the first corner but recovered to second place after Mortara then spun his Venturi car with less than three laps left.

New Zealand’s Mitch Evans was promoted to third to give Jaguar their first podium finish in the all-electric series they joined last year.

Audi, in their first weekend as a full works entry, were also fined 5,000 euros ($5,944) for a separate infringement.

FILE PHOTO: Chevrolet Cruze chassis move along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Doch die Partei zeigte sich auf ihrem Parteitag am Wochenende in Hannover tief gespalten.

Meuthen und Gauland stehen für eine eher nationalkonservative Ausrichtung. Beide wollen die Strömungen der Partei integrieren - auch den rechten Rand um den Thüringer Landeschef Björn Höcke. Scharfe Debatten werden im Vorstand aber wohl nicht ausbleiben. Denn dort ist der als gemäßigt geltende Berliner Landeschef Georg Pazderski zumindest ein Stück aufgerückt. Mit seiner Bewerbung als Co-Vorsitzender scheiterte er zwar in einer teils chaotischen Abstimmung, und Gauland sah sich gezwungen, mit seiner Kandidatur den Knoten zu lösen. Pazderski sagte aber, nun sei er Vizechef und wolle an seiner Linie festhalten. “Für mich ist das ein Erfolg.”

Pazderski will die AfD bürgerlicher aufstellen, um sie in absehbarer Zeit reif für eine Regierungsverantwortung machen. “Wir müssen schauen, wo das Potenzial der Wähler ist”, sagte er. “Und das Potenzial ist nicht rechts. Das ist in der bürgerlichen Mitte.” Er denke zum Beispiel an FDP-Wähler, die sich bisher nicht getraut hätten, die AfD zu wählen. Die AfD müsse irgendwann Verantwortung übernehmen, wenn sie etwas verändern wolle. Mit einer Ausrichtung, nicht Teil der Gesellschaft sein zu wollen und Fundamentalopposition zu betreiben, werde man das nicht erreichen.

GAULAND: “KEINE WURZELN ABSCHNEIDEN”

Auch Meuthen bekräftigte den Anspruch der AfD, eine Volkspartei zu sein. Doch er und Gauland bremsen: Die AfD sei noch nicht so weit, Regierungsverantwortung anzupeilen. Sie wollen zudem alle Strömungen in der Partei halten. Auf der einen Seite stehe die AfD klar bei den Bürgerbewegungen und auf der anderen Seite sei sie eine liberal-konservative Reformpartei, sagte Gauland. “Es hat keinen Zweck, irgendeine Wurzel abzuschneiden.”

Auch Meuthen will alle Strömungen integrieren. “Ich werde wahrgenommen als Exponent des Flügels”, sagte er mit Blick auf die rechte Gruppierung um Höcke und Sachsen-Anhalts AfD-Chef Andre Poggenburg. “Ich stehe zum Flügel. Das ist für mich ein - ich betone - ein Bestandteil unserer Partei.” Er werde auch weiter Einladungen von Gruppierungen der AfD wahrnehmen, verteidigte er sich gegen Kritik an einem Besuch eines Treffens des “Flügels”. “Aber deswegen bin ich doch kein Flügler.”

Diese Rolle übernimmt im Vorstand wohl der neue Vizechef Kay Gottschalk. Der Bundestagsabgeordnete aus Nordrhein-Westfalen bediente mit rechten Tönen die Erwartungen eines nicht unerheblichen Teils der Delegierten. Die belohnten seine Attacken auf die Anti-AfD-Demonstranten und “die verschissene EU” mit tosendem Applaus und Johlen.

MEUTHEN HÄLT KONFLIKTE FÜR BEREINIGT

Die Reibungen im alten Vorstand seien “nicht unerheblich und phasenweise schwer erträglich” gewesen, erinnerte Meuthen in Anspielung an die inzwischen ausgetretene frühere Co-Vorsitzende Frauke Petry. Die Konflikte seien bereinigt.

Zumindest für die neue Doppelspitze mag das gelten. Gauland, nun in Personalunion Parteivorsitzender und Fraktionschef im Bundestag, setzt auf eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit Meuthen. “Wir werden uns die Arbeit aufteilen”, sagte Gauland und räumte zugleich ein, dass ein zweites Amt eine Schwierigkeit ist. Er hatte sich vor der Wahl klar für Meuthen ausgesprochen. Pazderski unterstützte er dagegen nicht, und dieser fiel durch. Das Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen Pazderskis mit der schleswig-holsteinischen AfD-Chefin Doris von Sayn-Wittgenstein, die unter tosendem Applaus nationale Töne anschlug und sich äußerst EU-kritisch zeigte, offenbart die Risse in der Partei: zwei Wahlgänge, keine Mehrheit, Beratung der Parteitagsleitung, Raunen und Schimpfen in den Gängen. Dann sprang Gauland in die Bresche. Sein Ergebnis fiel 68 Prozent eher mäßig aus, Meuthen erhielt immerhin 72 Prozent.

Es wird sich zeigen, wo künftig die Machtzentrale der AfD liegt: im Bundesvorstand oder in der Fraktion im Bundestag. Dieser fiele bei einer Fortsetzung der großen Koalition die Rolle der Oppositionsführerin zu. Pazderski sieht die Machtzentrale gleichermaßen bei Bundesvorstand und Fraktion. “Das ist eine Symbiose.” Ein Kompetenzgerangel im Vorstand erwarte er nicht. Dort gebe es zwar Bremser. Aber er kenne das Gremium sehr gut. Immerhin gehöre er ihm in unterschiedlichen Funktionen seit 2013 an. “Ich bin am längsten im Bundesvorstand - mit Gauland zusammen.”",AfD zeigt sich in Hannover tief gespalten,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-afd-idDEKBN1DX0H5

Unimpressed with progress on North Korea and market opening, the White House has moved aggressively to target aluminium dumping. This is just an opening salvo in what looks set to be an acrimonious renegotiation of the world’s most important trade relationship.

A laborer works at a steel plant of Shandong Iron & Steel Group in Jinan, Shandong province, China July 7, 2017. Picture taken July 7, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer

The Commerce Department on Tuesday launched a probe into aluminium alloy sheet. The sums involved - $604 million of Chinese imports in 2016 – are economically negligible. What is important is that this was initiated by the government itself, not American companies. This approach circumvents the reluctance of U.S. executives, however dissatisfied with Chinese behaviour, to complain in public for fear of retaliation.

The template will surely be applied to other imports that will sting China harder. And it is just one part of a broader push. Lawmakers want to give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States broader scope to block deals. This will almost certainly target Chinese buyers. CFIUS is already showing signs of getting tougher: Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial continues to wait for clearance to acquire MoneyGram, and other deals have died on the vine. Policymakers are discussing other measures, too, such as tougher rules on Chinese state media.

The key player is the ascendant Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, who views American trade strategy with China as an unmitigated defeat. The bilateral trade deficit, the biggest sore spot of this administration, touched a record monthly high in September, according to Datastream.

Xi also failed to deliver change in North Korea, which Trump explicitly linked to his attitude toward China trade. Pyongyang tested yet another long-range missile on Wednesday - right after a visit from senior Chinese diplomats.

In fact, Xi has moved rapidly to displace American influence and capital, at home and in Asia, Africa and Europe. There is no significant “pro-engagement” faction left in the United States. Even U.S. firms heavily invested in China have started calling for action, although it opens them to retaliation. The Sino-U.S. trade war, brewing for many years, looks set to start boiling in earnest.

Judge Babak Barin suspended the portion of the act banning face coverings until the government enacts guidelines for how the law will be applied and how exemptions might be granted.

The government of the mainly French-speaking province of Quebec now has a chance to clarify in detail how the law would be put into practice.

The law, passed in October, affects everyone from teachers and students to hospital employees, police officers, bus drivers and transit users.

While the law does not single out any religion by name, debate has focused on the niqab, a full-face veil worn by a small minority of Muslim women.

The judge “recognized the immediate harm the law was causing to the people it affects outweighed any theoretical public purpose of the law,” lawyer Catherine McKenzie, who is representing the people challenging the law, told Reuters.

Quebec’s Liberal government is defending the law in court, saying it does not discriminate against Muslim women and is necessary for reasons of security, identification and communication. The act’s name refers to “religious neutrality” and “accommodations on religious grounds.”

“I‘m not unsatisfied with the judgment because there’s no mention that the law contravenes the charters (of rights),” Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard told reporters Friday, as quoted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

The National Council for Canadian Muslims welcomed the ruling “as a successful first step,” its executive director Ihsaan Gardee said.

Opponents of the law say it targets a visible minority that has been subject to threats and violence. Quebec had about 243,000 Muslims as of 2011, according to Statistics Canada, out of a population of 8 million.

In January a gunman walked into a Quebec City mosque and shot six people to death. A French-Canadian university student has been charged as the sole suspect.

Here is a timeline of the following 10 days that will determine whether Britain avoids further costly delays in giving business assurances of a smooth exit from the European Union and of free trade with its biggest market in the future:

PHASE TIME

May wants the EU to open the second phase of Brexit negotiations concerning relations after Britain’s withdrawal on March 30, 2019. The EU will only do that if there is “sufficient progress” in agreeing “divorce” terms, notably on three key issues: a financial settlement, guaranteed rights for EU citizens in Britain and a “soft border” with Ireland.

ONE, TWO, THREE ... PROGRESS

A deal on money is effectively done, EU officials said last week. There were indications of agreement on citizens’ rights and of an understanding of how at least to move forward on the Irish issue to avoid holding up the rest of the package.

BREXIT DANCE STEPS

As part of the “choreography” for a political deal, the EU set May an “absolute deadline” of Monday, Dec. 4, to provide new offers in time for the other EU leaders to approve a move to Phase 2 at a summit of the EU-27 on Friday, Dec. 15.

May is pushing for a simultaneous, reciprocal guarantee from the EU of a soft transition and future trade deal, which she may use to show Britons what her compromises have secured. The EU wants to have firm British offers which the 27 can discuss before leaders commit. The result is some complex dance steps:

Monday, Dec. 4

11 a.m. (1000 GMT) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier meet Guy Verhofstadt and his Brexit team from the European Parliament. The legislature, which must ratify any withdrawal treaty, insists EU judges must have the final say on enforcing citizens’ rights.

1:15 p.m. (1215 GMT) - May joins Juncker and Barnier for lunch at the EU executive’s Berlaymont headquarters. The plan is to sign a joint declaration on progress so far in the talks.

Wednesday, Dec. 6

10 a.m. - Juncker chairs weekly European Commission meeting at which Barnier will update them on progress. The Commission could then say there is sufficient progress to move to Phase 2.

3 p.m. - EU-27 envoys meet to prepare formal decision on sufficient progress to be taken at EU-27 summit on Dec. 15 and to work on draft negotiating guidelines for future trade deal.

Monday, Dec. 11

EU-27 sherpas meet to prepare the summit.

Tuesday, Dec. 12

EU affairs ministers of EU-27 meet to prepare summit.

Thursday, Dec. 14

4 p.m. - May attends routine EU summit in Brussels. Defence, social affairs, foreign affairs and migration are on the agenda.

Friday, Dec. 15

After May has left, EU-27 leaders hold Brexit summit. They could take one comprehensive decision on Phase 2 or break it down into separate ones on the transition and future ties.

January - Outline of EU transition offer may be ready, under which Britain retains all rights except voting in the bloc, and meets all its obligations until the end of 2020.

February - After agreeing their negotiating terms, EU-27 may be ready to open talks with London on a free trade pact that Brussels likens to one it has with Canada.

FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT

The EU estimated at some 60 billion euros ($71 billion) what Britain should pay to cover outstanding obligations on leaving. EU officials say there is now agreement after Britain offered to pay an agreed share of most of the items Brussels wanted, especially for committed spending that will go on after 2020.

Both sides say there is no precise figure as much depends on future developments. British newspaper reports that it would cost up to 55 billion euros sparked only muted criticism from May’s hardline pro-Brexit allies who once rejected big payments.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Saturday that London would be paying the EU 60 billion euros on Brexit.

CITIZENS’ RIGHTS

Barnier is still seeking a commitment that the rights of 3 million EU citizens who stay on in Britain after Brexit will be guaranteed by the European Court of Justice, not just by British judges. May has said the ECJ should play no more role in Britain. But the issue could be vital to ensure ratification of the withdrawal treaty by the European Parliament. A compromise might focus on making clear that the ECJ has a role only for the existing EU residents, whose numbers will shrink over time.

Member states, some of which have taken a tougher line than the Brussels negotiators, are also insisting Britain make concessions on family reunion rules and social benefits.

IRISH BORDER

The EU wants more detail on a British pledge to avoid a “hard border” at the new land frontier on the island of Ireland that might disrupt peace in Northern Ireland. London says the detail depends on the future trade agreement.

EU officials say a hard border can be avoided only if rules remain identical on either side. Northern Ireland could stay in a customs union with the EU. But Britain, and May’s crucial Northern Irish parliamentary allies, insist there should be no new barriers between Northern Ireland and the British mainland.

The EU says that means the whole of the United Kingdom would then have to follow EU rules, something Brexit campaigners do not want. Dublin says it may not be possible to reach a deal on sufficient progress by Monday but in the days after that.

Ireland, with the blessing of the EU-27, says it will veto any move to Phase 2 if Britain’s border offer is unsatisfactory.",Factbox - Countdown to Brexit breakthrough?,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-timeline/factbox-countdown-to-brexit-breakthrough-idUKKBN1DX0HZ

The proposed legislation, which has sparked protests in Israel, would prohibit the police from publicizing whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge a suspect.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to protect Netanyahu and keep the public in the dark regarding ongoing investigations in which he is a suspect, but its supporters said it is intended to protect suspects’ legal rights and reputations.

Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated against the bill in Tel Aviv on Saturday and, as public pressure mounted, support among coalition members for the bill began to wane on Sunday, a day before parliament was expected to ratify it.

“For the debate on the bill to be topical and not be used for political propaganda, I have asked ... that (it) be worded so that it does not cover the ongoing investigations in my matters,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.

With ratification of the legislation delayed, he said he had told the bill’s proponent, David Amsalem, a lawmaker from his own right-wing Likud party, that it had become a “political battering ram against the government.”

But in justifying the legislation, Netanyahu said: “The bill is intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day.”

Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry and the other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.

But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or he could call an election to test whether he still has a mandate to govern.

Netanyahu has in the past said he had no interest in promoting personal legislation but he also did not order the bill’s sponsors, Amsalem, and David Bitan, another Likud confidant, to withdraw it.

Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said he will be cleared. “There will be nothing because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly.

Coalition aircraft bombed Houthi positions in Sanaa overnight, residents and local media said, aiming to shore up supporters of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh as they battle the Houthi group, which is aligned with Iran.

It was the fourth day of clashes in which dozens have been killed, the Red Cross said.

“There is a plane on stand-by in Djibouti for 140 international staff,” a U.N. official in Sanaa told Reuters. About half were from non-governmental organisations, he said.

“Fighting is moving towards the airport and the situation is very tense. We can’t even evacuate staff,” he said.

United Nations staff have been confined to their living quarters in Sanaa since clashes erupted on Thursday, he said.

Shells were falling near the UN compound in Sanaa on Siteen Street on Sunday, with one source on the scene saying stray bullets had hit the compound. The compound is empty as staff had been told to stay home and not report to work for days.

Another aid worker from an independent agency in Yemen, who declined to be identified, told Reuters: “The U.N. is planning a reduction of staff for U.N. agencies and some NGOs.”

“But more importantly they consider that the road to the airport is not safe enough to organise a movement to the airport,” he said, adding that it might involve evacuation of a total of 180 aid workers.

There was no immediate reply from the United Nations to Reuters queries seeking confirmation of the reports.

Clearance to land at Sanaa airport has yet to be received from the coalition, who control the skies over the Houthi-controlled capital, aid workers said.

Saleh said on Saturday he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the coalition fighting in Yemen if it stopped attacks on Yemeni citizens, in a move that could pave the way to end nearly three years of war.

The apparent shift in position came as Saleh’s supporters battled Houthi fighters in Hadda, a district in southern Sanaa where members of Saleh’s family, including his nephew Tareq, live.

Another UN source in Yemen said: “UN and NGO staff are not evacuating, but rather planning a reduction in the number of non-essential staff in Sanaa until the security situation on the ground is clearer.”

The result was another deep embarrassment to big-spending AC Milan who were playing their first match under new coach Gennaro Gattuso, their fiery former midfielder, after sacking Vincenzo Montella on Monday.

Milan twice led but were pegged back after Alessio Romagnoli was sent off for a second booking in the 75th minute.

Brignoli went up to join the attack after his side won a free kick in the fifth minute of stoppage time and, as the ball was whipped in, he met it with a flying header into the bottom corner of the net to spark wild scenes at the modest Stadio Ciro Vigorito.

The 26-year-old became the first goalkeeper to score in Serie A since Massimo Taibi for Reggina in 2001.

Benevento should have gone ahead just after the half hour but Vittorio Parigini sent a free header wide from Marco D‘Alessandro’s cross.

Instead, they found themselves a goal behind when Giacomo Bonaventura headed in at the far post after Benevento missed several chances to clear the danger.

George Puscas snapped up a rebound to give Benevento an equaliser five minutes after halftime but, as so often this season, they undid the good work by quickly conceding another, Nikola Kalinic scoring after being allowed a free header.

Milan, however, handed the initiative to Benevento as the pressure grew after Romagnoli was harshly sent off for a tackle on Gaetano Letizia, even though no contact seemed to be made.

The $68 billion deal will be this year’s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

CVS plans to pay for the deal mostly with cash, but it will also use its own stock to pay for around 30 percent of the purchase price, the sources said. The announcement of the deal could come as early as Sunday, the sources added.

The sources requested not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N).

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

“(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,” said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.",Aetna's board set to approve $68 billion sale to CVS Health: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/aetnas-board-set-to-approve-68-billion-sale-to-cvs-health-sources-idUKKBN1DX0NM

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

Nabors, who later became a star with his own television show “Gomer Pyle, USMC,” died at his home in Hawaii, the website said, citing his office manager.

The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that Nabors had been in declining health for the last few years. He had entered a hospital on Wednesday for tests and asked to be released to go home, his husband Stan Cadwallader told the newspaper.

Nabors’ show business break came in the early 1960s when Andy Griffith saw him in a Los Angeles cabaret - singing in a sophisticated, ear-grabbing voice and telling stories between songs in a Deep South drawl - and offered him a part on “The Andy Griffith Show.”

Griffith’s sitcom - tales of down-home people in a slow-moving Southern town - was one of the most popular on U.S. television at the time and Nabors’ Gomer Pyle character was a hit after joining the cast in 1962.

Gomer was the town’s rustic, kind-hearted gas station attendant who was given to exclamations of “golly” and “shazam” when he was impressed, as well as “surprise, surprise, surprise” and “shame, shame, shame” - depending on the circumstances and stretching each word to several syllables.

After two years on the Griffith show, Nabors was given his own sitcom, “Gomer Pyle, USMC,” with Gomer enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps. It proved to be a viewers’ favorite, sometimes reaching No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings.

As a Marine, Private Pyle was a major screw-up and always at odds with his no-nonsense sergeant. Through it all, he remained pure of heart, sunny of disposition and simple of mind.

After five years of “Gomer Pyle, USMC” Nabors was ready for a different challenge and left the show. His subsequent variety show, “The Jim Nabors Hour,” had a two-year run and he made frequent guest appearances on other television shows.

GOMER STEREOTYPE

Nabors was so strongly identified as Gomer that it limited the roles he was offered. His career was helped along by friend Burt Reynolds, who put him in three of his 1980s movies - “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,” “Stroker Ace” and “Cannonball Run II.”

In 1986 Nabors revived Gomer for the TV movie “Return to Mayberry,” a reunion of “The Andy Griffith Show,” and he kept busy performing in revues, nightclubs and small theaters. Nabors also appeared in several children’s television shows and frequently appeared on friend Carol Burnett’s variety show.

When he wasn’t acting, Nabors was singing in a glorious baritone that made listeners forget all about Gomer Pyle’s hayseed twang. He recorded dozens of albums of country, inspirational and religious music with five of them selling more than 500,000 copies.

Nabors made headlines in January 2013 when he married Cadwallader, a former Honolulu firefighter and his partner of 38 years at that time, in Seattle shortly after the state of Washington made same-sex marriage legal.

Nabors, who moved to Hawaii in the 1980s, told Hawaii News Now that his television colleagues knew he was gay in the 1960s and ‘70s but that he never sought to publicize it because he preferred privacy.

“It’s pretty obvious that we had no rights as a couple, yet when you’ve been together 38 years, I think something’s got to happen there, you’ve got to solidify something,” Nabors said of his marriage. “And at my age, it’s probably the best thing to do.”

Nabors was born June 12, 1930, and grew up in Sylacauga, Alabama, where his father was a police officer. After graduating from the University of Alabama with a business degree, he moved to New York and took a job as a typist at the United Nations. From there, he went to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and worked as a film editor for a television station.

Another film editing job took him to Los Angeles, where he spent off-hours performing at the cabaret where Griffith spotted him.

After the peak of his entertainment career Nabors concentrated on growing macadamia nuts at his farm on the Hawaiian island of Maui.

In February 1994 Nabors suffered from hepatitis B and underwent a liver transplant. He said he contracted the virus several years before in India but it had remained dormant. He underwent heart surgery in June 2012.

Nabors was a fixture at the Indianapolis 500, singing “Back Home Again in Indiana” at the motor race’s opening ceremony more than 35 times.

While Gomer Pyle never rose above the rank of private on television, the Marine Corps made Nabors an honorary Marine with the rank of lance corporal in 2001. He was promoted to full corporal in 2007.","Actor Jim Nabors, TV's 'Gomer Pyle' of 1960s, dies at 87",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1DU2W3-OCAEN

MILANO, 30 novembre (Reuters) - L‘operatore di private equity Terra Firma sta cercando di accelerare la cessione di RTR-Rete Rinnovabile, società a cui fa capo un portafoglio di impianti fotovoltaici per 332 megawatt.

E’ quanto riferiscono tre fonti vicine alla situazione, aggiungendo che il controvalore del deal, in termini di equity value, è pari a 1-1,2 miliardi di euro.

Il via all‘operazione, in cantiere da mesi, è atteso per il prossimo gennaio.

Tra i potenziali acquirenti, secondo le fonti, figurano EF Solare Italia, joint venture tra Enel e F2i.

“Enel-F2i è un compratore naturale, ma parecchi soggetti stanno guardando al deal. E’ un portafoglio di grandi dimensioni, sarà un processo affollato”, spiega una delle fonti.

Nella cessione Terra Firma si avvale della consulenza di UniCredit, JPMorgan e Jefferies.

Dopo aver a lungo valutato l‘ipotesi di vendere gli asset separatamente, Terra Firma ha optato per la cessione in blocco.

Una fonte cita, tra i potenziali acquirenti, Quercus Investment Partners, Tages ed Erg. Un‘altra fonte indica come possibile il coinvolgimento di fondi pensione canadesi e investitori cinesi.

Terra Firma, Quercus, Erg e Tages non hanno voluto commentare. Enel aveva detto nei mesi scorsi che EF Solare avrebbe valutato l‘operazione.

RTR ha chiuso il 2016 con ricavi pari a 146 milioni di euro, un ebitda di 120 milioni e un indebitamento pari a circa 900 milioni.

Una delle fonti sottolinea che l‘acquisizione verrà accompagnata dal rifinanziamento del debito.

As his 20 years as a fixture of U.S. morning television came to an abrupt end, Lauer found himself among the growing ranks of powerful men in U.S. entertainment, politics and media to be felled in recent months by accusations of sexual misconduct.

Lauer said in his statement that some of the accusations against him were “untrue or mischaracterized,” without explaining further, but said that “there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.” Lauer, 59, is married.

He was fired after a female colleague complained to NBC officials on Monday evening about a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior that began while they were on assignment at the 2014 Sochi winter Olympics in Russia, according to NBC statements.

Since then, at least two more women have gone to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer, the “Today” show reported on Thursday. None of the women have been publicly identified.

“Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I‘m committed to beginning that effort,” Lauer said in the statement, which was read by his former co-host Savannah Guthrie at the start of Thursday’s broadcast.

“It is now my full-time job,” the statement said. “The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws.”

Lauer said he was “truly sorry” for pain he had caused.

Reuters has not independently verified the accusations.

NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said the network had never received a complaint about Lauer’s conduct prior to Monday but that “we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.”

Jeff Zucker, a former “Today” show producer who rose up the ranks to become president of NBCUniversal, said he had never heard any complaints against Lauer during his time at the network, where he spent 25 years before joining CNN as president in 2013.

“There was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant, predatory behavior, not even a whisper of it,” Zucker said during the Business Insider IGNITION 2017 conference in New York on Thursday. He called the allegations against Lauer “incredibly disturbing” and sad.

Lauer was promoted to a host of the “Today” show in 1997 and went on to become one of NBC’s highest-paid personalities, reportedly being paid $20 million a year.

The network, owned by Comcast Corp(CMCSA.O), did not respond to questions about its plans for replacing Lauer.

1/ PUT UP OR SHUT UP

It is not only Donald Trump’s tax cut plans, various White House scandals and non-farm payrolls that will keep markets focused on the United States next week. On Friday there is also the small matter of an expiring deadline on funding needed to keep the government open.

Congress can either approve a huge bill which would see Washington though until Sept. 30, 2018, pass a shorter extension of current funding, or do nothing at all and risk a partial shutdown.

The U.S. Treasury also hits its limit on borrowing and although it is likely to take steps to postpone the immediate need for Congress to take action, it all points to yet more U.S. debt.

These rows can also do serious damage. The United States lost its prized triple-A credit rating in 2011 in the aftermath of one such showdown and history shows the uncertainty they cause can have an impact, albeit short-term, on consumer confidence and the jobs numbers.

2/ MUSCLES FROM BRUSSELS

There’s one thing and one thing only that’s driving sterling these days: Brexit.

Look at its gyrations this week. it chalked up its biggest rise in over seven months on Wednesday after EU diplomats said Britain had moved “close” to EU demands over Brexit. It hit a two-month high above $1.35 the following day. On Friday though, it had its biggest fall in three weeks on concerns about the Irish border and media reports that London’s Brexit negotiator David Davis could resign over an internal party issue.

Next week, the Brexit negotiations enter a key phase. Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels for lunch on Monday.

If that meeting is deemed by Brussels to have produced sufficient progress, EU leaders could give a green light to trade talks at a summit on Dec. 14-15, reducing the risk of a “hard Brexit”. Watch the pound.

3/ WE HAVE LIFT-OFF

South Korea became the first major Asian central bank since 2014 to hike interest rates this week. It is a sign the ‘great unwinding’ of crisis-era low interest rates is spreading and resurgent growth in Europe and the United States is benefiting Asia too.

So who is next? Further south, Australia is expected to keep rates on hold next week but there will be focus on whether there is any hint of a possible hike next year.

Malaysia and the Philippines could well nudge rates up next year too, as their booming economies see higher inflation which is pushing ‘real’ interest rates further into the dirt. There is also China trade data which will provide the latest pulse reading for Asia’s industrial powerhouse.

Asian manufacturing expands further, but China remains a risk

4/ BUBBLES BREWING?

Skittishness on tech stocks as bubble fears gain more traction and high expectations for a U.S. tax reform bill have sparked a rotation from the ubiquitously popular tech sector into banks which stand to gain from lower tax rates.

Inflows to U.S. financials stocks hit a 21-week high, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday, while global tech funds, which have drawn some of the biggest flows this year, saw their first outflows in eight weeks after hovering up $6 billion (£4.44 billion) in the past six weeks.

Tech stocks have a fairly low tax rate already, so they’re among the sectors seen as benefiting the least from any tax cuts that eventually materialise.

Tech is also being impacted by fears that valuations, which have reached dizzying heights this year, are floating into bubble territory.

And it is not only stocks. Bitcoin is the other big imponderable. The cryptocurrency smashed through $10,000 and then $11,000 this week, before promptly plunging 20 percent. Who knows what will happen if this particular bubble bursts.

Bubble trouble? Bitcoin tops $11,000, but fades after sharp rally

5/ TALKING TURKEY

Turkey will be in the spotlight again next week as investors await fresh revelations from a U.S. trial involving a Turkish-Iranian gold trader.

Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in the criminal trial of a Turkish Halkbank executive accused of helping to launder money for Iran, has already implicated President Tayyip Erdogan.

Turkey has dismissed the accusations of sanctions-busting as politically-motivated, with the aim of “cornering” Turkey and its economy. The trial is threatening funding for Turkey’s dollar-dependent banks, with investors fretting about potential fines or even sanctions from U.S. regulators.

Markets will also be watching Turkey’s November inflation print, due on Monday. After a battering for the lira it could easily breach 12 percent and that would crank up the pressure for action from the country’s central bank.

“My understanding is that the Senate (bill) has a 20 percent rate now. The House has a 20 percent rate now. We’re happy with both of those numbers,” Mulvaney said in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

“If something small happens in conference that gets us across the finish line, we’ll look at it on a case-by-case basis. But I don’t think you’ll see any significant change in our position on the corporate taxes,” Mulvaney said.",White House open to small changes on corporate tax rate: budget chief Mulvaney,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-mulvaney/white-house-open-to-small-changes-on-corporate-tax-rate-budget-chief-mulvaney-idUSKBN1DX0NK?il=0

Marchionne, who is also chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, recognized there was a big opportunity to win new audiences in the United States but said the sport’s heritage had to be respected.

U.S.-based Liberty, who took over the sport in January, are planning to add at least one North American race to the calendar after 2018 and want to build up the show around grand prix weekends.

“I think it’s fair to say that (F1 chairman) Chase (Carey) and I agree we need space in the United States,” Marchionne told reporters at a presentation on Saturday of Alfa Romeo’s new partnership with the Swiss Sauber team.

Carey also attended the event.

”I think there is an opportunity here, if we do the things right, to make this a relevant sport in the U.S. environment. “And if we do that I think it will benefit the sport tremendously,” added Marchionne.

”But I put a big proviso on this.

“We need to be careful that this desire to make us attractive to the American public doesn’t end up sapping away the DNA of a sport that has some noble origins.”

Marchionne highlighted the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin that saw big fight boxing announcer Michael Buffer present drivers to the crowd individually before the race and then make his signature call of “Let’s get ready to rumble”.

Marchionne, who has dual Italian and Canadian citizenship, said the dignity of the sport must be respected.

”I think we need to preserve it, we need to modernize it in a way which Americans find relevant,“ said Marchionne. ”And that’s the tricky part that I think Chase and I need to walk.

“We’re walking a tightrope on this because if we go too far to try and appeal...”

”The performance down in Austin and the way in which we arranged the show was not what I think a Formula One event ought to be. But it was part of a trial and error exercise, I don’t think it worked incredibly well.

“I think a lot of the Europeans were somewhat taken aback by what happened. We need to find a halfway house that somehow appeases and actually enhances the interest of the public on both sides of the pond.”

Marchionne said a threat made last month to take Ferrari out of the sport after 2020, if Formula One made changes that were not in the Italian team’s interests, was real but there was enough time to sort things out.

The marathon viewing began on Monday evening in London’s Prince Charles Cinema, and concluded on Thursday evening, and was held to mark the upcoming release of the program’s seventh series on DVD on Dec. 11.

“To see (it) all in one chunk will give you something different, that we don’t get when we’re waiting around for the next season to come.

One of the participants described the screening as an “endurance race,” and mindful organizers handed out survival kits containing tissues, alcohol gel and dental supplies.

“Overall, I expect a big increase in Adidas jersey sales in 2018 because of the World Cup. I hope that our teams go as far as possible. After all, we are kitting out three of the favorites with Germany, Spain and Argentina.”

Adidas is the official sponsor of the World Cup and has long been the top supplier of soccer shirts, shoes and balls.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9
