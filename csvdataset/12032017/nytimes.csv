It was in hopes of bringing more clarity to the increasingly tangled question of how endurance training affects hearts that researchers from the University of Minnesota, Stanford University and other institutions decided, for the new study, to zero in on a unique group of runners: men who had participated in at least 25 consecutive Twin Cities marathons in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

These 50 runners, identified by marathon participation logs, turned out to have completed, collectively, 3,510 marathons, with each runner, individually, having finished anywhere from 27 to 171 of the races.

The men obviously were experienced endurance athletes. They had trained for at least 26 years, and some for more than 50. Many had started competing in high school or earlier, but others had come to the sport much later, often, the researchers report, in hopes of ameliorating the effects of past lifestyle choices, such as smoking or junk food diets. Most were lean at the time of the study, but a few qualified as overweight, based on their body mass indexes.

Most ran 30 miles per week or more.

The researchers had each of these runners fill out detailed questionnaires about their training routines, as well as their general health history and habits.

Then they scanned the runners’ hearts to look for atherosclerosis.

Sixteen of the runners proved to have no plaque in their arteries at all. The rest had some deposits, with 12 displaying slight amounts, another 12 moderate levels, and 10 having worrisomely large deposits of plaques.

When the scientists compared the men’s running histories to their scan results, however, they found little relationship between how much they had run overall and how much plaque they had in their arteries. Those men who had run the greatest number of marathons did not tend to have less, or more, arterial plaque than the men who had run fewer races, indicating that extreme running itself had not increased the severity of heart disease.

On the other hand, a history of heavy smoking and high cholesterol was linked to greater levels of plaque, especially in the men who had begun running later in life.

The good news was that these findings suggest that years of hard running had not harmed the men’s hearts, says Dr. William O. Roberts, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of Minnesota, who led the study, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Indeed, all that running probably helped to keep some runners’ arteries clear.

But the exercise also had not inoculated those with a history of unwise lifestyle choices, especially smoking, against developing heart disease.

“You can’t just outrun your past,” Dr. Roberts says.

Of course, this study was relatively small and focused on Caucasian men with the physical, economic and psychological wherewithal to run competitively for years. Whether the results apply equally to other people and other sports is unclear. (Dr. Roberts and his collaborators published a small study earlier this year of female marathon runners that found almost no plaques in their hearts.)

This type of study also can show only relationships between running and heart health. It cannot prove that running directly caused any changes in the heart.

Still, the results may help to quell some runners’ and their families’ worries about the cardiac demands of long-term training. But if you misspent your youth smoking and eating poorly or have a family history of cardiac disease, you might want to talk with your physician about having your heart assessed, Dr. Roberts says, even if you have completed a marathon or two, or even 100.",How Running May or May Not Help the Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/well/move/running-marathons-heart-health.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Two kinds of dancers pack the salsa clubs of Cali, Colombia. There are the purists, who like to keep their footwork on the ground, the way salsa was first danced in the 1970s. Then there are the more daring — typically younger — provocateurs, who incorporate demanding tricks and lifts frowned upon by traditionalists. If you’re keen on finding a partner, you may want to stick to the original formula.

Though it can be found in clubs all over the world now, salsa is still a relatively new dance form. Born in New York City from a mix of music and steps from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Harlem, it came of age in the early 1970s. Alfredo Caicedo Viveros, a salsa historian in Cali, said it wasn’t long before Colombian sailors brought the new trend back with them. “People would say, ‘Do you want to listen to some music from New York?’” he recalled. “It was so rhythmic! It made you move!”

Not long after, dance clubs called salsatecas sprang up in Cali, especially in the working-class neighborhood of the Barrio Obrero. Colombian musicians began forming salsa bands to make their own contributions to the growing scene. Mr. Caicedo cited Grupo Niche, Orquesta Guayacán, Orquesta La Identidad and La Gran Banda Caleña as some of the most popular bands in the early days of Colombian salsa.

Taking its name from the city that developed it, the Cali style developed from a mix of pachanga (a dance best recognized for its shuffled side-to-side steps), charanga (a riff on a traditional Cuban dance) and boogaloo (another form born in New York City, which mixes several styles) dances.

Over time, the Cali style continued to evolve. “We have here a well-known school by Luis Eduardo Hernández (also known as El Mulato), who founded the Swing Latino school,” Mr. Caicedo said. Mr. Eduardo introduced a new element to salsa, Mr. Caicedo said, “which was acrobatics. You know, what they do in the circus — the somersaults.”

The photographer Rose Marie Cromwell came across Cali’s vibrant salsa scene almost by accident. “I heard people tell me that Cali was the capital of the salsa,” she said. It was enough to pique her interest.

“I first went to NellyTeca, brought there by a friend in her late 20s,” Ms. Cromwell said. “Even though the salsa scene mostly consists of older people, she knew about this salsateca so she brought us there. It was packed with people and loud with salsa music. Lots of characters, lots of interesting people.”

That first salsateca also gave Ms. Cromwell some of her favorite memories of the assignment. “NellyTeca was so friendly, so close,” she said. “It kind of got rowdy, and I like that energy. I liked the small ones, that was an experience. It’s where two older ladies were having a beer in the corner, and older couples were dancing together on a small floor. It was bittersweet and romantic. It felt like I traveled back in time.”

Mr. Caicedo’s generation was the first to dance in salsatecas. He met his wife at a dance more than four decades ago. As one of the elder statesmen of the form, Mr. Caicedo still prefers the old-fashioned style, free of showmanship. “We dance on the floor — that’s the Cali style, which is the nice one,” he said. “We show our respect to the ladies. She doesn’t have to be dropped on the floor, and you don’t have to take her by her foot to put her in the air.”

You’ll have an easier time finding the traditional Cali style in a viejoteca, a salsateca that specializes in playing salsa music for a typically older group of dancers. “There’s a loyalty in Cali to the way it was danced, the way people dressed,” Ms. Cromwell said. “Maybe because Colombia was isolated for so long, it stayed the same.”

Once an exercise class for the elderly in the early 1990s, the viejoteca became a refuge for Cali-style purists, according to Mr. Caicedo. Now, viejotecas are weekend parties that start in the afternoon and wind down around 10 p.m. It’s a very different scene from New York, where salsa dancing normally begins in the late evening. Cali’s earlier start time also cuts down the drinking hours. “Not everyone’s drinking. It’s more of a social event, not a drinking event,” Ms. Cromwell said.

There are other differences separating Cali styles and stateside styles. Most of the salsa dancing in the United States requires couples to move back and forth on the dance floor. In Cali, couples move from side to side like a mirror image. Their upper body and arms are supposed to remain still while their feet quickly work through steps that look like a Latin-tinged jive.

Depending on the style you’re dancing in the United States, the motion can vary from big showy gestures and spins to tightly controlled movements confined to the couple’s personal space.

Yet other characteristics remain the same between salseros. The steps are always fast, and the hips are meant to move. The couple should hold onto each other, with the follower reading every change in the leader’s position as a signal for the next move.

“Now, rich people, poor people, everybody dances it. No matter your creed, ideology, gender or partisanship,” Mr. Caicedo said. “You can choose how you want to dress. If you want to dress to honor the old times, you can dress like a dancer. Otherwise, you can enjoy it, but you use your regular clothes.”

Throughout salsatecas large and small, there’s an unmistakable look of focus and energy on the faces of professional and recreational dancers. Some are smiling while holding onto their partners. Others are concentrating on remembering their rehearsed choreography. The dancers on the sidelines watch on or catch their breath. Women wave fans for a cool breeze, and men dry themselves off with handkerchiefs.

Ms. Cromwell said the experience was entertaining to watch and to document. “It was a really fun scene, the dancers were so animated,” she said. “Colombians are an open culture. Everyone wanted to share about Cali, it’s not a touristy scene there.”

No matter the style, that thrill of dancing is always the same. “Salsa evokes human feelings,” Mr. Caicedo said. “It makes me feel ecstatic when I dance. It makes me express that feeling with my limbs, because I feel joy.”

Meeting Mr. Hertwig that day in the waiting room was “a total fluke” and “surreal,” she said.
She found talking with the husband of the woman that her husband was having an affair with more therapeutic than any therapy session.

She had gone to see the therapist, she said, because she and her husband had met with the woman previously for marriage counseling. Ms. Chaulk wanted to get answers from someone who knew and understood her situation. It turned out that person was not the therapist, but Mr. Hertwig.

Indeed, one ponders the mysterious ways of chance and fate after learning that Ms. Chaulk visited the therapist just once (after couples counseling). Meeting Mr. Hertwig that day in the waiting room was “a total fluke” and “surreal,” she said.

She found talking with the husband of the woman that her husband was having an affair with more therapeutic than any therapy session.

For one thing, she was able, through Mr. Hertwig, to “piece together some of the timeline,” she said, to better know what had happened by comparing their spouses’ behavior and schedules over the previous months. “I’ll never get the full story,” she said. “But having some sense helped me find some closure and move on.”

It also helped that Mr. Hertwig knew exactly what she was going through because he was going through it, too. “With some of my friends, they were so angry on my behalf and I didn’t want the anger,” Ms. Chaulk said. “Whereas Benjamin and I could express a wide spectrum of feelings. It was a safe place to do it, and more productive.”

Mr. Hertwig, looking back on the encounter four years later, had a similar assessment of his conversations with Ms. Chaulk, who had “experienced the flip side of the coin,” he said. Being able to talk to her likewise for him made the therapist largely unnecessary. What was more helpful, he said, was “the feeling of looking across at someone who had experienced much of what I experienced and felt what I had felt.”

Mr. Hertwig is a former soldier who had served in Afghanistan, a difficult experience he was struggling with. In his essay, he said he was “attracted to her strength — maybe to her as well.” How did Ms. Chaulk feel in that moment?

For so long in her relationship with her husband, she said, “I’d been lying to my friends and everyone, pretending all was well when it wasn’t. During that time in the cafe, I was willing to look it in the eye and embrace it and make a plan. That was the first time I was honest with myself and how I was feeling.”

If she felt a similar romantic spark toward Mr. Hertwig, it was because they were communicating honestly, she said, “and because we so clearly were on the same page. We had some very similar values. Being able to share that with someone was intimate in its own way.”

These days, Ms. Chaulk is a nurse in the same Canadian city where the story takes place. She is divorced from her husband, with whom she shares custody of their son, and is currently in a long-term relationship.

Every now and then, she said, she dusts off Mr. Hertwig’s essay. “Rereading it puts me back in a place where I was the most honest I’ve been with myself,” Ms. Chaulk said. “I use that story as a checkpoint so that I maintain that.”

Mr. Hertwig is now a Ph.D. student in English in Vancouver, British Columbia. He said he has more emotional distance from both his divorce and his military service, and better understands how the two were interconnected. He recently published a book of poetry, “Slow War,” that deals with these topics.

Mr. Hertwig is no longer in contact with his ex-wife. He has been dating the same woman for several years, and he also communicates with Ms. Chaulk every so often through Facebook. Despite their brief interaction, and the unhappy circumstances under which it took place, Mr. Hertwig said he will always feel “linked” to her, even as the years pass.

“Because however brief, it was important to me,” he said.

Super Cruise was introduced in September and is General Motors’ answer to Tesla’s Autopilot, the best known of the semiautonomous driving systems that have arrived in the past two years. Neither Autopilot nor Super Cruise is fully autonomous — both require drivers to remain alert and prepared to take control at any time.

But Super Cruise has one big advantage: Unlike Autopilot, it does not require you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. As I’m typing this, a camera mounted on the steering column is monitoring my eyes and head. As long as I glance up every so often, Super Cruise knows that I’m keeping an eye on the road.

For more than an hour, Super Cruise pilots the car with no input from me — no steering, no braking and no acceleration. In that time, I cover 65 miles. With my hands free, I scroll through Twitter and Facebook. I log into my bank account and read the headlines from The New York Times.

As long as I look up at the road about every three seconds, Super Cruise remains in command, maintaining a safe following distance and easing the Cadillac through the freeway’s contours. When Super Cruise is engaged, a thin light strip on the top of the steering wheel appears green. If I look away longer than three seconds, it flashes to bring my gaze back on the highway. If I fail to do so, the light strip turns red and the driver’s seat vibrates, telling me to take control.

That has happened only once so far. To get Super Cruise back, I need only look forward and place my hands on the wheel. After a few seconds, the light strip turns green again, and my hands are free to go back to the iPhone.

I quickly learn how to glance regularly at the road. My host in South Bend, my cousin Pat, calls me using the video chat function in Facebook Messenger. I hold the phone up over the steering wheel so that I can see Pat on the screen while keeping my gaze looking forward, ensuring Super Cruise remains in control.

All the while, the CT6 stays centered in the left lane of I-94. But if I want to change lanes or to pass other cars, I take the wheel myself and steer the car over. The light strip turns blue, indicating I’m temporarily overriding Super Cruise. Once the car is in the new lane, the strip goes back to green and I’m hands-free again. It decelerates when approaching slower vehicles. When the road clears, it accelerates back up to the speed I’ve selected: 74 m.p.h., four over the speed limit.

At one point, a car merging onto the highway scoots in front of me. Super Cruise responds quickly and brakes. I sense no danger of a collision.

G.M. is careful to specify that it is not promoting Super Cruise as a way to let drivers text, Google or open a newspaper on the highway. “We don’t recommend it,” said Lisa Sieradski, global product manager for the CT6. “It will allow you to glance down at a phone or the radio, but you have to return your eyes to the road.”

Nonetheless, using the same video-chatting method, I watch a four-minute highlight video from a Rangers game. (They beat the Bruins, 4-2.) I also conduct a phone interview, taking notes with a pen and a pad. When my trip ended, I had covered 378 miles. My hands were on the wheel for no more than 25 of them.

Ms. Sieradski said G.M. had tried to engineer Super Cruise to keep drivers safe — and limit opportunities to use the system improperly — by restricting how and where they could use it. The system will not operate at speeds above 85 mile per hour, for example.

And Super Cruise can be activated only on divided, limited-access highways such as interstates — places where it need not contend with intersections, traffic lights and pedestrians. The system determines its exact location by relying on high-precision digital maps and GPS technology, while sensors track the surrounding traffic — the way sensors do for driver aides like adaptive cruise control. The system is able to determine when the car is on a service road along the highway, or even on entry and exit ramps — locations where it requires you to steer yourself.

But when the Super Cruise system senses it is on an approved road, a white steering wheel icon appears on the instrument panel. Press a button, and the green bar lights up and the system takes over.

For now, Super Cruise is available only on the 2018 CT6. Dealers in Michigan are offering the car with the option for about $73,000.

The ability to cruise on the highway hands-free is a major step forward. For many drivers, systems that require them to keep their hands on the steering wheel seem almost self-defeating. What’s the point of having the car steer itself if your hands have to stay on the wheel?

While driving the CT6 over several days, I found it was actually more pleasing to leave my phone alone. One morning at rush hour, I sat quietly with my hands on my knees, sipping a latte as though I were relaxing on my couch.

On the return leg of my South Bend trip, I turned on the back massager built into the CT6’s driver’s seat. From my phone, I piped a new-age meditation through the CT6’s sound system.

As I stared at the truck ahead of me, and the seat kneaded my lower back, I crossed the border into the state of Zen. The voice on the meditation intoned: “You are feeling relaxed and calm.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — The theme topic of Peter Gordon’s crossword is something that most people remember learning in English or writing classes in school, but which is largely forgotten until a puzzle like today’s comes along and makes you think “Oh yeah! That’s pretty cool.”

Today’s Theme

Mr. Gordon offers us a seemingly disparate list of names and phrases but, this being a theme, they all have one thing in common. They all use ALLITERATION, the revealer at 18D, although Mr. Gordon has added an interesting twist: These entries are alliterative in sound, not in initial letter.

For example, at 47A, the “Dish made with romaine lettuce, croutons and Parmesan cheese” is a CAESAR SALAD, where both words in the entry begin with the same “S” sound, but not the same letter.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — My first reaction upon filling in the first theme entry (18A) in Erik Agard’s puzzle was, “Hey! It’s the Supremes!” I know, the real answer did not refer to the award-winning singing group, but by the time I finished and got the revealer at 74A, I realized that it actually did.

That is some nice thematic whiplash for a Wednesday, Mr. Agard. Nicely done.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Agard’s theme comes just in time for the cold weather we’ve been experiencing in the northeast. I have never heard a MOTOWN song that hasn’t made me want to get up and dance, and that keeps the blood moving.

The first word in each of the theme entries is a singular member of a MOTOWN group: The SUPREMEs, The CONTOURs, The MIRACLEs and The TEMPTATIONs.

Mr. Agard’s puzzles typically have entries in them that are tough for some solvers to get, but this one felt very accessible. He has also embiggened his grid and increased the maximum word count, but I don’t mind that. There are plenty of fun entries — including not one but two types of Japanese noodles, RAMEN and UDON — and the puzzle doesn’t feel crowded to me at all.

Giving tourists the opportunity to participate in science is fun and empowering, and deepens their commitment to conservation, said Darcy Bradley, a postdoctoral researcher at University of California Santa Barbara.

“The fact that we can all be citizen scientists is a really important and special thing,” said Dr. Bradley, who was not involved in the paper, but gets regular emailed updates when whale sharks she’s submitted to the database get spotted again. “We need more stewards for the environment.”

The animals that have been spotted are mostly juvenile males, measuring about 12 to 21 feet, although a site in the Galápagos recorded mostly females. It’s not clear where the adults live, though it is presumed that they are in the open ocean, said Dr. Brad Norman, the paper’s first author.

Whale sharks are covered with spots and can be individually identified by the pattern of spots on their sides, just behind the gills, above the pectoral fin, said Dr. Norman, also founder and principal research scientist with Ecocean, a nonprofit based in Western Australia.

“The ability to photo-identify species — and indeed the whale shark was the first shark we could do this for — has transformed our ability to understand how many individuals are out there, who is moving where, how far do they go, and how many are staying around,” said Nicholas Dulvy, a professor of marine biodiversity and conservation at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, who was not involved in the research.

Whale sharks were declared endangered last year after their numbers apparently dwindled. They are often illegally fished or caught as by-catch along with tuna, Dr. Dove said. Many are also struck by ships. Unlike whales, their bodies sink, so it is hard to know how many are hit, he said, describing the animals as gentle, polka-dotted and slow-moving. “This is a shark that lives in first gear,” he said.

The juvenile males don’t appear to migrate much, Dr. Norman said, with many seen repeatedly in the same region, and not much mixing across the hot spots.

The lack of sightings of fully mature adults means scientists don’t have a good idea of what the animals are doing, where they are living or their mating habits. Whale sharks are unlikely to have specific grounds where they give birth, because of long gestation periods, and the fact that no more than one or two pups have been found in the same place and time, the study said.

Even their numbers are a mystery. Worldwide, estimates of the population range from about 20,000 to about 200,000 whale sharks, Dr. Dulvy said.

In captivity, where scientists see the animals over time, it becomes clear that they have distinctive personalities, Dr. Dove said. “We get to know the bossy one, the shy guy.”

Though less familiar, some of the wild animals have been seen enough to earn nicknames, he said, citing two in Mexico: Rio Lady, and Keyhole, who has a distinctive hole on one fin. “They begin to have stories and narratives and lives that you can follow along with,” he said. “That’s one of the things that adds a layer of fun for the citizen-scientist.”

Dr. Norman, who is in the Maldives studying whale sharks, said there’s nothing like the joy of being near the animals — or watching first timers do it. “You’re swimming with the biggest fish in the sea. Sometimes you’re in water hundreds of meters deep,” he said. As long as a person stays 10 to 15 feet away from the animal’s path and does not try to touch it, swimming alongside the animals should be safe.

“They’re so graceful, they’re so beautiful,” he said. “All fear or trepidation goes and you’re just in awe.”",Tracking the Elusive Whale Shark,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/science/whale-sharks.html

The federal government will run out of money and close its doors this month unless Congress can agree on a new spending bill. That’s one of several important pieces of business, albeit the most pressing, left unfinished during Republicans’ frantic drive to complete a tax bill.

Here are some others.

■ Nine million children covered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, have been waiting since Sept. 30 for Congress to renew the program. States are struggling to keep the program afloat; on Monday Colorado began sending letters to the families of 75,000 children and pregnant women, warning them that after Jan. 31 they’re on their own.

■ About 700,000 young people born to undocumented immigrants and at risk of deportation await a legislative alternative to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which, thanks to President Trump, is scheduled to end in March.

■ Victims of Western wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria are still waiting for tens of billions of dollars in additional federal aid promised weeks ago.

SYDNEY, Australia — Almost 30 years after an American mathematician’s body was found at the bottom of a Sydney cliff, a coroner has concluded that he was the victim of an anti-gay hate crime.

Since 1988, Scott Johnson’s family has lived with uncertainty over how the 27-year-old fell to his death off the North Head cliffs. On Thursday, Magistrate Michael Barnes, the state coroner, said he was “persuaded to the requisite standard Scott Johnson died as a result of a gay hate attack.”

The inquest was the third into Mr. Johnson’s death. The first, in 1989, ruled it a suicide. But years later, as evidence emerged that gangs had been attacking gay men in the cliffs around Sydney during the 1980s and ’90s, Mr. Johnson’s family began petitioning for a second inquest, which was held in 2012. It overturned the suicide ruling and recommended that the police reinvestigate.

Former Australian officials have said the police at that time were often hostile toward gay men and complacent about investigating their deaths. In 2013, the police of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, opened a review of 88 deaths of men between 1976 and 2000 to determine whether they should be reclassified as hate crimes.

The four men awaiting sentencing on Monday — Kenny Kwan, Charles Lai, Raymond Lam and Sheldon Wong — pleaded guilty in May to charges including voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension.

The four of them — as well as another student, Daniel Li — had initially been charged with third-degree murder, which does not involve premeditation or a specific intent to kill, but their charges were reduced after an agreement with prosecutors. Mr. Li reached a separate agreement to reduce his charges after he cooperated with prosecutors.

Legal experts have cited the case as an example of prosecutors taking a harder line in pursuing criminal charges after college students are killed while being hazed. In another Pennsylvania case, at least two dozen people have been charged after a 19-year-old Penn State University student, Timothy Piazza, died in February after a “pledge night” of drunken partying.

THE WOODLANDS, Tex. — Leslie Martinez heard the floodwaters before she saw them. They rushed across the lawn, seeped around the doors and into the house. It was 2:15 a.m. on Aug. 28, three days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. Her young daughter was asleep in her arms. Ms. Martinez’s first reaction was to spread towels around the floor.

After all, Ms. Martinez recalled, the home builder had assured her that “flooding was not even a possibility” when she and her husband purchased the house in this suburban enclave north of Houston in 2011. They would never have bought here otherwise. Flood insurance, of course, was neither required nor needed.

Now, with the rains outside lashing and the water inside rising, the family and their terrified pet, a one-eyed goldendoodle named Coco, took refuge on the second floor. Later that day, rescue boats came and ferried them to safety.

The flooding forced Ms. Martinez and her husband, John Ahearn, to borrow money from their parents and accept a donation from their daughter’s school. It left them feeling furious and betrayed. “I’m scared that it’s going to continue happening,” Ms. Martinez said, even as she wondered how they had become the victims of something they had been told had a vanishingly small chance of coming to pass in such a short time since the purchase.

What they did not know was that their home, and those of many of their flooded-out neighbors in this new section of The Woodlands, had been built on land that not long ago lay squarely, and sometimes soggily, in a flood plain.

A New York Times examination found that in the years leading up to Hurricane Harvey, with a surging local economy fueling demand for new upscale housing, the developers of The Woodlands had used a wrinkle in the federal flood-mapping system — along with many dump trucks’ worth of dirt — to lift dozens of lots out of the area officially deemed prone to flooding. What they had done, in effect, was create gerrymandered maps of risk.

In Ms. Martinez’s case, documents show, the land was raised less than 10 inches above the level that, under federal flood-insurance rules, would have required the family to be notified of their risk and purchase insurance. Other lots in their area were raised as little as 1.2 inches above that height.

No one has suggested that the developers broke any laws, and the company that owns The Woodlands says it followed all applicable regulations and standards. But the experiences of the family of Ms. Martinez and their neighbors show that even when the mapping rules are followed to the letter, the results can be disastrous.

The adjustment process began as a way to correct the wild inaccuracies in the maps that form the basis of the federal flood-insurance program, which was created in the 1960s to protect homeowners from catastrophic loss. Increasingly, though, the changes have also become a way for developers to build on low-lying land.

Across the country, documents show, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the insurance program, has granted more than 150,000 map changes in the last five years. In some cases, lots were raised, and in others, levees, drainage systems, water-detention ponds and other methods changed the calculated flood risk for a swath of land.

Many of these changes were unquestionably appropriate. But in the Houston area, a Times analysis of FEMA documents shows, at least 6,000 properties in redesignated zones were damaged during the flooding caused by Harvey.

“This is all about engineers doing things for developers rather than for the public,” said James B. Blackburn, co-director of the Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters Center at Rice University in Houston. Mr. Blackburn, who was involved in early designs of The Woodlands, added, “It would be nice to know that you were only two inches above the flood plain. You know, that’s not a lot of margin for error on these maps. Yet all the federal protection for flood insurance gets removed.”

What happened in The Woodlands underscored one of the great lessons of Harvey’s assault on Houston: the profound vulnerability of a metropolis with an ethos of untrammeled development built, essentially, on a swamp.

To Ms. Martinez and her neighbors, the cruel twist was that it could happen here — in a community founded in 1974 as a kind of anti-suburbia by an oil and gas billionaire named George P. Mitchell. If The Woodlands was a community apart, rich with woods, lakes, trails and streams, Mr. Mitchell was its benevolent dictator, whose vision of building quality and environmental balance fostered a reputation of a development where the flood risk was extremely low.

Mr. Mitchell sold his company’s stake in The Woodlands Development Company in 1997, and the community has been steered by a succession of publicly traded companies — most recently, the Howard Hughes Corporation, which bought a major stake in 2010 and acquired the rest the next year.

Don Hickey, a 37-year resident of The Woodlands who was an early employee of Mr. Mitchell, said people paid more to live here in part because they felt they would be safe. Mr. Hickey, who works in real estate finance and is collaborating with fellow homeowners to get their flooding problems fixed, summarized the situation in caustic terms, saying, “The developer had an economic benefit to more aggressively develop land around the flood plain or spend less money on flood control.”

The company says there has been no slippage of quality through the transition of ownership.

“Since development began at The Woodlands more than four decades ago, it has strived to be a model master-planned community. While ownership has changed, what has never changed — nor will ever change — is our strict adherence to standards and our commitment to our communities,” said Grant Herlitz, president of the Howard Hughes Corporation.

Hurricane Harvey, the company argues, was an exceptional flooding event, and all map revisions followed federal and local guidelines. “To the extent that standards are re-evaluated, we will do as we have always done and act in accordance with any new regulations,” Mr. Herlitz said.

Boundaries of Risk

The National Flood Insurance Program and the flood maps used to establish the need for insurance have been a constant source of controversy. Critics of the program argue that it often ends up repeatedly paying for damaged properties instead of pressing for mitigation of flood risks and relocation, and thus ends up encouraging people to build — and rebuild — in risky places.

The risk is defined by law, not nature: FEMA and the flood insurance program look to what is known as 100-year flood elevation to determine who needs to buy insurance. Anything lower than that is considered to be in the flood plain. Above that level, supposedly, is safety.

But how safe? The 100-year flood level does not mean a flood will happen only once every 100 years. Instead, it refers to a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year. (A 500-year flood, which reaches somewhat higher elevation, is one with a .2 percent chance of occurring in a year.) That 1 percent chance actually translates into a one-in-four chance of a flood occurring at least once during the life of a 30-year mortgage. And in Houston, as in many parts of the country, 100-year floods are distressingly common. The Houston area saw three such events in the past three years. Climate change threatens to make them even more likely.

To Mr. Blackburn, the 100-year line is too arbitrary for comfort. What’s more, the flood maps have long been considered highly inaccurate.

This led to a lot of unhappiness among homeowners forced to pay perhaps $5,000 annually for insurance that would cost less than a tenth of that outside the official flood plain.

“People started to come in and argue and said, ‘You showed me in a flood plain and I’m 40 feet above that level.’ Because FEMA’s topography was so inaccurate,” said Larry A. Larson, director emeritus of the Association of State Floodplain Managers in Madison, Wis.

By the 1980s, he said, the agency, too overwhelmed and underfinanced to make all the corrections itself, instituted new procedures for accepting revised elevation data from engineers hired by aggrieved citizens.

Developers have taken advantage of the new system as well, FEMA documents show, with a range of techniques from hiring surveyors to correct elevations to building structures like levees and drainage channels. In one of the most common methods, developers truck in tons of soil — known as “fill” in the building trade — and dump it over wide areas to raise the elevation above the flood plain. Mr. Larson called changes that lifted the ground only slightly above the flood plain “a bad idea” because such areas generally remain prone to flooding.

“Once a flood plain, always a flood plain,” he said. “It’s still got risk.”

His observation was borne out in striking fashion in the neighborhoods covered by the two map revisions examined by The Times: Eighty of the 81 homes within those areas near Spring Creek — which flows through The Woodlands — sustained some degree of flooding, according to FEMA statistics.

Harris County, home to large parts of suburban Houston, including the newer sections of The Woodlands, is one of a handful of districts around the nation that FEMA has granted a sort of shared authority in approving map revisions. Although the conditions of this authority are complex, and vary from district to district, others have used it to enforce standards that are more stringent — for example, generally requiring higher elevations for any change and pushing developments further from creeks than FEMA does.

For its part, Harris County has stuck with FEMA’s elevation standards. “We don’t want to touch the FEMA process; we want to keep it intact,” said Ataul Hannan, planning division director for the Harris County Flood Control District.

What the county has done is put a great deal of effort, and expense, into creating special software model for more accurately calculating flooding risks and the wider effects of development in the relatively flat terrain of the Houston area, Mr. Hannan said. Comparing Harris County’s regulations to those in other parts of the country is unfair, he added, because the topographies are so different.

In the business of flood-map revision, the pressure usually runs one way. There is seldom much local interest in having a neighborhood declared flood prone, said Sarah Pralle, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University who studies the politics of flood insurance and has written about lobbying efforts by New York and New Orleans to alter the maps.

“The shrinkage of the flood maps,” she said, “is always treated in a very positive way.”

Shifting Terrain

As early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing “wooded areas and a few rural home sites,” according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market.

Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years.

That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve.

“This would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,” Mr. Gilmer said.

FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek — including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there “when it wasn’t flooded.”

By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show.

The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place — Ms. Martinez’s street — 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place — Mr. Hickey’s street — and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas.

The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Seañez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, “They said, ‘You don’t even have to purchase it,’” Ms. Seañez recalled.

Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey’s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. “We see that the flood plain was revised recently,” the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck.

A number of residents asked whether managers of The Woodlands since Mr. Mitchell had been as careful as its predecessors in designing the newer developments, and pointed to what they called more aggressive policies since the Howard Hughes Corporation — a brand revived in 2010 by the activist investor Bill Ackman — took over.

Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent — a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent.

In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Seañez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected — a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns.

“They’ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody’s business,” he said. “Our name for it is not The Woodlands, it’s Concrete Land.”

The company stated that “the senior development team is ‘essentially the same team’ that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.”

Tim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm’s waters. “We met the standard,” he said. “This event exceeded the standard.”

Still, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey — and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.

Steve English, 71, said the value of his house has dropped to $400,000 from $800,000 after the two floods. Hurricane Harvey brought 30 inches of water into his home.

“Do we all have to get to where our house is down to $50 and we have to walk out of here naked before you do anything?” he said.

Any fixes could take years, and are quite likely to require coordinating efforts among communities and the state of Texas. Until then, homeowners stew, fret and wait for the next big storm. Raul Giorgi, a real estate agent in The Woodlands for 35 years, owns a home near the Soeders that also was damaged.

He made the same decision to buy there that his customers make — and, like his clients, his ability to dig through years of regulatory decisions and paperwork is limited. They look to real estate agents like him, he said, for information about risks, and he looks to the developers. “Who am I? I’m not an engineer,” he said. “All I can do is trust the experts.”

Now, he says, “I personally believe, in hindsight, this should not have been developed.”

While many women said colleges had not been taking assault complaints seriously, some schools were criticized for overreacting, and in September, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced she was revising government policy to, among other things, give accused students more rights.

Two weeks later, the first explosive report about Harvey Weinstein was published, and before long colleges found themselves confronting the problem anew.

Stanford University said it was reviewing allegations against Franco Moretti, a professor emeritus, after a blog post by a former graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.

“He was cool. He was hip,” Kimberly Latta, a psychotherapist in Pittsburgh, wrote last month in a post titled “What Happened at Berkeley in 1985.”

“I was 25 and very naïve.”

She accused Mr. Moretti, then a visiting professor in comparative literature, of raping her when she was a graduate student — allegations he has denied.

“I was just inspired by all the women coming forward about Harvey Weinstein,” Ms. Latta said in an interview, explaining why she had decided to go public. “People are believing these women. Maybe they’ll believe me, too.”

In an email, Mr. Moretti, who is now in Europe, said that the encounter was consensual and that he was “horrified by the allegations.”

At the University of Virginia, three former students filed complaints last month against John Casey, a writing professor who won the 1989 National Book Award for his novel “Spartina.”

One student, Emma Eisenberg, who received her master’s in creative writing in 2014, claimed that Mr. Casey repeatedly touched her and other female students on their “shoulders, buttocks and lower backs and made sexual and gender-based comments,” according to a university document.

In an email, Ms. Eisenberg explained why she was coming forward now.

“In my gut I knew there was something wrong about those experiences, but it was so openly talked about within the program that I figured I was overreacting,” she said. “Seeing this recent flood of women coming forward confirmed what I had always known — his behavior was problematic and inappropriate.”

The university said it was investigating the complaints, and Mr. Casey, who was on sabbatical this semester, has been barred from teaching in the spring. In an email, Mr. Casey said it “would be premature and possibly improper to discuss a matter that has scarcely begun.”

At the University of Southern California, officials said they had received an “uptick” in complaints since the first Weinstein reports, many of them describing a comparable dynamic: a man who is powerful in his field, mistreating younger women who depend on him for career advancement. Some of the reports named professors long gone from the university, while others accused men still teaching there.

In a letter to the campus on Oct. 29, the provost, Michael Quick, announced he was convening a series of forums and task forces. “There is no place on our campuses, or in our society, for abuse of power,” it said.

And in Atlanta, the issue is gripping two campuses, and exposed a deep fissure between schools closely linked by history and geography.



Neither Spelman nor Morehouse would disclose how many complaints it has received, and in interviews, Spelman students and professors said they did not believe sexual assault was any more common there than elsewhere.

But most said they believed the colleges had not been taking the issue seriously enough. Now their pent-up frustration has burst into the open during a national moment of reckoning.

“I don’t believe our students would be doing what they’re doing if things like this hadn’t been happening nationally,” said Beverly Guy-Sheftall, a women’s studies professor who was one of more than 70 Spelman professors who signed an open letter supporting students who said they had been assaulted.

In a three-minute speech on Nov. 9, the day the graffiti was found on the King chapel, Harold Martin Jr., the interim president of Morehouse, said there was “clearly a belief that there is a population that does not feel heard.”

“We will do the work,” he said, encouraging victims to come forward. (Almost all of the names on Twitter had been posted anonymously.) “Nobody has come by my office, but I hope you will.”

The issue was particularly painful for Spelman students, who spoke of a shared legacy with Morehouse that gave them great pride and, they said, could be perversely discouraging victims from coming forward or assailants from being punished.

The institutions were founded more than 130 years ago, when black students were all but banned from most American colleges. Their students have included some of the most prominent figures in African-American history, including King; the novelist Alice Walker; Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children’s Defense Fund; and the filmmaker Spike Lee.

Spelman and Morehouse students also have deep emotional connections. A Spelman freshman often pairs up with a Morehouse freshman as “sister” and “brother” who are encouraged to support each other during their college careers. Many Spelman women have traditionally aspired to marry Morehouse men, and vice versa, matches that are regularly celebrated on Facebook, producing “SpelHouse” babies.

The students are also steeped in African-American history, and many Spelman women said they felt a responsibility to protect black men from negative stereotypes.

“Having your brother’s back or your sister’s back, that’s something that’s said,” said Euphoria Davis, a 21-year-old senior. “I’ve had someone tell me to my face that I’m tarnishing the reputation of Morehouse by speaking out.”

Ms. Davis said she was naïve and had never done more than kiss a man when she arrived from the Philadelphia suburbs in 2014. During her first semester, at a warehouse party off-campus, she said, a Morehouse student asked her to dance. When she declined, she said, he grabbed her and pulled her outside the building, assisted by other men.

She said she was too intoxicated to defend herself while the men pushed her against a wall and took turns raping her.

After struggling emotionally throughout the year, she found solace in telling her story to others and speaking out on behalf of sexual assault victims, she said. When she was contacted by Morehouse’s Title IX office, which handles sexual-misconduct complaints and had heard about her allegations, she declined to pursue a claim.

She was intimidated, she said, by a competitive campus culture where reputation is paramount. She and other students described a fierce social hierarchy that existed among the two schools — which have only about 2,000 students each — where one false step can cause a person to be ostracized.

“I’m not going to get the outcome that I want from this,” she recalled thinking. “So I’m not going to go through the stress of having my whole life exposed to have them just walk away.”

Another senior, Evalyne Neely-Savitt, said that when she arrived for her freshman year, she was hoping to become part of another mythic Spelman-Morehouse power couple.

Instead of her idealized vision, one of her first encounters with Morehouse men was at a fraternity party where one threw her over his shoulder, placed his head between her legs and simulated oral sex while squeezing her thighs and bottom.

The crowd cheered and afterward, people around her congratulated her for capturing the student’s attention. So she felt she would not be supported for speaking out out against what she considered an assault.

“I feel like I wouldn’t have been heard,” she said.

Students also described practical barriers to adjudicating sexual assault. The porous boundaries that allow students to mill back and forth between the two campuses to study and socialize are not mirrored in the way that the schools are governed. Numerous Spelman women said that because complaints against Morehouse men were investigated by Morehouse, they did not expect fair treatment.

In an email, a Spelman spokeswoman, Joyce E. Davis, said the college had expanded its Title IX office in the last two years and reached out to women to encourage them to report complaints. “Spelman takes every reported incident extremely seriously,” she said.

She added, however, that the college is “not permitted to sanction students from other educational institutions.”

At Morehouse, reaction to the campaign was mixed. Isaiah Smalls, the editor of The Maroon Tiger, the campus newspaper, said he planned an entire issue on sexual assault. “I believe that as a campus, we’re not as educated as we should be,” he said.

But an angry backlash emerged from some on the campus, who called the public accusations reckless and said that at least some were untrue.

“I was devastated,” said one of the students named on Twitter. “I felt the energy that I had gained up to that point being drained out of me.”

The student, who asked that his name not be published, said he had sex with a Spelman student during his first semester after receiving her consent. She later accused him of assault.

The allegations triggered a yearlong investigation, which, according to a Morehouse document, was ultimately decided in his favor. But by the time it was resolved, the student said, his grades had dropped, he had struggled to sleep because of anxiety, and he lost some scholarship money after being temporarily barred from playing sports.

In his speech, Mr. Martin, the Morehouse interim president, said that anyone who committed sexual violence or harassment would be held accountable. He also cautioned against “jumping to judgment” about students who were accused.

He ended with an admonition. “It’s also going to be the last time that anybody defaces the chapel on our campus,” he said. “But we will do the work on this important issue. Is that clear?”

That day, maintenance workers removed the spray paint from the chapel. Its faint outlines, however, remain.",Two Colleges Bound by History Are Roiled by the #MeToo Moment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/colleges-sexual-harassment.html

Comey, to drop the bureau’s criminal investigation of Mr. Flynn, and fired Mr. Comey after he failed to comply.
After Mr. Trump named him as his national security adviser in November, Mr. Flynn began briefing him — some say daily — on foreign policy.
In his phone call with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Flynn asked that Russia “not escalate the situation,” according to court documents released on Friday.
A phone call that included Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn, Ms. McFarland, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon was scheduled for 5 p.m., shortly after Ms. McFarland’s email exchange.
Mr. Cobb said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak in the call.","But it is evident from the emails — which were obtained from someone who had access to transition team communications — that after learning that President Barack Obama would expel 35 Russian diplomats, the Trump team quickly strategized about how to reassure Russia. The Trump advisers feared that a cycle of retaliation between the United States and Russia would keep the spotlight on Moscow’s election meddling, tarnishing Mr. Trump’s victory and potentially hobbling his presidency from the start.

As part of the outreach, Ms. McFarland wrote, Mr. Flynn would be speaking with the Russian ambassador, Mr. Kislyak, hours after Mr. Obama’s sanctions were announced.

“Key will be Russia’s response over the next few days,” Ms. McFarland wrote in an email to another transition official, Thomas P. Bossert, now the president’s homeland security adviser.

In an interview, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the Russia inquiry, said there was nothing illegal or unethical about the transition team’s actions. “It would have been political malpractice not to discuss sanctions,” he said, adding that “the presidential transition guide specifically encourages contact with and outreach to foreign dignitaries.”

The only problem, Mr. Cobb said, was that Mr. Flynn had lied to White House officials and to F.B.I. agents about what he had told the Russian ambassador. Mr. Flynn’s misstatements led to his firing in February and his guilty plea on Friday to charges of lying to federal agents.

With Mr. Flynn’s plea and agreement to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Russian election interference, the inquiry edges closer to Mr. Trump. The president tried to persuade the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to drop the bureau’s criminal investigation of Mr. Flynn, and fired Mr. Comey after he failed to comply.

Mr. Trump and his aides have suggested that his concern about Mr. Flynn’s potential legal jeopardy was motivated mainly by the president’s admiration for his former national security adviser’s military service and character.

But the new details about Mr. Flynn’s Russia contacts underscore the possibility that the president may have been worried not just about Mr. Flynn but also about whether any investigation might reach into the White House and perhaps to the Oval Office. That question will be at the center of any consideration by Mr. Mueller of whether Mr. Trump’s actions constituted obstruction of justice.

The Trump transition team ignored a pointed request from the Obama administration to avoid sending conflicting signals to foreign officials before the inauguration and to include State Department personnel when contacting them. Besides the Russian ambassador, Mr. Flynn, at the request of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, contacted several other foreign officials to urge them to delay or block a United Nations resolution condemning Israel over its building of settlements.

Mr. Cobb said the Trump team had never agreed to avoid such interactions. But one former White House official has disputed that, telling Mr. Mueller’s investigators that Trump transition officials had agreed to honor the Obama administration’s request.

Mr. Bossert forwarded Ms. McFarland’s Dec. 29 email exchange about the sanctions to six other Trump advisers, including Mr. Flynn; Reince Priebus, who had been named as chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the senior strategist; and Sean Spicer, who would become the press secretary.

Mr. Obama, she wrote, was trying to “box Trump in diplomatically with Russia,” which could limit his options with other countries, including Iran and Syria. “Russia is key that unlocks door,” she wrote.

She also wrote that the sanctions over Russian election meddling were intended to “lure Trump in trap of saying something” in defense of Russia, and were aimed at “discrediting Trump’s victory by saying it was due to Russian interference.”

“If there is a tit-for-tat escalation Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia, which has just thrown U.S.A. election to him,” she wrote.

Mr. Bossert replied by urging all the top advisers to “defend election legitimacy now.”

Mr. Flynn, who had been fired by Mr. Obama as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was the point person for the transition team on policy toward Russia and other countries. After Mr. Trump named him as his national security adviser in November, Mr. Flynn began briefing him — some say daily — on foreign policy.

Ms. McFarland, who served until May as deputy national security adviser and is awaiting confirmation as ambassador to Singapore, was sometimes referred to by other transition officials as “Flynn’s brain.” She could not be reached for comment.

Mr. Flynn’s Dec. 29 call with Mr. Kislyak was one of the first formal interactions between the incoming administration and a foreign government. On that winter day, Mr. Trump’s closest associates were scattered around several warm-weather locations.

Mr. Flynn was in the Dominican Republic. Other senior members of Mr. Trump’s transition team, including Ms. McFarland, were at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Kushner was vacationing in Hawaii with his family.

Obama administration officials were expecting a “bellicose” response to the expulsions and sanctions, according to the email exchange between Ms. McFarland and Mr. Bossert. Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser, had told Mr. Bossert that “the Russians have already responded with strong threats, promising to retaliate,” according to the emails.

In his phone call with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Flynn asked that Russia “not escalate the situation,” according to court documents released on Friday. He later related the substance of the call — including the discussion of sanctions — to a senior transition official, believed to be Ms. McFarland. A few days later, he briefed others on the transition team.

Mr. Flynn’s intervention appeared to have a dramatic effect. To the surprise of foreign policy experts, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not immediately respond with retaliatory expulsions of Americans from Moscow.

Mr. Trump praised that decision in a tweet, writing: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart.”

It is uncertain how involved Mr. Trump was in the discussions among his staff members of Mr. Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador. Mr. Spicer told reporters on the morning of Dec. 29 that the president-elect would be meeting with his national security team, including Ms. McFarland, that day. A phone call that included Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn, Ms. McFarland, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon was scheduled for 5 p.m., shortly after Ms. McFarland’s email exchange. It is unclear whether the call took place.

Mr. Cobb said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak in the call. After the inauguration, “Flynn specifically denied it to him, in the presence of witnesses,” he said.

Some legal experts have speculated that the contacts during the transition between Trump aides and foreign officials might violate the Logan Act, a law that prohibits private American citizens from working with a foreign government against the United States. But the act has not been used to prosecute anyone since the 19th century. Mr. Cobb said the law “certainly does not apply” to a presidential transition team.

The day after the president fired Mr. Flynn, he talked about the F.B.I. inquiry with Mr. Comey, the agency’s director. Mr. Comey has said the president urged him to drop the inquiry. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump said, according to a memo that Mr. Comey wrote immediately afterward. The White House has denied that account. The president fired Mr. Comey in May.

Testifying before Congress in June, Mr. Comey declined to say whether the president had fired him to impede the investigation. “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct,” he said. “I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that’s an offense.”",Emails Dispute White House Claims That Flynn Acted Independently on Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/russia-mcfarland-flynn-trump-emails.html

Even a less sweeping, less threatening scandal can have a chilling effect on a White House.
Either tack would almost surely provoke a bipartisan firestorm and, critics warned, potentially expose Mr. Trump to impeachment proceedings for obstruction of justice.
Lawmakers were quick to warn Mr. Trump away from such a course in the hours after Mr. Flynn’s plea.
Given that, many analysts expect Mr. Trump to continue his practice of instigating polarizing debates over divisive issues, like slamming kneeling National Football League players or distributing anti-Muslim videos.","Within a couple of hours, he went to Twitter for a more forceful response. “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

And by evening, he was trying to shift attention back to Hillary Clinton. “Many people in our Country are asking what the ‘Justice’ Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and ‘acid washed’ 33,000 Emails?” he wrote, referring to email messages that Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers deemed unrelated to her government work. “No justice!”

The special counsel investigation into Russia’s interference in last year’s election has driven him to fits of anger for months, and his staff could hardly be surprised that he would vent that again. From their point of view, his first comments on Saturday at least were not aimed at investigators.

“The Flynn plea is important, too, because it shows that the cracks in the White House front that everyone suspected are real,” said David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. “And they may widen. It seems likely to deepen the sense of siege in the West Wing. That siege mentality can be crippling.”

History offers mixed lessons. Watergate obviously destroyed Richard M. Nixon’s presidency and even that of his successor, Gerald R. Ford, who was punished by voters for pardoning him. President Bill Clinton survived being impeached for lying under oath about sexual liaisons with Monica S. Lewinsky only after a Senate trial in which lawmakers opted against removing him from office.

Even a less sweeping, less threatening scandal can have a chilling effect on a White House. When Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, was indicted on a charge of lying to investigators about the leak of a C.I.A. officer’s identity, West Wing colleagues were demoralized. One later called it “the lowest point” of his White House tenure. And it led to deep tension between Mr. Cheney and President George W. Bush over whether Mr. Libby should be pardoned.

The key for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton was convincing the public that they were not distracted by the investigations but instead remained focused on doing their jobs and serving the American people. In Mr. Clinton’s case, at least, it was partially an act — while he was able to effectively manage major foreign policy issues even at the height of the impeachment debate, in private he was consumed by the investigation, raged endlessly about his tormentors and at times seemed deeply distracted.

Aides found Mr. Clinton absently playing with old campaign buttons, and at a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, it fell to an adviser to conduct the discussion while the president’s mind drifted off. On another occasion, the head of the World Bank called a top White House official after a meeting with Mr. Clinton to say, “It’s like he isn’t there.” During a visit to the Middle East, an aide noticed Mr. Clinton trying to keep his mind from wandering off by scribbling on a yellow legal pad, “Focus on your job, focus on your job, focus on your job.”

Mr. Trump is hardly a model of political discipline, and keeping him focused has been a major preoccupation of his staff from the beginning. Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer overseeing the response to the investigation, has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to keep quiet about it, with mixed results. John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general serving as White House chief of staff, tries to keep Mr. Trump’s day filled with meetings on policy issues but has yet to tame the president’s Twitter habit.

“To be sure, an event like this can be a drain on morale, especially for those who worked with and like General Flynn,” said Shannen W. Coffin, a former counsel to Mr. Cheney. “For the rest of the White House, it’s important not to get dragged down into the Washington speculation game, and that they keep their eyes on the ball on the president’s priorities in domestic policy, judicial appointments, national security and the like.”

Mr. Coffin pointed to Mr. Kelly, who has enforced more order on the West Wing operation, if not on the president himself. “With some internal discipline, which the chief of staff has imposed, there’s no reason this should become all consuming,” he said.

Mr. Trump has options for short-circuiting the investigation that other presidents might not have contemplated in similar circumstances. Having already fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, Mr. Trump could likewise fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, or he could pardon Mr. Flynn or others swept up in the investigation. Either tack would almost surely provoke a bipartisan firestorm and, critics warned, potentially expose Mr. Trump to impeachment proceedings for obstruction of justice.

Lawmakers were quick to warn Mr. Trump away from such a course in the hours after Mr. Flynn’s plea. “I think any pardons or any type of shenanigans with this whole process would be very troublesome,” said Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, one of the Democrats considered friendliest with Mr. Trump.

Assuming the Senate and House reconcile their different versions of the tax cuts and send a final bill to the president for his signature, it will provide a burst of momentum near the end of an otherwise rocky first year for Mr. Trump. What remains unclear is whether he can keep that going. Mr. Trump and lawmakers have just days to agree on spending legislation to avert a partial government shutdown, and even if they fulfill that most basic of governmental responsibilities, there are no easy areas of agreement looming next.

The tax cuts presumably will keep the current economic surge going in the short term as markets hit records and Mr. Trump has effectively used his executive power to slash regulations to the delight of the corporate world. But on immigration, infrastructure, health care and other issues, no ready consensus exists even among Republicans, much less across the aisle, for major legislation.

Given that, many analysts expect Mr. Trump to continue his practice of instigating polarizing debates over divisive issues, like slamming kneeling National Football League players or distributing anti-Muslim videos. His advisers harbor little hope of expanding his popular support in the short term and appear mainly intent on holding his base of 35 to 40 percent of the public.

“To move forward, they are just going to have to hunker down with the lawyers and rally the base,” Mr. Greenberg said. “Unless or until this gets still worse.”","Wrenched From Scandal to Success, Trump Looks Ahead, and Over His Shoulder",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/trump-flynn-senate-vote-taxes.html

Alternatively, it would set up a rubber match between Alabama and Clemson, which have played each other in the past two national championship games, with each winning one.

Certainly Clemson, the defending champion and winner of the past three Atlantic Coast Conference titles, appears strong. The Tigers seemed to hardly miss quarterback Deshaun Watson, the two-time Heisman Trophy finalist who now plays for the Houston Texans; its sole loss, at Syracuse, came with quarterback Kelly Bryant out for part of the game with an injury. On Saturday, Clemson routed Miami (10-2), which entered the Atlantic Coast Conference title game ranked seventh, 38-3. Clemson also boasts wins over Auburn and two other ranked teams.

With decisive wins on Saturday in their conference championship games, Oklahoma and Georgia also positioned themselves for playoff spots.

Georgia, ranked No. 6 by the selection committee entering the weekend, redeemed a loss at Auburn last month when Georgia had been the top-ranked team in the country. That leaves Georgia with a 12-1 record, including wins over Auburn, ranked No. 2 going into the game, as well as over No. 15 Notre Dame (9-3) and No. 23 Mississippi State (8-4).

It was Georgia’s first SEC championship since 2005 and first under its second-year coach, Kirby Smart. Though a perennial contender, Georgia had not played for the national title in the three years of the playoff nor the 16 of the Bowl Championship Series, and was last the No. 1-ranked team in the country at season’s end after the 1980 season.

No. 3 Oklahoma (12-1) has twice beaten a solid Texas Christian team (10-3) — the second time on Saturday, for the Big 12 title, when T.C.U. was ranked 11th — and this season has also defeated Ohio State (10-2) and No. 19 Oklahoma State (9-3). Oklahoma’s sole loss came to Iowa State (7-5) by 7 points.

While Oklahoma’s win most obviously wiped out T.C.U.’s chance at the playoff, for practical purposes it also pushed out No. 10 Southern California (11-2), despite the Trojans’ triumph over No. 12 Stanford (9-4) in the Pacific-12 championship game Friday night. U.S.C.’s 31-28 win was no blowout, and ahead of it in the rankings entering Saturday were all six teams in the major-conference title games still to be played, plus No. 5 Alabama (11-1). The Trojans are almost certainly headed to the Fiesta Bowl on Dec. 30 in Glendale, Ariz.

Oklahoma’s victory accomplished one other thing: It cemented further — not that it needed it — the front-runner status of its senior quarterback, Baker Mayfield, for the Heisman Trophy. Mayfield, a previous finalist, had stood out in a field otherwise occupied by running backs who did not quite break out. He entered Saturday with the Football Bowl Subdivision’s highest completion percentage and yards per attempt and a blistering touchdown-to-interception ratio of 37 to 5. On Saturday, against T.C.U.’s eighth-ranked scoring defense, he threw for four touchdowns and 243 yards.

Oklahoma (and Mayfield) have now won the Big 12 for three consecutive years.

A.C.C. Championship: Clemson 38, Miami 3

No. 1 Clemson emphatically claimed its spot in the College Football Playoff with a big victory over No. 7 Miami in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game Saturday night.

The Tigers (12-1) came in ranked atop the playoff standings and should remain that way following the selection Sunday. Their decisive show left little doubt the defending national champs are looking to go back-to-back.

Kelly Bryant set a championship game record by completing his first 15 passes — surpassing the 13 straight completions of his friend and former teammate Deshaun Watson — and finished with 252 yards passing and a 27-yard touchdown pass to Deon Cain.

The win was Clemson’s third straight ACC crown.

Clemson’s Travis Etienne opened the scoring with a 4-yard touchdown before Bryant’s twisting, 11-yard run for a 14-0 first-quarter lead. It was essentially over after that as the Hurricanes (10-2) have lost two straight.

Miami fell apart in the third quarter with a pair of interceptions by Malik Rosier, leading to 10 points for the Tigers. The Hurricanes, who had averaged 440 yards a game this season, finished with 214 yards. (AP)

Big Ten Championship: Ohio State 27, Wisconsin 21

J.T. Barrett looked just fine Saturday. Now it is up to college football’s selection committee to decide whether No. 8 Ohio State has done enough to earn a playoff bid.

Six days after having surgery on his right knee, Barrett threw two touchdown passes, ran for another and had a crucial fourth-down conversion late in the game to give the Buckeyes a victory over previously unbeaten No. 3 Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game.

Ohio State (11-2) claimed its first conference crown since its 2014 national championship season. The loss ended the nation’s longest active winning streak at 13 and probably doomed the playoff hopes of the Badgers (12-1).

The reason: Barrett’s incredibly speedy recovery.

While most athletes need at least two or three weeks to recover from minor knee surgery, Barrett told doctors and coaches he would be OK. And after watching Barrett in pregame warm-ups with a protective brace around the injured knee, Barrett got the starting nod and played like the three-time conference quarterback of the year.

After running nine yards to convert a third down on the Buckeyes’ second possession of the game, he found a wide open Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard TD pass to make it 7-0.

Two possessions later, Barrett’s threw a short pass to Parris Campbell, who turned a missed tackle into a 57-yard mistake for another score. Then after a 77-yard run by J.K. Dobbins, Barrett powered in from the 1-yard line to give the Buckeyes a 21-7 lead early in the second quarter.

Barrett made some mistakes and missed some receivers.

But the only time he really paid for it came on an ill-advised pass from near his goal line in the first quarter. Barrett was picked off by Andrew Van Ginkel, who returned it nine yards for a Wisconsin score.

Otherwise, the Buckeyes were pretty much in control.

Barrett finished 12 of 26 with 211 yards, two touchdowns, two interceptions and rushed 19 times for 60 yards. (AP)

SEC Championship: Georgia 28, Auburn 7

Shaking off a blowout loss to Auburn just three weeks ago, Jake Fromm threw two touchdown passes and No. 6 Georgia made its bid for a spot in the football playoff by beating the No. 4 Tigers in the Southeastern Conference championship game.

Auburn (10-3) was the hottest team in the country, rolling into Atlanta after wins over Georgia and then-No. 1 Alabama in its last three games. But the Tigers were stymied by two crucial turnovers, a blocked field goal and a Georgia team eager to make up for its embarrassing 40-17 defeat on the Plains.

Nick Chubb, Sony Michel and the freshman D’Andre Swift provided a much more effective running game for Georgia than the first meeting, which opened up things for the freshman quarterback. Fromm completed 16 of 22 passes for 183 yards, including a 2-yard touchdown to Isaac Nauta in the second quarter and a 6-yarder to Terry Godwin with just over 13 minutes remaining that essentially sealed Georgia’s victory.

The Bulldogs claimed their first SEC title since 2005 and capped an impressive rise in Kirby Smart’s second season as coach. Georgia went 8-5 a year ago, but Nick Saban’s former defensive coordinator insisted he was establishing a culture that would return the team to national prominence.

It happened in Year 2.

Georgia (12-1), which was No. 6 in the latest College Football Playoff standings, will surely move into the top four after its dominating performance against the Tigers. Auburn was ranked second in that poll but managed only 259 yards after piling up 488 in the Nov. 11 rout. (AP)

Big 12 Championship: Oklahoma 41, T.C.U. 17

Baker Mayfield threw for four touchdowns as No. 2 Oklahoma staked its claim for the College Football Playoff in Arlington, Tex., in the return of the Big 12 championship game.

With their record 11th Big 12 title, the Sooners (12-1), who are ranked third for the playoff, are a lock to play in it for the second time in three seasons. They are the only Big 12 team to make the four-team playoff format, which started in 2014.

Oklahoma jumped out to a quick 17-0 lead with the help of Caleb Kelly’s 18-yard fumble return for a touchdown after running back Kyle Hicks’s turnover on the first offensive play by Texas Christian (10-3).

Kenny Hill threw two touchdown passes to get the Horned Frogs to 24-17 at halftime, but Oklahoma scored twice on its first three offensive plays after the break.

Mayfield, the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy, which will be named next week, finished 15 for 23 passing for 243 yards and was the game’s most valuable player. The first two touchdowns were to tight end Mark Andrews.

Hill opened the second half with three consecutive incompletions. On the first play after the punt, Mayfield hit Mykel Jones for a 55-yard catch-and-run score.

On fourth-and-1 from the Oklahoma 41 on the next drive, Hill bootlegged to the right side. Defensive end Ogbonnia Okoronkwo chased him toward the sideline before Parnell Motley delivered the crushing blow that kept T.C.U.’s quarterback from getting a first down.

“It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience — these are our core principles,” the ABC statement said. “We fell far short of that yesterday.”

Kathleen Culver, the director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the mistake would give fresh ammunition to Mr. Trump and other conservatives who have attacked the credibility of news organizations, especially those that have reported negatively on the administration.

“This error plays right into the hands of people who callously try to say that news media all just lie,” Ms. Culver said in an interview on Saturday night. “This is the kind of thing you can see being brought up again and again and again at appearances by the president, where he will take one situation in which something was wrong, and blow that out into a condemnation that all news media are fake.”

Hours after ABC’s statement, Mr. Trump used Twitter to praise the network for suspending Mr. Ross, calling his report “horrendously inaccurate and dishonest.” The president ended his tweet by referring to “Fake News.”

Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter that the error was the latest in a series of high-profile mistakes by Mr. Ross.

“I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong,” Mr. Fleischer wrote, in reference to a 2001 report in which he said Mr. Ross inaccurately linked Iraq and its dictator Saddam Hussein to an anthrax attack on the United States. “Brian Ross went with it anyway.”

In 2012, Mr. Ross and ABC issued an apology after Mr. Ross incorrectly suggested that the shooter in the massacre at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater was involved with a Tea Party organization.

While Ms. Culver said the network’s decision to suspend Mr. Ross was an appropriate first step, she said the mistake should also prompt a wider assessment by ABC of his record, as well as a more general evaluation across the media industry of the push for speed, which likely contributed to the error.

“We are at a time when public trust in news media is so low that we have to work constantly to try to rebuild that trust,” she said. “And every time practices go awry like this, we do damage to that trust.

Mr. Trump was notoriously accused of multiple acts of sexual harassment and assault, and was caught on tape bragging about his proclivity for grabbing women. That several of the men covering the race — shaping the way American voters understood the candidates and what was at stake — were apparently behaving in similarly appalling ways off-camera calls into question not just their objectivity but also their ability to cover the story with the seriousness and urgency it demanded.

Sexual harassment at the hands of political journalists also pulls back the curtain on how too many of these men view women generally. The journalists in question are accused of a range of behaviors, some more serious than others, from drunken unsolicited kisses to, in Mr. Lauer’s case, sexual assault (in addition to exposing himself to a colleague and sending another a sex toy with a note detailing how he would like to use it on her). The theme running through nearly all of the complaints is a man in a position of power who saw the women around him not as competent colleagues or as even sovereign human beings, but as sexual objects he could either proposition to boost his ego or humiliate to feed a desire for domination.

It’s hard to look at these men’s coverage of Mrs. Clinton and not see glimmers of that same simmering disrespect and impulse to keep women in a subordinate place. When men turn some women into sexual objects, the women who are inside that box are one-dimensional, while those outside of it become disposable; the ones who refuse to be disposed of, who continue to insist on being seen and heard, are inconvenient and pitiable at best, deceitful shrews and crazy harpies at worst. That’s exactly how some commentary and news coverage treated Mrs. Clinton.

This has ripple effects for all women. Men are assumed to fail or succeed based on merit; they are mentored and supported by more senior men, and no one bats an eye. Young women, though, are often treated as suspect if more senior men take an interest in them (and too often, more senior men’s interests are suspect indeed, but it’s women’s reputations that suffer the stigma of being thought to sleep or flirt their way to the top rather than earning their perches).

When men see women as sex objects first and colleagues second, their actual talents, skills and smarts are easily overlooked. A boss who harasses the woman in the cubicle next to you may not be sexually coercing you or torpedoing your career, but his actions signal that he does not see women as competent co-workers entitled to a rewarding and effective workplace.

Some commentators, most notably Geraldo Rivera, have written some acts of harassment off as courtship gone awry. This is truly bizarre, and it illustrates just how tied we are to the idea that women are inherently inviting sexual aggression and that men are inherently sexually voracious and socially clueless. Women, and most men, know that courtship doesn’t typically take the form of unwanted grabbing or unsolicited indecent exposure. (“Mommy and Daddy fell in love the day Daddy called Mommy into his office and began vigorously masturbating at her” is not exactly a meet-cute story.)

This moment isn’t about a nation of confused men. It’s about a minority of men who choose to treat women alternately as walking sex objects or bothersome and potentially devious nags. It’s about a majority of Americans who give men a pass for all manner of bad behavior, because they assume men are entitled to behave badly but hold women to an entirely different standard.

That is why it’s so egregious that sexual harassers set the tone of much of the coverage of the woman who hoped to be the first female president.

These “Crooked Hillary” narratives pushed by Mr. Lauer, Mr. Halperin, and a long list of other prominent journalists and pundits indelibly shaped the election, and were themselves gendered: Hillary Clinton as a cackling witch, Hillary Clinton a woman it was easy to distrust because she was also a woman seeking power, and what kind of woman does that? Mr. Trump emphasized this caricature as part of his more broadly sexist campaign, but he didn’t invent it. Nor was he the only famous man going on television to perpetuate it — while revealing a deep disdain for women when the cameras weren’t rolling.

The four men awaiting sentencing on Monday — Kenny Kwan, Charles Lai, Raymond Lam and Sheldon Wong — pleaded guilty in May to charges including voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension.

The four of them — as well as another student, Daniel Li — had initially been charged with third-degree murder, which does not involve premeditation or a specific intent to kill, but their charges were reduced after an agreement with prosecutors. Mr. Li reached a separate agreement to reduce his charges after he cooperated with prosecutors.

Legal experts have cited the case as an example of prosecutors taking a harder line in pursuing criminal charges after college students are killed while being hazed. In another Pennsylvania case, at least two dozen people have been charged after a 19-year-old Penn State University student, Timothy Piazza, died in February after a “pledge night” of drunken partying.

However, it can be rewarding if you want higher-quality pictures, more control over how your images look and to learn more about the technical aspects of photography. But you should plan time to educate yourself on how the camera works and be prepared to spend at least a few hundred dollars on equipment, including for the camera body and interchangeable lenses.

No matter she was 15 years older. In addition to our devotion to our Alabama family, we shared our love of the water, the arts and the pulsing energy of New York City as our adopted home. We clearly shared DNA, Sherrell’s lush, wavy black hair going prematurely to silver, prefiguring my thick, curly black hair soon going that way.

And we loved to talk, chatting about our spouses and children, our work and vacations, my literary projects and the goings-on, behind the scenes, of “All My Children,” the popular soap opera she directed. As she trimmed me up, the leavings falling to the floor — it was my job to sweep them into a dust pan — I realized she moved in a world of glamorous hair, actresses paying handsomely for just the right coif. But Sherrell went natural, always.

As I hold up a mirror to see how she’s progressing, I see her own silver hair cascading to her shoulders, her eyes dark and empathetic, her presence strong and nurturing.

“Well, how’s it look?” she asks, removing the towel and shaking it out.

“Pretty good. Actually, just right.”

She smiles, a big sister happy to oblige.

I set down the mirror, then hold it up again.

She’s not there.

———

Touch can bring people back to us — my father giving me a bear hug, my mother rubbing her hand over my whiskery cheek, my grandfather bouncing me as a 2-year-old on his belly. For all the epic impact of loved ones on our lives, sometimes gestures as simple as a home haircut make them feel present again.

I’d know my sister in a half-second by the pressure of her hand on my scalp, turning me just a little, situating me to edge the hair off my collar. When not in the TV studio she was often with horses, riding as well as teaching students with special needs how to saddle up and guide a gentle mare around a ring. She had the gentle but firm, no-nonsense way of a woman used to brushing down big animals, currying manes.

She would have tended to our dad’s hair, too, I’m sure, neatening his corona of gray around the back of his bald pate — my hair came from our mom’s side of the family — but he was old-school, the barber shop his convivial, bi-weekly destination.

I started out in that tradition. As a kid in Mobile I’d ride my bike a half-dozen blocks to where Mr. Snow, in a window behind the red-and-white pole out front, groomed us boys in pompadours made slick with Vitalis. For those of us who “acted up,” he threatened to show us “a jar of ears” in the back. We sat stock still in his barber’s chair.

As a teen, in military school, I found whomever I could to keep me shorn. By then, in a divide between mop heads on the left and crew cuts on the right, the tonsorial had become cultural. In 1968, on a high school trip to visit Sherrell in New York, she guided me to the new Broadway musical “Hair.” I felt freedom in the lyrics: “Flow it / show it / Long as God can grow it / My hair.” Maybe my sister was grooming me politically, too.

Sherrell took over my barber duties not long after I turned 18 and I was at liberty to let it grow. I’d relax on her kitchen stool as she kept me from looking scraggly while I’d reflect on college, later my first job, and soon marriage. As she’d tidy me up I’d relish her stories about moving to New York in 1960 as a “career girl” instead of marrying young down South, her forays into the fledgling world of television, and her career path in a male domain, behind the camera, from variety and talk shows to daytime drama. “You were a feminist,” I’d say, looking at her in a photo with two dozen other crew members of “The David Frost Show,” from 1970. She was easy to spot, not only for her raven hair already brushed silver. She was the only woman on the production team. “I just wanted,” she responded, “to make my own way.”

Her progressive spirit moved me, and the way she last saw me — a child of the 1960s heading toward his 60s, gray curls spilling from under a sun visor — was a portrait she’d helped create. Hair was no longer as defining politically, but it still spoke to the tribe we identify with, be it aging white men with the grad school look, free spirits, no matter thinning and receding, unbowed by time. She embraced that.

When she lost her own gorgeous hair during cancer treatment she spoke of it little, insisting on turning the attention to everyone else. She kept right on tending us all, a big sister watching out for the young ones, no matter our age. When her locks grew back we were joyous. They symbolized far more.

There was recurrence. She was 70 when we lost her.

I didn’t want anybody else, ever, to touch my hair again.

———

Not long ago Sherrell was given a posthumous alumni award at her high school in Mobile, and I received the honor on her behalf. I spoke of her love of family and home, her television career, her blazing and tender spirit. A group of her girlfriends at the event, now grandmothers, reminisced to me how they’d eat lunch beneath the big oaks on campus, sharing secrets, dreams.

Afterward I walked beneath those oaks toward the parking lot, seeing Sherrell and friends in the flush of youth, bangs and ponytails shining, visiting in the dappled shade. Back in my car I glanced in the rearview mirror and caught an image of myself, soaked through with Deep South humidity. My hair looked wild.

“Time for a trim,” I heard her say.

“His airplane was the one place he felt young and not impaired at all,” his son Mitchell said.

His father was the only person aboard the plane when it crashed, having taken off that morning from Pittsfield, Mass. He lived nearby in Windsor, in the Berkshires. The cause of the crash was under investigation.

“Amid our shock and grief we realize he went out on top doing what he wants,” Mitchell Baker said in a telephone interview.

Mr. Baker’s most audacious adventure was a nautical one: his breathtaking trans-Atlantic sail with Heyerdahl in 1970 from Morocco to Barbados.

They sought to demonstrate a hypothesis: that the pyramids, hieroglyphs and sophisticated calendars developed by pre-Columbian civilizations in Mexico, Central America and Peru might have been inspired by Egyptians who, deliberately or after being blown off course, drifted and sailed with the Canary Current to the Western Hemisphere as long as 5,000 years ago.

The 1970 voyage was actually a second attempt. A year earlier, Heyerdahl, Mr. Baker and their crew had embarked from Morocco on a raft named Ra, for the ancient Egyptian sun god. But the bundled reeds that kept the craft afloat became waterlogged. The voyagers had to be rescued hundreds of miles short of their goal.

In May 1970, the Heyerdahl crew set sail for Barbados again, this time on Ra II, a frail 40-foot-long vessel fashioned from papyrus reeds with a wicker cabin amidships, an upturned prow and stern, an A-shaped mast and a square sail punctuated by a blood-red circle.

The crew was equipped with modern navigational devices, a hand-cranked radio and a charcoal brazier and gas stove. They complied with the law by leaving with an inflatable life raft.

Otherwise they replicated the seafaring of ancient mariners during a 57-day crossing, braving powerful gales and 30-foot crests.

“Wind is very strong indeed, but the terrible mountainous seas are all out of proportion to the wind,” Heyerdahl wrote.

Mr. Baker once described their makeshift boat as a “writhing creature, sounding more like a berserk warthog stumbling around in a thicket than a ship at sea.”

What the latter-day explorers discovered was pollution.

“For weeks at a time there was no sign of man,” Mr. Baker told The Boston Globe after returning to his family, then living in New Rochelle, N.Y. “Just his garbage.”

The Ra II flew under the United Nations flag and carried a multinational crew; in addition to Mr. Baker, the celestial navigator and radio operator, it included an Egyptian diver, a Soviet doctor, an Italian mountain climber and a carpenter from Chad.

“We knew that no space was too narrow and no stress too great for modern men to take a joint lift for common survival, regardless of national, racial, political and religious barriers,” Heyerdahl wrote.

He immortalized the voyages in a book and a documentary film, both titled “The Ra Expeditions” (1971), and in another book, “Thor Heyerdahl and the Reed Boat Ra” (1974), by Barbara Beasley Murphy and Mr. Baker. The film was nominated for an Oscar.

More than two decades earlier, in 1947, Heyerdahl had sailed across the Pacific from South America to the Polynesian islands in a raft named Kon-Tiki, for the Inca sun god. That expedition became the subject of a book by Heyerdahl and an Academy Award-winning documentary, “Kon Tiki” (1950), which he directed.

In 1978, Mr. Baker joined Heyerdahl on another reed boat, the Tigris, which they sailed through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea to validate their theory that there had been migration and trade links between ancient Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, now the site of Pakistan and Western India.

Norman Leonard Baker was born on Nov. 18, 1928, in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.

His mother was the former Sally Feiden. His father, Edward, was an executive secretary for the White Star cruise ship line. After the company laid him off, he moved the family to a farm in Connecticut for a time. In the mid-1930s, in the midst of the Depression, he and his brother joined the Expert Concrete Company, started by Norman’s grandfather in Long Island City, Queens.

The company worked on the original World Trade Center and Trump Tower and pioneered the pumping of concrete from cement mixers to construction sites.

Norman graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, soloed as a pilot on his 17th birthday and earned a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from Cornell University.

His wife, the former Mary Ann Tischler, died in 2003. In addition to their son Mitchell, he is survived by another son, Daniel; a daughter, Elizabeth Atwood; and seven grandchildren. An older brother, Howard, died six years ago.

Mr. Baker worked as a miner and engineer in Alaska; staked out what was described as the last unsurveyed boundary between Colorado and New Mexico; served on a Navy destroyer during the Korean War; captained a yacht in the Pacific, where he met Heyerdahl, in Tahiti; and, after returning to New York, earned an engineering license at Cooper Union.

He and his family later spent three years in the British Virgin Islands rebuilding a 95-foot schooner, the Anne Kristine. In 1986, they sailed her into New York harbor for the Statue of Liberty centennial celebration after trying to circumnavigate the globe.

How, Mitchell Baker was asked, had his father evolved from a big-city boy with a bent for engineering into a swashbuckling adventurer? After reflecting for a moment, he recalled that Mr. Baker had been an avid reader, and not just of comic strips.

“I was stumped until I remembered planning his around-the-world trip,” Mitchell Baker said. “Each destination came with one of the stories he read as a child. I really think that’s how a boy from Brooklyn realized that there was a world outside New York, and he was desperate to find it.”","Norman Baker, Adventurer, Dies at 89; Crossed Atlantic on Reed Raft",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/obituaries/norman-baker-dies-at-89-crossed-the-atlantic-on-a-reed-raft.html

Dr. Kellner said it was also much more likely that pterosaurs laid their eggs in large nesting colonies near lake and river shores rather than in solitary nests high on cliffsides. He added that the large number of eggs they found suggested the pterosaurs returned to the nesting spot numerous times to lay their eggs.

More Reporting on Paleontology

Using CT-scanning, the team peered into the shells. Of the 215 eggs they found, 16 had embryonic remains, including one with partial wings and a toothless lower jaw. The team also discovered evidence that hatchlings had leg bones that were more developed than their forelimbs, suggesting the babies most likely crawled and were unable to fly. The team added that young pterosaurs were probably very reliant on their parents.

Denis Charles Deeming, a paleontologist from the University of Lincoln in England who wrote an adjoining article in Science about the findings, said he was surprised by the sheer number of eggs that were all collected together in one place. But he cautioned against making conclusions about the early lives and development of pterosaurs from the small number of embryos that the team found.

“They try to paint a picture of how these things worked, but the reality of it is that the evidence isn’t there,” he said.

The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost.","Whatever happens, age-old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html

Azu Nwagbogu, the festival’s founder and director, spoke with James Estrin about photography in Africa. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

What is your goal with the Lagos photo festival?

A.

I feel like photography has the power to make us understand the world better and to create empathy. So the goal is to have more visual storytellers telling more new stories to enable us to imagine a newer, better, richer, more prosperous, more safe, more empowered Africa.

In the past, the stories were told to create pity, and pity is an emotion that is not sustainable, that is easily dismissed, that does not allow us to understand or appreciate how to engage in that community. You just look away. And we are not trying to make people look away, we are trying to make people understand and invite them to share and to be part of that story.

Q.

How did you put together this year’s festival?

A.

The theme of the festival is Regimes of Truth. We are exploring a further understanding of the post-truth society that we live in. Now we are either inundated with so much information, or we have constructed another reality of what the truth is.

So it’s really looking at the way photography, the media and artists explore these notions of what is true and what is real. Because photography was founded on the science of observation, and it has always flattered itself to be a representative or an arbiter of truth.

In contemporary society, we now know that an image can be very deceptive and it can be propaganda. But at the same time we understand that visual language is becoming more decipherable by many more people, and that’s one of the reasons why I feel Africa is getting a lot of attention, mainly because of photography.

Photography created a pejorative view of the continent. Photography is also able to emancipate the impression that we have of Africa.

We have some really interesting work. Samuel Fosso’s “Black Pope” (Slide 7) explores the way religion and its symbols and objects that are used to create the narrative of a papal figure are so removed from the African context and culture that it almost promotes this idea of whiteness and white supremacy. In the history of the papacy, there has never been a black pope, while today the greatest number of Roman Catholics is actually in Africa.

Q.

In the 19th century, photography was thought to be scientifically accurate. Photojournalism still holds the conceit that one can be accurate in a sense. In a “post-truth” society, what does truth mean in relation to photography?

A.

I think through photography, especially photojournalism, we can sometimes establish the facts. When you have the facts, you can build on them and create the architecture that becomes the truth of the story.

Photojournalism is still very important in establishing the facts. How many people died, how many people traveled, who were the people in the room at that time. Photography can still do this. But to tell the story, you need to build a truth. But the truth is complex and the truth is something that we all search for. So I think that is always the balance between photography and visual culture.

Q.

How do you see the history of photography in Africa, and what is the role of photography in Africa today?

A.

It was photography that was used to create a dominant view for the colonizer over the Africans. And that is all about the colonizer with his hand over objects, or over his subjects. And it’s always about power, domination, control. So that’s really been the history of photography on the continent. It’s always been completely based on propaganda.

When we reflect on this in contemporary times, we want to reverse that.

We feel that sometimes we learn more through fiction than through what is considered to be factual. For example, the best information about Russia in the 19th century, when there was a lot of censorship, comes through fiction. So for us, it’s always finding that dance between the fictional and the factual. And also reclaiming African identity, which is really important to us.

We feel like we can’t use one approach. We have to adopt both. A lot of the fictive images seem to get more attention, but we have always had a strong documentary effort in the festivals.

Q.

Other than by exhibiting the stories, how do you build a culture and community of photographers to tell them? Or is that too elitist?

A.

No, I think that’s a mission of the festival. It’s always about building a community that has ownership, passion, and a feeling of adventure and camaraderie. We want to shape the way the stories that relate to Africa are told, and I think that’s really the most important thing that we can achieve. And that’s by shaping and expanding the community of visual storytellers.

One of the legacies of colonial intervention is a fragmentation of community. And where you have fragmentation of community it becomes harder to come together to grow.

We have conventional African storytellers trying to tell stories the way they think the West is interested in seeing the stories. There was not a community to support younger, contemporary visual storytellers on the continent who were trying to find their own voice, trying to find their own language, their own way, their own approach, their own unique, more knowledgeable perspective in telling stories that relate to Africa.

But when you have the community, there is a support for more nuanced, more honest, more true, more representative stories of contemporary Africa.

Q.

I see lot of work from Africa that is more in the art space and employs broader storytelling strategies. Is there a place in the Western media for African photographers? Or do they have to adjust or transform to fit that?

A.

I don’t think they need to transform. I keep hearing people say Africa seems to be in the news, to be hot, to be trending. I think it’s mainly because lots more people are able to tell their own stories and publish their own stories, by themselves, on social media. So that authorship, independent of the mainstream, has generated this interest in the unique voices and stories in Africa.

I don’t think there’s a real need to adapt or to change to a more understandable or decipherable visual language that the West is interested in. It’s more about developing an authentic voice and making sure that it’s consistent and coherent.

Q.

How?

A.

My message to practitioners on the continent is we shouldn’t follow Western journalism or art institutions, which are dominated by white males. Rather, we should innovate and find ways to be more representative, to include other voices. Media houses on the continent have to make sure they have as many women as men, and you have to make sure that you have women as editors. If you have enough diversity from the beginning, it makes it easier to make sure that you’re telling stories that are diverse, that are inclusive, that are more all embracing.

It’s really an exciting time on the continent — a lot is happening and a lot can still happen.

Q.

How about social class?

A.

Class is a massive problem in Africa, but the wonderful thing is that because of the communal nature of society, you’re never too far removed from those above and below you.

Class is always an issue in terms of breaking the mold and inviting more people to engage in the wider public discourse. That’s why contemporary art is so important. You come into an artist’s vision in public spaces where you have what I call interdependence — where people can agree or disagree, share ideas, in a very peaceful and a very safe zone with others of all classes. So there is really no need for conflict.

Q.

How are you bringing work to the public?

A.

We curate exhibitions in public spaces, like parks, where people can leave comments in any language about what they feel about the work. The most interesting comments we get are from people who might not feel comfortable in museums or galleries but feel very comfortable in parks.

Q.

How did you get involved in photography?

A.

Fifteen years ago when I was a writer and a scientist I realized that photography was the most powerful tool for visual storytelling, engagement and emancipation. And once I got into it I never looked back.

Q.

Were you ever a photographer?

A.

Not at all. I was more of a writer and curator. Those were my interests, my passion, so curating and writing is what I did.

Q.

The festival doesn’t only feature photographers who were born in Africa.

A.

Absolutely not. I think it’s really stupid that people sometimes question that. A lot of the work that exists on the continent has been made by photographers from elsewhere.

Sometimes the work is really, really good and meaningful and nuanced and well done, so why shouldn’t we show that? It’s empowering, and also it’s important that the local photographers see themselves as equals with anyone else. So that’s really the strength of the festival, is the fact that we do not isolate.

When it comes to empowering the continent, we do ourselves a disservice by saying, “You are not black enough” or “You are not African enough.” Because Africans go to Europe and improve the culture — evolve the culture, the language, the music, the art, the sport and everything else.

And when the reverse happens, we get scared or anxious about it. As long as we are shaping the narrative and we are not being overrun by the other voices, it’s important to invite many voices because it’s really about your sensibility, not the color of your skin.

But it’s always about work that relates to the continent. I would say that your color of skin is not important.

Q.

You talk about Africa, but what does Morocco have in common with Ethiopia, or Ghana? What do you mean when you say Africa?

A.

Africa is the most diverse continent on the planet. So our job really is to tell the stories of these various disparate communities. Presenting these wonderful diverse stories makes us richer.

I don’t think that I have one Africa. I’m a Pan-Africanist. I believe the Pan-Africanist approach is so much more interesting, more fun and more empowering, but at the same time we embrace the diversity across the continent because that makes us richer.

Q.

Then what is the commonality? That they were all colonies of Europe?

A.

Absolutely. The colonial history and the legacy have created a post-colonial continent with post-colonial trauma. We have the symptoms of trauma across the continent as a common theme. So I really don’t want to emphasize too much the negative, but people talk about colonization or colonialism as a stain, but it’s better understood as being actually woven into the very fabric of the continent.

Q.

Can that be transformed into something useful or positive?

A.

It must be, because decolonization starts by owning up to the fact that it’s already intricately woven into our DNA. And once you accept that position, then it empowers you to evolve from that.

When we think about art on the continent, the instinct is to look back. And that nostalgia for the past has kept the continent trapped in this loop.

We look back to before the colonialists’ intervention, to the masks, the sculptures, the objects. But we cannot go back to the masks. We love them, we think they’re beautiful and along with the pyramids they are a testament to the ingenuity of the people on the continent. But going back to that is almost like denying the fact that we have evolved and we are learning and we are able to take from the colonialists and shape a new language, shape a new culture. Because culture really is progressive if you want to find your peace, your balance, to feed your mind, to feed your soul in this world.

We want a future. You see the term Afrofuturism everywhere. We curated a show for the festival four years ago about Afrofuturism — Africans imagining a better future for themselves using technologies, many of which were not created on the continent.

So when you talk about colonization, it’s about saying, “We’re going to shape our future now.” And really shape and control every narrative.

You know the story of the hunt is told by the hunter. The lion will always be the victim. If the lion would be able to tell its own story, the story would be different.

We bumbled and stumbled into all this slaughter.”

The American forces took the island in 76 hours, but the toll was brutal: About 1,000 Marines died, and 2,296 were wounded. The New York Times wrote, “Riddled corpses form a ghastly fringe along the narrow white beaches where men of the Second Marine Division died for every foot of sand.”

Tarawa was the first of six Pacific battles, including Iwo Jima, that Mr. Cooper participated in. But it was the one that never left him.

Tarawa continued to anger him for years and caused nightmares; in one, he said, he dreamed he was falling deep underwater before encountering a young boy sitting on a submerged Sherman tank.

“You never really lose the memory of the sounds, the smells and everything, including the blood running down your nose so you’re smelling blood instead of breathing,” he told Armchair General magazine in 2009.

His return to Tarawa for the documentary in 2008 brought back a flood of memories as he walked the beach where he had carried Marines into ferocious Japanese crossfire.

“I smell the stench of those bodies rotting in the sun,” he said. “It still comes back to me.”

Leon Cooper was born on Oct. 23, 1919, in Chicago. His father, William Sr., owned gas stations and was later a bookkeeper. His mother, the former Rachel Rossman, was a homemaker who became a saleswoman at Lane Bryant after ulcers made her husband too ill to continue working. To help his once-prosperous family make ends meet, Leon became a caddy and his brother William Jr. a prizefighter.

Mr. Cooper enlisted in the wartime Navy after graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in government, finance and accounting.

After the war, his family said, Mr. Cooper held federal and state government jobs, started a computer training school and was an executive at Teledyne and Litton Industries. He later helped invent a smoke detector tester and sold it for many years through his company, Home Safeguard Industries.

In the 1990s he began to write books, all but one about war. While researching “The War in the Pacific: A Retrospective” (2006), he learned that Red Beach on Betio, where he had delivered Marines, had become a dump, strewn with trash and in some places human excrement.

“Garbage lay everywhere on what to me was hallowed ground, where I saw so many of my countrymen killed or wounded by Japanese,” he said in the Armchair General interview.

Revisiting his past kindled Mr. Cooper’s late-in-life activism, which suited his gregarious, blunt-spoken and profane personality.

Disgusted by the conditions on the beach, he began contacting members of Congress to authorize funding to clean it up, a campaign that has not yet succeeded.

Steven Barber, the director of “Return to Tarawa,” said in an interview that Mr. Cooper had trouble persuading some members of Congress to take him seriously. In an attempt to lobby Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, he said, “Leon was beating on her door screaming, `Throw some alms to the poor!’ ”

But Representative Henry Waxman, another California Democrat, was more sympathetic. In remarks in 2006 in the Congressional Record praising Mr. Cooper, Mr. Waxman said, “The sanctity of our battlefield, monuments and veterans’ institutions is of utmost importance to preserve military history and pay respect to those who fought.”

Mr. Cooper made a stronger impact after “Return to Tarawa” was televised. It showed him, dismayed but relentless, walking the beach and spotting old gun emplacements and other artifacts of the battle; talking to local government officials of the Republic of Kiribati, of which Tarawa is part, and meeting people who had uncovered Marine remains.

“You look down in the ground,” he said in the film, “and you see the mortal remains of somebody — Japanese or American.”

Video

The broadcast led Representative Dan Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois, to draft language in the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act in the hope of persuading the Pentagon to make the return of Marines’ remains from Tarawa a higher priority.

In 2015, after 39 sets of remains were recovered, Mr. Cooper said the scope of his quest had expanded to all service members still missing in action in the Pacific Theater.

“More of our guys lie in unmarked graves in the Pacific than in Europe, where battles were in areas with urban populations,” he told the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.

In addition to his son William, he is survived by his daughters, Katie and Jeanie Cooper; two other sons, Peter and Lee; and six grandchildren. His wife, the former Alberta Brown, died in 1994.

Mr. Cooper believed that the Battle of Tarawa had been poorly planned and should never have been fought.

Examples abound of people who are dumped from such policies or denied coverage, mired in debt and medical bills totaling thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.

One case pending in federal court involves Kevin Conroy, who had a heart attack in 2014 and underwent triple bypass surgery, just two months after his wife, Linda, obtained a short-term policy over the telephone.

Their insurer, HHC Life, refused to pay the bills.

“We freaked out,” Ms. Conroy said. “What were we going to do? It was $900,000.”

The insurer informed the Conroys the policy was “rescinded,” to use the industry jargon. After poring through his medical records, HCC claimed Mr. Conroy failed to disclose he suffered from alcoholism and degenerative disc disease, conditions he said were never diagnosed. “When one thing didn’t work, they went to another,” Mr. Conroy said.

HCC Life, a unit of Tokio Marine HCC, says it will defend its case. The company is also the subject of a multistate review by insurance regulators to see if it engaged in unfair or deceptive acts. It says it has fully cooperated. HCC Life stopped selling short-term policies last May.

A major player in this area is UnitedHealth Group, which abandoned the Affordable Care Act market after incurring sizable losses. United offers short-term plans through its Golden Rule unit. Before the federal law, Golden Rule was among those insurers criticized for rescinding policies. The company recently told investors it was excited by the president’s executive order because that would mean an increase in business for these plans.

Last year, a short-term policy averaged $109 a month for an individual, according to a recent analysis by eHealth, an online broker, compared with $378 a month during last year’s open enrollment period for an A.C.A. plan.

The policies are particularly attractive to the millions of people who don’t qualify for federal subsidies; only about half of the 17 million people buying coverage are subsidized, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Another target audience would be the 28 million who are uninsured. And some brokers are deliberately promoting the policies without pointing out they do not meet the same levels of coverage of A.C.A. plans, said Scott Flanders, the chief executive of eHealth. “They’re selling the hell out of it,” he said.

Jeff Smedsrud, a founder of Healthcare.com, an online insurance shopping site, “There are companies that aggressively, and some very aggressively, market it as a panacea.”

In recent years, state regulators have investigated the marketing practices of particular brokers, and consumers have sued to expose the actions of some bad actors.

In Pennsylvania during the past two years, the state took action against seven agents for misrepresenting the plans they sold. One woman who had a stroke was left with $250,000 in unpaid medical bills because the policy did not cover prescription drugs and other basic treatment.

While a handful of states, including New Jersey, now effectively ban short-term plans, others review rates and make sure the policies follow state law, said Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University.



But other states will likely do little to prevent more sales of these policies, said Katherine Hempstead, a policy expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “You’re going to make it easier in places where it is already easy,” she said.

Industry experts estimate as many as a million people may now have these policies, though the official tally is much lower. And others may fall under this umbrella, because it’s hard to distinguish from alternatives, like so-called limited benefit plans, which cap how much the insurer will pay, and association plans, available to small businesses, that will also be expanded under Mr. Trump’s executive order.

Several companies are poised to capitalize on a less restrictive environment. Health Insurance Innovations, which markets short-term policies, including those once offered by HCC Life, is under scrutiny by state insurance regulators. It recently told investors that there were “tens of millions” of people who could benefit from these plans. The company declined to comment.

These plans typically offer much higher commissions to brokers selling them, and they can be much more profitable for insurers. UnitedHealth’s Golden Rule spent about half of every dollar it took in premiums for medical expenses, according to regulatory filings. Under the federal law, insurers must spend at least 80 cents of each dollar on care for their customers. UnitedHealth declined to comment.

Some experts speculate that insurers are likely to exploit the existing A.C.A. market as a way of selling short-term policies to people until they have serious medical conditions. Coverage sold under the federal law would become increasingly expensive, with people priced out of the market if they didn’t get subsidies, Mr. Laszewski, the industry consultant, said.

While the market for subsidized coverage is largely protected, the market for those who pay the full cost is already shrinking, he said.

Like the insurance that was sold before the federal health care law, people with chronic conditions or a history of illness are mostly turned away. Companies will sometimes rescind policies if an individual has high medical bills.

UnitedHealth’s Golden Rule recently won a lawsuit involving one of its short-term policies, claiming it did not have to cover $400,000 in medical bills because it said a woman with breast cancer had an abnormal mammogram before she enrolled. The case is being appealed.



“Insurance companies today are interpreting their short-term health insurance policies so as to label any condition that arises during the policy term as a pre-existing condition for which the company can exclude coverage,” said a lawyer representing Ms. Jones in a statement. UnitedHealth declined to comment.

Customers often have had to argue about whether something was a pre-existing condition. When Karen Campbell and her husband looked for insurance before Obamacare, “we had this extensive, unbelievable interview, each of us about our medical history,” she said. After rupturing her Achilles’ tendon, which required $30,000 in surgery and physical therapy, the insurer asked for medical records to make sure it wasn’t something she previously had. “They just made it really difficult,” Ms. Campbell said.

Grace Wood, an instructor at a university in San Francisco, bought a short-term plan in 2013. When she had to have a heart procedure, her insurer, HCC Life, balked, leaving her with roughly $150,000 in unpaid medical bills.

“Why should I go bankrupt?” Ms. Wood recalled asking herself. It took her a year and a half, but she appealed and turned to regulators when the insurer ignored her. HCC eventually paid the claims.","Without Obamacare Mandate, ‘You Open the Floodgates’ for Skimpy Health Plans",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/health/health-insurance-obamacare-mandate.html

SUNDAY PUZZLE — It’s rare that a crossword puzzle spills its answers completely in the revealer, but if you have a sharp eye, you’ll see it today.

All you need to solve this puzzle are some fingers. Maybe some toes.

Today’s Theme

Oh, and it helps to follow the instructions. Tom McCoy is back and he would like you to count the ANSWER LENGTHs of the theme entries, as it says in the revealer at 110A.

For example, 110A asks us to count the number of letters in each theme answer and, at 22A, the clue reads “This clue’s 110-Across, timewise.” Count up the letters in the answer MIDNIGHT HOUR, and you get 12, which is, indeed, the MIDNIGHT HOUR. Similarly, at 28A, the DIVER’S GOAL at the Olympics is 10/10, and there are 10 letters in DIVER’S GOAL.

Is there more? You can count on it. The four-letter bonus entry in the circled squares spells out FOUR, which is the only number that is its own length long (Mr. McCoy explains that better in his notes below).

MONDAY PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle by Kevin Christian has a note on it that says that the print version has a visual element that was not able to be reproduced for the online and app versions.

The puzzle is solvable either way, but the visuals make things easier and, this being a Monday puzzle, that’s what we’re here for, right? The addition of the visuals definitely make this a Monday. Without them, you can still get the theme, but it might not grow on you, so to speak, until you get to the bottom of the puzzle.

If you would like to see the visuals, I’ve put them here.

Today’s Theme

What do the six actors in the films in Mr. Christian’s theme have in common? MULLETs! They all wore their hair in the MULLET hairstyle during the filming of the movies in the clues. (Hi, kids! Ask your folks about their “Business in the front, party in the back” hair. Demand to see photos.)

Mr. Christian, who is a very nice man, is kind enough to remind us of this embarrassing period in our lives, when so many men — and some women — wore their hair this way that is was briefly declared the state haircut of New Jersey [That’s not even remotely true. — Ed.]

That’s our theme today: Hair regret.

Tricky Clues

Honestly, I was so distracted by the MULLET flashbacks that I didn’t notice if there were any difficult clues. All I can say is, make sure you know your root beers. It comes up twice today.

Constructor Notes

The mullet is the greatest hairstyle ever invented. It is the greatest hairstyle ever invented because it makes a man look like a lion. What man wouldn’t want to look like a lion? Lions are awesome. They’re the kings of the jungle. That’s why mullets are awesome. I used to have a mullet. I’m 53 years old. That means I was born in 1964. That means I was between the ages of 16 and 26 during the 80s. Of course I rocked a mullet. In fact, I have a photo of myself from 1987 where I have a mullet and a giant ZZ Top beard. Top that. I shaved it when I returned from 4-1/2 months in Europe and had to get a real job. I remember when my mullet disappeared. It was not of my own choosing. I would go to get my hair cut, and I would say, “I want it short on the sides and long in the back.” How hard is that to understand? Not very hard. However, I noticed as the years went by, the hairstylists ignored me. They didn’t leave it long in the back. It kept getting shorter and shorter in the back. I was so sad. Perhaps the hairstylists were trying to save me from myself. On a crossword note … I have a version of this grid that has JOE DIRT and CHAPPIE across the middle instead of RAMBO. That’s one more theme answer and nine more theme letters. I went with the RAMBO version instead because it has cleaner fill. Plus, I didn’t want to lose RAMBO. Who doesn’t love Sylvester Stallone in a mullet? We all love Sylvester Stallone in a mullet. All other mullets pale in comparison.

From transferring money to buying airline tickets, smartphone apps can be a traveler’s high-tech multitasker. But can they keep travelers safe? A new crop of apps seeks to offer that assurance.

They may be cashing in on a sense of insecurity wrought by more frequent terrorist events, including the truck attack in Lower Manhattan in October, and recent natural disasters like hurricanes.

“There are more risks now than in the past, but that doesn’t make travel more dangerous,” said Matthew Bradley, the regional director of security for International SOS, a medical and travel security risk services company. He cited the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris as ushering in the risk of terrorism to Europe that was once seen as unlikely .

Still, car accidents and petty crimes such as pickpocketing are much more common travel threats than terrorism or kidnapping. To mitigate these risks, experts advise hiring drivers in foreign countries, carrying little cash and dressing inconspicuously to avoid attracting attention.

“Americans have a lot of tells,” said Bruce A. Alexander, a terrorism expert and the former Iraq program manager in the antiterrorism office at the State Department. “Leave the San Diego State sweatshirt at home.”

Supplementing these practices, security apps deliver incident updates in the location where a user is traveling. Notifications range from supplying country profiles before departure to alerts about disease outbreaks. Many also contain a panic button to summon assistance in an emergency.

While few of these security apps replace travel insurance, which covers the cost of a medical emergency or evacuation, many do provide a range of services designed to keep travelers safe.

Tracking users and triggering cost-free evacuations

A new app from the London-based security firm Drum Cussac, CloseCircle, which is scheduled to be available this month (December), is designed to act as a security monitor and emergency evacuation service. The app digitally transmits your location to staff at headquarters (the firm says it just uses three percent of your phone’s battery power over 24 hours). When an emergency such as a terrorist attack or a hurricane occurs where you are traveling, company employees will call, check in and advise users on avoiding risk and getting out of harm’s way. When under threat, users can also engage an SOS button that summons a response from its agents.

Unlike other security apps, CloseCircle membership guarantees a cost-free evacuation in the event of life-threatening danger. The service is backed by an insurance policy that covers the expenses.

“CloseCircle is aiming to be pre-emptive wherever possible and to actually warn members away from dangers that they may not even yet be aware of,” Simon Philips, the chairman of Drum Cussac, wrote in an email.

Terms: Annual memberships cost £195 a person, or about $260; £349 a couple; and £595 for a family of up to six people; closecircle.com.

Tracking users on demand

Developed by Incident Management Group, a firm that specializes in the security of business travelers and individuals, FoneTrac allows users to check in at the press of a button to let the firm and anyone on their designated contact list know that they are fine. The company also monitors security developments worldwide and will send a message to app users if anything from a terrorist attack to an earthquake is going on where they are. In the event of an emergency, a panic button provides the firm your location and triggers g round support .

The app does not track a user’s physical location continuously, except in the event of a panic alert when it runs continuously, but inconspicuously, until it is physically turned off.

Terms: $15 a month for a minimum of three months; fonetrac-go.com.

Focusing on health and safety

Established in 2012 and available on a mobile app since 2013, Sitata sends out “Trip Alerts” that cover any potentially travel-disrupting event, other than the usual flight delays. These could be disease outbreaks, violent protests, extreme weather or transit strikes. The coverage is global and the firm uses artificial intelligence to monitor the media, traditional and social, to track events worldwide.

Founded by Ron St. John, the former director of emergency preparedness for Canada, and his son Adam St. John, the app was initially developed to disseminate public health information and expanded to more broadly address security. It remains strong in tracking disease outbreaks; the app will even inform users after they have returned from a trip if a disease such as dengue fever has broken out where they were traveling and if there was an incubation period.

“This is important because you may come home and start to feel sick and go to your doctor and forget to say you were in Brazil, which could lead to misdiagnosis,” said Adam St. John, the chief executive officer of Sitata.

Terms: Free for now, though the company plans to change in 2018 to a modestly priced subscription service; sitata.com.

Emergency alerts in New York and San Francisco

Currently available only in New York and San Francisco, the new app Citizen alerts users to some events that have triggered a 911 call to local authorities. This could be any emergency related to public safety such as a bank robbery, fire or terrorist attack.

If the event takes place within a quarter mile of your location, and the app is running, you will receive a push notification with the alert. Users are also able to discuss the incidents among themselves via the app, which displays a map showing where incidents are occurring.

Originally launched as Vigilante, the company quickly rebranded after it became aware the name appeared to incite citizen action. “The name didn’t match our goal which is to keep people safe and not to encourage them to intervene and disrupt police officers,” said Lea Artz, a spokeswoman for Citizen.

Terms: Free; citizen.com.

A smartwatch panic button

ADT, the home security company, has announced its intention to follow its customers beyond their homes with its first app, ADT Panic Response, available only on Samsung Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches.

Watch wearers can engage the app in an emergency, which transmits a GPS location and connects to an ADT agent to dispatch help. The service is only available in the United States.

“We like wearables because someone who might go out running tends not to take a smartphone with them because it’s bulky and heavy,” said Jay Darfler, the senior vice president of emerging markets at ADT. In the running example, he added, the user had turned his ankle in the woods, was unable to walk and summoned help via the watch app. The company plans to launch a related smartphone app next year.

Terms: $10 a month; adtcanopy.com.

It was in hopes of bringing more clarity to the increasingly tangled question of how endurance training affects hearts that researchers from the University of Minnesota, Stanford University and other institutions decided, for the new study, to zero in on a unique group of runners: men who had participated in at least 25 consecutive Twin Cities marathons in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

These 50 runners, identified by marathon participation logs, turned out to have completed, collectively, 3,510 marathons, with each runner, individually, having finished anywhere from 27 to 171 of the races.

The men obviously were experienced endurance athletes. They had trained for at least 26 years, and some for more than 50. Many had started competing in high school or earlier, but others had come to the sport much later, often, the researchers report, in hopes of ameliorating the effects of past lifestyle choices, such as smoking or junk food diets. Most were lean at the time of the study, but a few qualified as overweight, based on their body mass indexes.

Most ran 30 miles per week or more.

The researchers had each of these runners fill out detailed questionnaires about their training routines, as well as their general health history and habits.

Then they scanned the runners’ hearts to look for atherosclerosis.

Sixteen of the runners proved to have no plaque in their arteries at all. The rest had some deposits, with 12 displaying slight amounts, another 12 moderate levels, and 10 having worrisomely large deposits of plaques.

When the scientists compared the men’s running histories to their scan results, however, they found little relationship between how much they had run overall and how much plaque they had in their arteries. Those men who had run the greatest number of marathons did not tend to have less, or more, arterial plaque than the men who had run fewer races, indicating that extreme running itself had not increased the severity of heart disease.

On the other hand, a history of heavy smoking and high cholesterol was linked to greater levels of plaque, especially in the men who had begun running later in life.

The good news was that these findings suggest that years of hard running had not harmed the men’s hearts, says Dr. William O. Roberts, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of Minnesota, who led the study, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Indeed, all that running probably helped to keep some runners’ arteries clear.

But the exercise also had not inoculated those with a history of unwise lifestyle choices, especially smoking, against developing heart disease.

“You can’t just outrun your past,” Dr. Roberts says.

Of course, this study was relatively small and focused on Caucasian men with the physical, economic and psychological wherewithal to run competitively for years. Whether the results apply equally to other people and other sports is unclear. (Dr. Roberts and his collaborators published a small study earlier this year of female marathon runners that found almost no plaques in their hearts.)

This type of study also can show only relationships between running and heart health. It cannot prove that running directly caused any changes in the heart.

Still, the results may help to quell some runners’ and their families’ worries about the cardiac demands of long-term training. But if you misspent your youth smoking and eating poorly or have a family history of cardiac disease, you might want to talk with your physician about having your heart assessed, Dr. Roberts says, even if you have completed a marathon or two, or even 100.",How Running May or May Not Help the Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/well/move/running-marathons-heart-health.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The cuts would be automatic, the consequence of a 2010 law that Congress passed to keep itself from increasing the deficit too much.

The biggest program affected would be Medicare, the health insurance program for older people and the disabled. But the law allows Medicare to take only a relatively small cut: 4 percent. Other programs have no such protection. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit increase from the tax bill would be large enough — $1.5 trillion over 10 years — that spending for the unprotected programs would be reduced to zero next year and nearly zero over the next nine years.

Each bubble above represents the size of an automatic budget cut that could take place next year.

The Statutory Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010, or Paygo, is an Obama-era update of a rule first enacted under President George H.W. Bush. It requires that legislation that adds to the federal deficit be paid for with spending cuts, increases in revenue or other offsets.

With the exception of Social Security, the post office and many income-based programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps, most mandatory spending programs — those automatically funded on a continuing basis, rather than appropriated year by year — are subject to Paygo. In 2018, for example, the law would claim $14 billion in various farm aid programs; $1.7 billion for Social Services block grants, which states use to help fund foster care, Meals on Wheels and other programs; and $69 million for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.

Congress has found a way to slip around the rule in the past by including an exception in legislation from the Paygo cuts. But because of the special budget process Republicans are using for tax overhaul this year, the tax bill itself can’t include such an exception. Congress could prevent the cuts by passing separate legislation by the end of the year, but that measure would need 60 votes in the Senate, requiring several Democrats to support it. The cuts also require action from the White House, though the law does not give it much discretion to avoid them.

Certain government programs receive a mixture of mandatory and appropriated funds, so the mandatory cuts won’t eliminate them entirely. The Women, Infants and Children program, which provides food assistance, gets most of its $6.2 billion from a fund that is not subject to Paygo cuts. So even though it might be subject to a $1 million cut, that would only be a tiny fraction of its entire funding. Some programs have special rules. One fund, for military retiree benefits, will still get paid even if it gets zeroed out under the automatic cuts.

Given the popularity of many of the programs subject to the Paygo cuts, it’s possible lawmakers may find a way to avert them.

No matter the time of year, with the December holidays being the exception, a luxury vacation to Australia on a limited budget is definitely doable, according to John Cantrell, an Australia specialist with the New York City travel company Indagare.

“Australia isn’t exactly a bargain destination, but you can make your money go further if you know where to spend it there and where not to,” he said. Mr. Cantrell has a few other tips on how to enjoy a high-end getaway to Australia without breaking the bank.

Fly, Don’t Drive

Car rentals in Australia can be expensive. Domestic flights, on the other hand, on Australian carriers such as Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar and Tigerair are very reasonably priced. Round-trip airfare between Sydney and Melbourne, for example, can be as low as $150. Flying is also much more convenient. “You’ll find several dozen flight options a day from multiple destinations around the country,” Mr. Cantrell said. Unless you specifically want the driving experience, opt for a flight.

Join the Locals

Some agencies and operators that arrange trips to Australia try to sell tourists pricey experiences such as a private charter of a luxury catamaran to sail around Sydney Harbor, an excursion that can run $1,000 or more. Most of these tours aren’t worth the money, Mr. Cantrell said.

“Your trip will be more authentic and affordable if you follow in the footsteps of the locals,” he said. Much of that same view from the expensive private catamaran, for example, can be enjoyed on the ferry that transports Sydney residents from Circular Quay to Manly Beach. Similarly, there’s no need to splurge on prime seats for the opera or a concert, even at the Sydney Opera House. There are plenty of last-minute inexpensive tickets available there, or to operas and outdoor concerts all over the country. Money-conscious Australians buy these, and you should, too.

Stretch Your Dining Budget

When he’s helping families with their Australia travel itineraries, Mr. Cantrell has two suggestions to save on food costs. First, he encourages picnic lunches. His top recommendation: “Pick up produce, cheese and other food from farmers’ markets and specialty gourmet shops, along with a bottle of delicious local wine, and enjoy a bargain feast on Sydney’s Bondi Beach.”

Second, take advantage of the country’s many lively cafes. They’re a big part of the local culture and offer tasty and inexpensive meals, including local favorites.

Compare Prices at Upscale Hotels

Five-star hotels in Australia have a wide range of pricing, even when they are in the same region. Near the Great Barrier Reef, for example, a stay at Heron Island Resort comes at much lower prices, compared with other hotels nearby. Before you commit to any one hotel, Mr. Cantrell said, be sure that you’re getting the most value for your money by comparing rates, especially if you can be flexible with your check-in and checkout dates.

In Sydney and Melbourne, Rent an Apartment

Get the true flavor of these popular destinations by renting an apartment instead of booking a hotel room. “The magic of these cities is integrating with the local lifestyle, and that’s sometimes hard to get when staying at a hotel,” Mr. Cantrell said. “Both Sydney and Melbourne have many picturesque neighborhoods, where apartment rentals can be inexpensive.”

Peruse the plethora of options on sites like Airbnb and Luxico. Similarly, an Australian travel specialist, such as Mr. Cantrell, can also help you find rentals.

Fifty years ago this Sunday, the first adult human heart transplant was performed in Cape Town. It was an epoch-making advance in science — and also, perhaps, in human culture. The heart, heavy as it is with symbolism, has always occupied a special place in our collective imagination. Despite our relatively sophisticated biomedical understanding of its function, many people still think of the heart as the seat of affection and courage. When Barney Clark, a retired dentist with end-stage heart failure, received the world’s first permanent mechanical heart in 1982, his wife worried he might not still be able to love her.

A heart transplant is the definitive treatment for the most severe stages of heart failure, a disease that afflicts six million Americans (and a quarter of a million in its most advanced form). But as recently as the early 1960s, transplanting a human heart seemed like a pipe dream. Organ rejection and life-threatening infections posed prohibitive risks. By the second half of the decade, however, animal research had pointed a path toward human transplantation.

In the end, the race to transplant a human heart — a story engagingly told in Donald McRae’s 2006 book, “Every Second Counts” — involved four surgeons, the most compelling of whom were Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town and Norman Shumway at Stanford. The two had been surgical residents together at the University of Minnesota, and by many accounts they had a frosty relationship. Dr. Shumway scorned what he saw as Dr. Barnard’s showmanship, aggressiveness and willingness to cut corners. Dr. Barnard, for his part, was resentful that his colleague seemed to view him primarily as a foreigner from a pariah country.

Dr. Barnard faced a considerable disadvantage in that Dr. Shumway had a great deal more experience with animal transplants, which he had helped pioneer. In 1959, Dr. Shumway and Richard Lower, a Stanford resident, performed the first dog heart transplant. The recipient lived for eight days, demonstrating that an organ could be transplanted from one animal to another and continue to function. By 1967, about two-thirds of Dr. Shumway’s research dogs were able to live for a year or more. At that point, he had transplanted hearts into nearly 300 dogs. Dr. Barnard had done about 50.

In late 1967, Dr. Shumway announced that he was going to start a clinical trial at Stanford that would lead to the first heart transplant in a human. “Although animal work should and will continue,” he said, “we are none the less at the threshold of clinical application.” But it was Dr. Shumway who was at a disadvantage when it came to finding a human donor. American regulations at the time prohibited organ collection from brain-dead patients if their hearts were still beating. The heart had to stop completely before organs could be harvested. Otherwise, a surgeon could theoretically be charged with murder.

Dr. Barnard, on the other hand, was governed by more liberal laws in South Africa — legislation he himself had presciently advocated — which allowed a neurosurgeon to confirm death if a patient showed no response to light or pain, a much lower bar. Once family consent was obtained, a transplant team could quickly harvest organs, including the heart, while they were still being perfused with blood.","Happy Anniversary, Heart Transplant",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/opinion/sunday/anniversary-heart-transplant.html

“The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight.
“I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said.","When Kwasi Boyd-Bouldin and his family migrated to Hollywood in 1980, they found a neighborhood of short brick apartment buildings, strip mall laundromats and liquor stores with bars on the windows and doors.

They had escaped from New York to California the romantic way, by train, three kids in their tweens and teens. They had fled Brownsville, Brooklyn, at a time the New York City was broke and dirty and crawling with mobsters.

Change was necessary. Also, Kwasi’s father had moved to Hollywood shortly after he was born. If they were going to have a relationship — and his mother wanted them to — they would have to live nearby. That this lead them to the land of endless sun and countless movie stars made the move seem charmed, even magical.

Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, now 40, grew up on the streets of a humble neighborhood in Los Angeles that would eventually go bad. It would even claim one of his sisters during the crack era. But he still loved Hollywood. As a near-native, he rolled through the sun-bleached streets on his skateboard, taking in the scenery. He picked up his first camera, an Olympus Pen-F half-frame his dad left him, at 23, a trained observer of his cityscape. He’d studied the alleys and avenues, the angles of buildings against the sky, like Jane Goodall studied lowland gorillas.

These days, when he is not at his day job (as an education technology specialist at a Pasadena art school), Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who is married and has two daughters, is haunting the streets of his youth. “The Los Angeles Recordings,” his continuing documentary profile of his adopted hometown, serves as a visual introduction to his Hollywood, as he likes to say, among other fond places.

He began the project two years ago in reaction to the head-turning physical changes in the landscape that gentrification brought to the city — the same story playing out in cities across the country, from Seattle to Philadelphia.

The Los Angeles Recordings include photo essays from “South of the 10 Freeway,” “The Liquor Store,” “The Displacement Engine” and other aspects of a city transforming faster than generations of working-class and lower-middle-class residents can handle.

There is no glitz here; no glamour peeking from behind the palm trees against the short, squat locksmith or the auto body shop.

In part, he says, the project is his intention to document a vanishing L.A. Few who live outside it even know exists. He wants “to present a portrait of the city that reflects the lives of people who live in Los Angeles, as opposed to the glossy fictional version that dominates the mainstream narrative.”

“People are just being priced out, and the speed in which it is happening is unbelievable,” said Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who currently lives in Toluca Lake, a neighborhood near Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley.

“Visually,” he said, “the landscape of the area is being transformed as well because many of the complexes being erected are so large they completely alter the skyline.

Most, if not all, of the complexes being built cater to the affluent, so they are unattainable to the people they are displacing.”

For his Hollywood portrait, the landscapes are stripped of clutter — for the most part, he leaves people out of the frame. In his Hollywood, short, square cinder box buildings with signs for muffler repair, locksmiths, cobblers, and the iconic liquor store are recorded for posterity like the last of endangered species. He eschews the easy shot, the construction cranes behind the vacant lots where aging apartments once stood. Mr. Boyd-Bouldin’s portrait is of an old familial Hollywood that is here today but may be gone tomorrow. The sun-washed skies and lonely streets give some images a dreamy, faraway tone.

As he describes them: “From an outside perspective, some may see only vacant lots and other signs of urban decay. But it’s important to take a more critical look at these areas.”

What he is trying to do, he says, is to not only document the transformation but to provide insight into the impact these changes have had on the city. To what end, he is not sure. “The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight. “I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said. “It’s the city and place that made me who I am today.”

While napping at the apartment one day, Ms. Stevens had a series of flashbacks and nightmares: Ms. Berman even made an image of Ms. Stevens in the midst of one episode.
Ms. Stevens eventually resettled in New York, where Ms. Berman spent years advocating for her care and speaking with her doctors and social workers.
Both cared deeply about verifying Ms. Stevens’ memories — Ms. Berman went as far as to go to London to corroborate her recollections and make images that spoke to them.
Ms. Berman and Ms. Stevens each characterized their relationship in different ways at different times — photographer-subject, mother-daughter, caregiver-patient, and collaborators.","In the first pages of “An Autobiography of Miss Wish,” the reader meets Kimberly Stevens multiple times: In handwritten notes; dark, cinematic images; drawings of knives and books; and a beaming childhood portrait. Then there’s her psychiatric history written in detached clinical jargon, and a portrait of her prone, living on the street.

This visceral book lays out her life, drawing readers in even before fully understanding what they are looking at. “An autobiography of Miss Wish” is a collaboration between Nina Berman, a documentary photographer, and Ms. Stevens, a survivor of sex trafficking and child pornography whom Ms. Berman met 27 years ago in London.

Ms. Berman had traveled there to photograph the impact of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s policies. She met Ms. Stevens, who at the time went by Cathy, while photographing young drug users living on the streets. The others she met had been standoffish, but Cathy was curious and fascinated to learn more about the U.S. Over the course of the time of their subsequent relationship spanning decades and continents, Ms. Stevens faced chronic homelessness, drug use, mental illness, and severe post-traumatic stress from the years of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse in childhood.

Medical records, diaries, and letters in the book show how her abusers cowed her into silence and brutally punished her when she spoke up. They also attest to how she was failed by people with whom she shared her tale. A back-and-forth — of wanting to share yet being terrified of the consequences — runs throughout the entire book.

“I thought it would be the most powerful move I could do, to tell everything I had been told to keep a secret my whole life,” Ms. Stevens said. “I can look at [this book] and close it again.”

Ms. Stevens was born poor, a young girl of color adopted into a middle class white family, and was often put in danger by the authority figures in her life. In her earliest writings, it is clear that she knew her word would be doubted, and that the burden of proof would be on her. So she began collecting things.

“I’ve spent my entire life collecting evidence,” she said. “I used to go with my family and take things from various places — in a constant fight to prove what happened.”

The twist in her case was she had Ms. Berman’s help in safeguarding the material, a challenge given Ms. Stevens’s chronic homelessness. The documents, writings and drawings by and about Ms. Stevens constitute a remarkable record about a life that far too often would otherwise go unnoticed and unchronicled.

The book comes out at a time when headlines about sexual violence are a daily occurrence, given the recent outpouring of accounts of sexual harassment and assault in the worlds of film, finance and media.

“Women of a certain privilege are speaking out in every industry,” Ms. Berman said. “It is tremendously important, and hopefully people will start to understand that this is endemic.”

For Ms. Berman, the book is in some ways a continuation of the work she has done over her career, addressing recurring themes, like how hierarchies of power operate, how justice is fought for and found, and how individuals live with the effects of violence. Yet, it is a departure, too, because it is more personal and non-traditional than her previous projects.

“This is work that I live,” she said, “not just a project that I go out and conceive of and go out and shoot.”

Though the London images went unpublished — editors were blasé — Ms. Stevens traveled to New York in 1991 thanks to prize money from a music competition and ended up staying with Ms. Berman. While napping at the apartment one day, Ms. Stevens had a series of flashbacks and nightmares: Ms. Berman even made an image of Ms. Stevens in the midst of one episode. That was the last one she took of her, aside for snapshots for family albums, until around 2008, since she felt uncomfortable photographing her in that vulnerable state.

Ms. Stevens eventually resettled in New York, where Ms. Berman spent years advocating for her care and speaking with her doctors and social workers. She went through good and terrible phases; both she and Ms. Berman were uncertain if she would even survive. But she did, and the two discussed collaborating on a book about her journey.

The process involved both of them anticipating and confronting the pushback they imagined the project would cause. Both cared deeply about verifying Ms. Stevens’ memories — Ms. Berman went as far as to go to London to corroborate her recollections and make images that spoke to them.

“I only included the memories I am fully aware of and very clear on what happened,” Ms. Stevens said. “Everything that’s there, I’m fully aware of.”

This concern about the reliability of traumatic memories reflects not just journalistic standards, but, in recounting sexual violence, it also ties into a larger history of how women’s memories of assault are remembered and accepted.

For example, Dr. Judith Herman’s writings on the history of trauma studies traces the discipline back to Sigmund Freud and his study of women in the late-1800s experiencing what was then called “hysteria.” His interviews with women experiencing flashbacks and nightmares — that are now seen as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, led him to conclude that sexual assault was the root cause. Yet, given how widespread hysteria was among women, he withdrew his findings, because to accept them would mean that sexual assault and abuse were commonplace. Instead, he said his female patients’ “scenes of seduction had never taken place … only fantasies which my patients had made up.”

Women’s testimonies continue to be dismissed, making cases of sexual violence among the hardest crimes to prosecute successfully. “All too often, survivors of sexual violence are challenged and asked to defend their narrative,” Ms. Berman wrote, “while perpetrators, because of the rules of evidence and the fear instilled in victims, are left free to continue to profit from their violent schemes.”

For women who lack the stature of celebrity or access to the media, the book echoes the current conversation and includes a group often excluded. It also challenges traditional storytelling methods and what it means to be on one side of the camera versus the other. Ms. Berman and Ms. Stevens each characterized their relationship in different ways at different times — photographer-subject, mother-daughter, caregiver-patient, and collaborators. Throughout, they spoke often about the effect that they were having on each other and what that meant for their common creation.

Just as important, Ms. Berman rejected a sentiment among some who document the lives of the less fortunate: that they are “giving voice to the voiceless” — a condescending construct, if anything. Ms. Stevens is hardly voiceless, but her voice was suppressed or ignored by authorities and agencies that were supposed to help her.

And while the book is about Ms. Stevens, it is also a glimpse into Ms. Berman’s life, and it contextualizes her other works. In an industry that emphasizes objectivity and erasing oneself from the work, this book allows the reader to see what both Ms. Stevens has lived through and what Ms. Berman has experienced with her. Ms. Stevens’ two suicide attempts at Rikers Island when she was jailed on a minor drug charge showed Ms. Berman the flaws of New York City’s criminal justice system, and these experiences are echoed in her subsequent projects on subjects ranging from police stop-and-frisk policy, to the role of the security state and surveillance in post-9/11 America.

Ultimately, Ms. Stevens hopes this collaborative book will be a testament to resilience.

“I feel a lot stronger having made the book,” she said. “Before that, I felt like a victim. I don’t want to be called a survivor or a victim, I just want to live—I don’t want to just survive. I want to move on to the next chapter of my life.”

But gradually, several of these studios joined forces with universities (Stella Adler was the first to go collegiate, in 1972), where their budgets and institutional power dwarfed the reach of the independent institutions. Meanwhile colleges outside of New York also started to offer theater degrees.

“The colleges became our bigger competition,” said Pamela Moller Kareman, executive director of the Neighborhood Playhouse. Applications for the Playhouse’s conservatory program, based on the techniques of its renowned teacher Sanford Meisner (a Stanislavsky protégé who died in 1997), started to decrease about 10 years ago, she said. The school has responded by investing in recruitment and relying on its star-studded alumni system for support (last April, Joanne Woodward established a scholarship there).

“The acting studios that do not have a university alignment are squeezed,” said Emma Dunch, a fund-raising expert for arts and cultural organizations. Successful acting programs affiliated with higher education include Playwrights Horizons, at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, and the Actors Studio, at Pace University. (The Actors Studio, the legendary free-membership organization whose founding artistic director, Lee Strasberg, perfected the Method Acting technique, is only for professional actors, but also offers a three-year M.F.A. program through Pace.)

“It allowed us to expand,” said Tom Oppenheim, artistic director of the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, about its 45-year partnership with N.Y.U. The school, which counts Elaine Stritch, Warren Beatty and, more recently, Bryce Dallas Howard, among its former students, has four theaters, a professional-quality set design space, and eight rehearsal rooms. Mr. Oppenheim said that he wants to transform the school into more of a cultural institution, rebranding it as the Stella Adler Center for the Arts, and relocating to an even bigger space.

Since N.Y.U. is affiliated with several independent studios, its undergraduate students can travel “through the studio network” to learn different acting techniques after two years, said Rubén Polendo, chair of the drama department at Tisch. “They can stay within one methodology, or switch it up,” he continued. “You may be able to develop those tools in 15 years, but here you can compress that experience.” The compression comes at a steep price, however: one year of undergrad acting at N.Y.U. costs about $55,000.

For comparison, a full-time course load at most independent studios with no university affiliation costs a fraction of that. The T. Schreiber Studio, for example, charges $16,495 a year for its one-year conservatory program, while the fee for the one-year “Hagen Core Training” program at HB Studio, named for the performer and acting teacher Uta Hagen, is $13,500. The Neighborhood Playhouse charges about $16,500 annually for its two-year school.

Although the Playhouse might not be the star generator it was in its 20th-century heyday, its alumni system is vast, loyal and ever-present. Allison Janney has won multiple Emmy Awards and can be seen most recently in the movie “I, Tonya,” which was written by another Playhouse graduate, Steven Rogers. And millennials have a glimmer of hope in the success of the 2011 graduates Mackenzie Davis, who appeared in “Blade Runner 2049,” and Jasmine Cephas Jones, who played Peggy Schuyler in the Broadway cast of “Hamilton.”

A successful alumni network will no doubt help the Playhouse face the daunting task of maintaining the 1920s-era property it owns.

“It’s like driving a 1947 Chevy,” said Ms. Moller Kareman of the Playhouse, which has been on East 54th Street since Irene and Alice Lewisohn, its founders, bought the two adjacent buildings in Midtown in 1947. The Playhouse has five floors, including a light-filled dance studio designed by Martha Graham, as well as a 99-seat theater.

“We are all afraid of the roof caving in,” said Ms. Moller Kareman, who had to pay $20,000 to fix the building’s out-of-commission elevator when she was first hired. “The elevator guys said we don’t even have parts for this anymore,” she recalled.",Acting Studios Are Struggling.

Equally taxing is the layering of ingredients — masa; either meat, seafood or vegetables; and Spanish-style extras like olives, raisins or chickpeas — onto sheets of banana leaf and parchment paper. Those are all folded into rectangular little packages and tied up, two at a time, into a pair of pasteles that everyone calls “la junta.” (And before anyone can take a bite, each pastel must be boiled for an hour.)

“They are a pain in the balloons,” said Hernan Rodriguez, 52, who was born in Puerto Rico and has lived in New York City since 1987. His wife, the food writer Kathleen Squires, has written lovingly about his family’s holiday pastelada, or pastel-making party, in Puerto Rico. Mr. Rodriguez, who hosts a New York supper club called Chef’s Dinner Series, said many of his relatives attend with a drink in hand, “grating until they get bored.”

But this year, everyone must pitch in. The plan, Ms. Squires said, is to make as many pasteles as possible “from whatever we can find” at a cousin’s house near San Juan, then give them out to volunteer relief workers and hard-hit communities.

Even when you use a food processor to grate and purée the masa and freeze it in advance (wishful thinking for those without power in Puerto Rico), it’s still “a marathon,” said Angel Roman, 61, a deputy press secretary for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. In his spare time, he promotes the food, music and art of the Puerto Rican diaspora.

Mr. Roman, a second-generation Nuyorican, recently shot video of his sister-in-law Lucy Ramirez as she made pasteles, so as to pass what he fears are rapidly disappearing skills on to the family’s younger members. “Now people say, ‘I want pasteles,’ and they find these entrepreneurs,” Mr. Roman said. “People hand out cards, or they say, ‘Hey, call Doña Maria.’”

In New York, you could also find your pastel maker on Yelp — there’s Cater2u in the Bronx, Pasteles Cristina in Queens — or at groceries like the 76-year-old Moore Street Market in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where generations of Puerto Ricans have shopped for ajicito chiles, the saw-toothed herb called culantro and these days, pre-grated masa.

A handful of its vendors, like La Union, sell pasteles year-round, but during the holidays even the market’s religious-supply shop makes them to order. In the basement, Jesus Rodriguez works double-time building handmade machines from washing-machine motors that allow semiprofessional pastel makers to grate a box of bananas at a time. And across the street at the 49-year-old Anibal Meat Market, pastel makers like Maria Garcia stop in to buy chicken and pork for the filling.

Ms. Garcia, 70, charges $25 a dozen and has been selling pasteles for 35 years. She makes most of her sales through her son, who puts up a handwritten ad at his barbershop in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.

Most years, similar scenes would be playing out across Puerto Rico, said Melissa Fuster, 37, a professor of public health nutrition at Brooklyn College who is originally from San Juan, and often writes about Puerto Rican food culture.

Though many supermarkets on the island are still empty, she said, pasteles have long been improvised with what’s at hand, resulting in versions made with only yuca, without any filling, or with rice instead of masa.

“In difficult times, one thing that defines us is that we keep positive,” Ms. Fuster said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if people found a way to make pasteles.”

Suset Laboy Perez, 36, a Puerto Rican native who runs a Brooklyn public relations firm with her sister, Maria, worries less about pasteles this year than about the thousands of Puerto Ricans leaving the island, and the resulting losses to their culture.

Still, she said, she never made pasteles herself until years after she moved to the United States, holding her own pastel-making party as a way to connect with home.

“There will be more pasteladas,” Ms. Laboy Perez predicted. “We need them now more than ever.”

I inherited both the passion and a large part of my collection from my inimitable Aunt Sue, the best library scavenger in the family. I think the first I ever received was a 1949 number called “Marcia: Private Secretary,” by the memorably named Zillah MacDonald; it dealt with government espionage and, if memory serves, the plot turned on watermarks. I’ve been hooked ever since, and now the brightly jacketed library rejects fill four shelves of my bookcase.

There are two basic categories of career romance. The more sober variety from Julian Messner’s Career Romances for Young Moderns — “Toby Law: Stenographer,” “Lee Devins: Copywriter” — are conscientious and informative, often by serious writers and containing many pages of rather mind-numbingly detailed exposition about, say, the importance of personnel (“A Flair for People”) or social work (“A Special Kind of Love”). This commentary is often delivered by an impressive older woman who visits the heroine’s high school or college, expanding her horizons.

Even the more traditionally feminine career paths are treated with seriousness. In “Patti Lewis: Home Economist,” from 1956, the heroine is forced to defend her career to a group of skeptical businessmen: “With dignity, and a trace of peppery temper, Patti Lewis explained why and how nutrition is as vital a field as nursing. Getting full nourishment out of foods — educating the public in good food habits — advising food manufacturers what Mrs. Public wants and can afford to buy — preventing waste and spoilage of food — in short, the job was to help all sorts of Americans to live healthily, economically and well.” Nurses — military, space, school, rural, E.R. — are practically their own genre, of which the protracted Cherry Ames series is merely the best-known example.

The career romances from the publishers Valentine and Avalon are more entertaining, if rather less educational. They tend to focus on more glamorous careers: beauty, fashion, acting, owning pet shops. And in novels like “Dreams to Shatter” (pottery) or “A Measure of Love” (department-store modeling) the careers are mere backdrops to lurid and implausible romances, skeletons in closets and Nancy Drew-style investigations. One, about hotel management (“Welcome to Dunecrest”), contains an especially bizarre subplot about a wealthy family’s secret son, who turns out to have been hidden due to his dwarfism, and makes a dramatic 11th-hour appearance, “his face lined with dissipation.”

No matter the publisher, there’s a certain formula to these books: Young woman comes to the city, learns a career, vanquishes a rival, is attracted to a caddish smoothie and ends up with a good guy. Sometimes, especially in those books from the ’40s, she leaves her job to get married. In other cases (see: “Author’s Agent”) the heroine and Mr. Right go into business together. Clothes, apartments and meals tend to be satisfyingly described. I can’t speak to their utility for contemporary young women; certainly, “Joan: Freelance Writer,” from 1948, would prove somewhat misleading for a young woman moving to the city, if only because Joan lives in an entire house in Gramercy Park. But as historical immersion, they’re peerless.

It would be inaccurate to describe this genre as uniformly progressive: The books are of their time, with all the prejudices and anachronisms that implies. But the range of careers described is — for those of us with a narrow view of women’s midcentury options — eye-opening. Sure, our protagonists are sometimes confronted by scandalized old-timers (“Lady Lawyer,” “Lady Architect,” and “The Vet Is a Girl!” all spring to mind) but in every single case, she triumphs in her chosen career, impressing all naysayers. And as times changed, so too did the jobs. Fascination with aviation gave way to “Polly Perry: TV Cook,” while the 1960s brought us idealistic titles like “Ann Gordon of the Peace Corps,” “A Campaign for Pam” and “The Highest Dream,” in which the main character becomes a guide at the Kennedy-era United Nations.",In Praise of the ‘Career Romance’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/books/vintage-women-careers.html

When Mr. Turner began to flee, they chased him, tackled him and held him for the police.
Mr. Turner was convicted of sexual assault of an unconscious person, sexual assault of an intoxicated person and sexual assault with intent to commit rape.
Attempts on Saturday to reach Judge Persky, who is prohibited from commenting on the appeal because it is a pending case, were unsuccessful.","Judge Aaron Persky of Santa Clara County Superior Court sentenced Mr. Turner — who was a 19-year-old freshman when the crime occurred on Jan. 18, 2015 — to six months in a county jail and three years’ probation after he was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault. Mr. Turner faced as much as 14 years in prison.

He lost his swimming scholarship to Stanford and had to register as a sex offender in Ohio, his home state.

The sentence was criticized as egregiously lenient, prompting an effort to recall Judge Persky. Mr. Turner served three months in jail and was released on Sept. 2, 2016.

“The jury heard the evidence and decisively rejected Turner’s efforts to blame the victim,” Michele Dauber, a professor of law at Stanford and the chairwoman of a committee to recall Judge Persky, said on Saturday. “The problem with this case is not that Judge Persky was unfair to Brock Turner, it’s that Judge Persky was unfair to the victim.”

The 22-year-old victim, who was not a Stanford student, was attacked after a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity. Two Stanford graduate students who were bicycling came upon the assault, according to court records. When Mr. Turner began to flee, they chased him, tackled him and held him for the police.

The victim has said she does not recall the assault. She said she was told she had been found behind a Dumpster, and learned from news reports that the witnesses discovered her attacker on top of her unconscious, partly clothed body.

Mr. Turner’s appeal takes issue with the prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci’s many references to the Dumpster during the trial, particularly her repeated use of the phrase “behind the Dumpster.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The appeal said the use of the phrase “implied an intent on the appellant’s part to shield” his activities from others and “implied moral depravity, callousness, and culpability on the appellant’s part because of the inherent connotations of filth, garbage, detritus and criminal activity frequently generally associated with Dumpsters.”

The victim and Mr. Turner were found in a three-sided structure that customarily houses a Dumpster. They were discovered on an open side, facing a darkened basketball court. The fraternity house faced the other side.

The graduate students approached from the basketball court side, meaning Mr. Turner and the victim were not obscured, the brief said.

A request for comment from Ms. Kianerci was not immediately returned on Saturday.

Mr. Turner was convicted of sexual assault of an unconscious person, sexual assault of an intoxicated person and sexual assault with intent to commit rape.

In a statement submitted to the court before his sentencing, Mr. Turner insisted that the sexual encounter was consensual, but he did admit to “imposing trauma and pain” on the victim.

At Mr. Turner’s sentencing, the victim read a lengthy statement.

“This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making,” she said in the statement. “Assault is not an accident.”

Mr. Turner’s father, Dan, was harshly criticized online after he made a statement saying that his son should not go to jail or have his life ruined for “20 minutes of action.”

A still-unresolved issue stemming from the case is the fate of Judge Persky, who sought in court to block signature-collection efforts calling for his ouster. That request was rejected on Friday by a state appellate court.

“We’re extremely pleased that the court of appeals turned down Judge Persky’s request for a stay,” Professor Dauber said. The committee she is leading has so far collected 76,000 signatures of the 90,000 needed to get on the June ballot.

Attempts on Saturday to reach Judge Persky, who is prohibited from commenting on the appeal because it is a pending case, were unsuccessful.

LaDoris Cordell, a retired Superior Court judge from Santa Clara County and an opponent of the recall effort, said in an interview on Saturday that the appellate court had denied his request for an emergency writ but that a full hearing would happen sometime next year.",Brock Turner Is Appealing His Sexual Assault Conviction,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/brock-turner-appeal.html

Stories often dwell on the gentrifying neighborhood’s property sales or the latest murder in the 40th precinct.

With coverage like that, it’s easy to forget that people live, love and grow up there.

In “Haven,” the photographer Sarah Blesener looks beyond the headlines, capturing a group of neighborhood boys coming of age. Her images defy the one-dimensional stereotype of “young boys in the Bronx.” No gang signs or bandanas, no flashing of guns, no clutched Hennessy bottles or blunts. Just kids.

Kids who cram into their mothers’ couches and text, who sit on each other’s beds like it’s their own, who spot each other a few quarters for chips and soda, who get nervous talking to their crush. They live in housing projects within walking distance of each other. Members of their family have been incarcerated, and they live in fear of being arrested themselves, as well as being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Their demeaners balance maturity and boyishness in a way those who live outside their neighborhood don’t necessarily get.

Ms. Blesener was born and raised in Minnesota and has only spent a few years in New York. One day, she was shooting a portrait of Chavi, 14, the first boy in the group she met through a friend at ICP, where she is a student. Chavi dreams of being a bachata star like another Bronx kid done good, Romeo Santos. After releasing a new single and asking Ms. Blesener for a portrait, she suggested they go up to a rooftop to get a panorama of the Bronx. Chavi was nervous, and after a few shots, asked to go back downstairs. Ms. Blesener didn’t understand why. He spelled it out for her: She can afford to get into trouble, he told her, but he can’t. “It really sucks that he has to be so aware of that at such a young age,” she said.

There are other things Chavi and his boys are aware of, too, like their neighborhood changing almost daily with expensive apartments, new cafes, restaurants and galleries. “They are all afraid of being left behind,” said Ms. Blesener, who recounted how she’d often make the walk with them down Third Avenue, and they’d stop and point out signs of gentrification: new businesses, shuttered ones, unfamiliar faces. In one photograph, they play softball in a field not far from Yankee Stadium. Behind them, a new construction project looms.

Photo

When Ms. Blesener met Chavi and his four friends as freshmen in high school, they were so shy they’d barely swear around her. Then she spent time with them, met their families and their girlfriends and they opened up. They are juniors now, experiencing their first breakups, their voices changing, and the feeling of being too cool to talk to anyone as openly as they once did.

Ms. Blesener said she plans to continue to photograph the boys until they are seniors in high school. The culmination, she hopes, will paint a different image of what it means to grow up in a neighborhood like Mott Haven.

“There’s nothing but bad statements about the place, especially when it comes to teenagers,” she said. “But these kids are really set on defying that. They don’t want to be put in those types of boxes.”

Among the issues that will need to be worked out: Under the Senate bill, tax cuts for individuals would expire at the end of 2025 to mitigate the losses in revenue, and the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act would be repealed. The House bill does not have these provisions.

The two versions also employ different methods to try to prevent multinational companies from shifting profits out of America and into lower-tax countries.

In addition, the House bill would set a new 25 percent top tax rate for profits earned by small businesses and other so-called pass-through companies, while the Senate bill would give the owners of those companies a 23 percent deduction on pass-through income, which is taxed at rates for individuals.

The House bill would eliminate the alternative minimum tax for corporations and individuals and eventually eliminate the estate tax. The Senate bill would maintain the corporate A.M.T. and trim, but not end, the individual A.M.T. and the estate tax.

Still, the bills share much of the same architecture and many core elements. Each would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Each would eliminate deductions for state and local income taxes, nearly double the standard deduction for individual filers, and reduce individual tax rates. Because of those provisions, both bills are projected to cut taxes initially for the bulk of middle-class taxpayers, yet raise them on millions of other middle-class families.

The House bill would preserve a deduction for up to $10,000 a year in state and local property taxes. The Senate bill would, too, thanks to a last-minute change that helped gain the support of Senator Susan Collins of Maine.

Mr. Trump, after insisting for weeks that the top corporate rate be cut to 20 percent, signaled on Saturday that it could wind up being a little higher — 22 percent. “It could be 22 when it comes out, but it could also be 20,” he told reporters outside the White House. “We’ll see what ultimately comes out.”

Such an increase would give Republicans extra revenue to pay for other tax cuts in the overhaul, potentially easing its path to final passage.

Lawmakers and lobbyists will battle furiously over the small details in a consensus bill, but party leaders show little worry that big issues will trip up the plan. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said early Saturday that the House would move “quickly” to a conference committee. House members are planning to return to Washington on Monday, a day earlier than planned, to vote to proceed to conference.

“Now it’s time to take the best of both the House and Senate bills, make them even stronger in a conference committee,” Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release on Saturday, “and finalize one piece of legislation that will dramatically improve the lives of Americans for generations to come.”

After the Senate vote, some ebullient Republicans seemed to hint that a conference might not even be necessary. “We’ll see,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, when asked if he thought the House might just take up the Senate’s bill.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, suggested that such a move by House Republicans was possible, but said, “That’ll be a question for House leadership.” A senior administration official, however, said on Friday night that that was not likely to happen.

If Republicans do go to conference, the House and the Senate would each need to vote again to pass the package that resulted from those negotiations, before sending the bill to Mr. Trump. If the House were to simply approve the Senate bill, it would head to Mr. Trump straight away.

Unable to stop or stall the bill, because Republicans are employing a process that allows them to bypass a legislative filibuster, Democrats were left to fume about the tax plan and the process by which it was speeding toward approval.

Democrats charged that the Senate bill had been loaded with last-minute favors for the rich and the well-connected at the expense of the middle class, and complained that the text of the bill had been released only hours before the vote, with handwritten changes scrawled in the margins. Lobbyists saw a list detailing the changes before they did, the Democrats said.

“Is this really how the Republicans are going to rewrite the tax code?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, asked in a floor speech before the vote. “Scrawled like something on the back of a napkin? Behind closed doors? With the help of K Street lobbyists? If that’s not a recipe for swindling the middle class and loosening loopholes for the wealthy, I don’t know what is.”

As a group, Democrats seemed resigned to the fact that there was little they could do to stop the tax overhaul from being enacted.

“My sense is they may have a conference in name only,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said after the vote.

But Mr. Wyden predicted that Republicans would eventually regret their victory. “The American people are going to be stunned when they see what’s really in this,” he said.","Few Hurdles Left, G.O.P.

The provision would lower rates for taxpayers simply if their businesses are organized as partnerships or other entities whose tax burdens flow to the individual. Half of that type of income goes to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to the Tax Policy Center. In total, that tax cut will cost the government about $476 billion over the coming decade.

Not all types of income would be eligible for the newly reduced rate. Short-term capital gains, dividends, interest and annuity payments, for example, are excluded. But the list of earnings that do qualify was expanded from earlier Republican proposals in the Senate.

Investments in mortgages held by real estate investment trusts would be able to take advantage of the lower pass-through rate instead of being taxed at ordinary income rates, which are higher.

Thanks to an amendment offered by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, certain income from gas and oil operators could also qualify for the new, lower rate. Industry representatives said they would have been excluded from the intended benefits that the real estate investment trusts and other publicly traded industries were getting.

“The Senate went out of its way to confirm that passive investors in these publicly traded investment vehicles get the benefit of the pass-through discount tax rate,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “This is a working definition of a tax boondoggle.”

Offshore Tax Break

A provision to give multinational companies like Pfizer, Google and Apple a tax break on the profits they have accumulated in offshore tax havens was made less generous than earlier versions of the proposal. But the companies would still bring those earnings home at rates of 7.5 to 14.5 percent — well below the existing corporate income tax rate of 35 percent and also lower than the new corporate income tax rate, which the bill would cut nearly in half to 20 percent. This break will still save the companies roughly half a trillion dollars compared with current law, according to an estimate by the Zion Research Group.

Banks Avoid a Hit

Banks and other financial institutions will still be able to avoid taxes by making payments to offshore subsidiaries. The lawmakers had initially intended to prevent the tax benefits from such actions, but the banks got a last-minute reprieve for some transactions. In calculating the companies’ tax bills, the bill excludes payments related to derivatives, a big source of income for financial institutions.

Alternative Minimum Tax Confusion

The bill extends so-called bonus depreciation — the ability to take big deductions related to certain corporate investments — at a cost of $34 billion, but pays for it by reinstating the corporate alternative minimum tax. The last-minute decision to scrap the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax left lawyers and accountants scratching their heads about the ultimate impact. Several experts said it appeared unintentional that the benefit of the tax credit for research and experimentation could effectively be lost. The provision is dear to many businesses.

“Oops,” said Mr. Looney of the Brookings Institution. “That’s an easy mistake to make on a first pass, but which you’d catch if you had more time.”

Family Leave Credit, but Not for Everyone

At least one Republican proposal floated for weeks made it into the final bill, but seemingly in a form designed to punish taxpayers in Democratic states. Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, introduced an employee credit for paid family and medical leave. But the final version doesn’t apply to employers in states where such paid leave is either required — or will soon be required — by state law, as in New York, California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. It also doesn’t apply to employees making more than $72,000 and will last only until the end of 2019.

“So in sum, we’ve got a short-term fertility incentive for lower/middle-income employees, as long as you don’t live in too blue a state,” Daniel Hemel, a professor of tax law at the University of Chicago, wrote on Twitter.

Hits for Low-Income Earners

While wealthy investors and business would receive numerous tax cuts — including eliminating the estate tax for all but a tiny sliver of the country’s wealthiest households — the Senate moved to tighten deductions for lower- and middle-income wage earners. The bill, for example, prohibits employers from rewarding employees with gift cards so that a reward of, say, $25 or $50 in the form of a gift card doesn’t escape being taxed.

At the same time, a provision to fund the I.R.S. so that it could offer advice to low-income filers was rejected in the final bill.

Although the bill expands the child tax credit by a year to 17-year-olds, that change ends at the end of 2024, a year before other individual tax cuts are scheduled to expire — so families with children born in 2008 will see that credit end when their children are still 16.

Subsidy for Private and Religious Schools

In the early morning hours on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence cast a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment to allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts for private and religious schools and some home schooling. Under current law, 529 accounts can be used only for higher education.","Tax Bill Offers Last-Minute Breaks for Developers, Banks and Oil Industry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/business/tax-bill-offers-last-minute-breaks-for-developers-banks-and-oil-industry.html

It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

And by evening, he was trying to shift attention back to Hillary Clinton. “Many people in our Country are asking what the ‘Justice’ Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and ‘acid washed’ 33,000 Emails?” he wrote, referring to email messages that Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers deemed unrelated to her government work. “No justice!”

The special counsel investigation into Russia’s interference in last year’s election has driven him to fits of anger for months, and his staff could hardly be surprised that he would vent that again. From their point of view, his first comments on Saturday at least were not aimed at investigators.

“The Flynn plea is important, too, because it shows that the cracks in the White House front that everyone suspected are real,” said David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. “And they may widen. It seems likely to deepen the sense of siege in the West Wing. That siege mentality can be crippling.”

History offers mixed lessons. Watergate obviously destroyed Richard M. Nixon’s presidency and even that of his successor, Gerald R. Ford, who was punished by voters for pardoning him. President Bill Clinton survived being impeached for lying under oath about sexual liaisons with Monica S. Lewinsky only after a Senate trial in which lawmakers opted against removing him from office.

Even a less sweeping, less threatening scandal can have a chilling effect on a White House. When Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, was indicted on a charge of lying to investigators about the leak of a C.I.A. officer’s identity, West Wing colleagues were demoralized. One later called it “the lowest point” of his White House tenure. And it led to deep tension between Mr. Cheney and President George W. Bush over whether Mr. Libby should be pardoned.

The key for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton was convincing the public that they were not distracted by the investigations but instead remained focused on doing their jobs and serving the American people. In Mr. Clinton’s case, at least, it was partially an act — while he was able to effectively manage major foreign policy issues even at the height of the impeachment debate, in private he was consumed by the investigation, raged endlessly about his tormentors and at times seemed deeply distracted.

Mr. Trump is hardly a model of political discipline, and keeping him focused has been a major preoccupation of his staff from the beginning. Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer overseeing the response to the investigation, has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to keep quiet about it, with mixed results. John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general serving as White House chief of staff, tries to keep Mr. Trump’s day filled with meetings on policy issues but has yet to tame the president’s Twitter habit.

“To be sure, an event like this can be a drain on morale, especially for those who worked with and like General Flynn,” said Shannen W. Coffin, a former counsel to Mr. Cheney. “For the rest of the White House, it’s important not to get dragged down into the Washington speculation game, and that they keep their eyes on the ball on the president’s priorities in domestic policy, judicial appointments, national security and the like.”

Mr. Coffin pointed to Mr. Kelly, who has enforced more order on the West Wing operation, if not on the president himself. “With some internal discipline, which the chief of staff has imposed, there’s no reason this should become all consuming,” he said.

Mr. Trump has options for short-circuiting the investigation that other presidents might not have contemplated in similar circumstances. Having already fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, Mr. Trump could likewise fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, or he could pardon Mr. Flynn or others swept up in the investigation. Either tack would almost surely provoke a bipartisan firestorm and, critics warned, potentially expose Mr. Trump to impeachment proceedings for obstruction of justice.

Lawmakers were quick to warn Mr. Trump away from such a course in the hours after Mr. Flynn’s plea. “I think any pardons or any type of shenanigans with this whole process would be very troublesome,” said Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, one of the Democrats considered friendliest with Mr. Trump.

Assuming the Senate and House reconcile their different versions of the tax cuts and send a final bill to the president for his signature, it will provide a burst of momentum near the end of an otherwise rocky first year for Mr. Trump. What remains unclear is whether he can keep that going. Mr. Trump and lawmakers have just days to agree on spending legislation to avert a partial government shutdown, and even if they fulfill that most basic of governmental responsibilities, there are no easy areas of agreement looming next.

The tax cuts presumably will keep the current economic surge going in the short term as markets hit records and Mr. Trump has effectively used his executive power to slash regulations to the delight of the corporate world. But on immigration, infrastructure, health care and other issues, no ready consensus exists even among Republicans, much less across the aisle, for major legislation.

Given that, many analysts expect Mr. Trump to continue his practice of instigating polarizing debates over divisive issues, like slamming kneeling National Football League players or distributing anti-Muslim videos. His advisers harbor little hope of expanding his popular support in the short term and appear mainly intent on holding his base of 35 to 40 percent of the public.

“To move forward, they are just going to have to hunker down with the lawyers and rally the base,” Mr. Greenberg said. “Unless or until this gets still worse.”","Wrenched From Scandal to Success, Trump Looks Ahead, and Over His Shoulder",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/trump-flynn-senate-vote-taxes.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

BRONTE, Sicily — Like the big, sweet onions of Vidalia, Ga., the tiny dusky lentils from Le Puy in France, and prosciutto from the area around Parma, Italy, there’s something so special about the pistachios grown here in the foothills of Mount Etna in eastern Sicily that they have been granted government protection.

Usually, chefs in the United States simply call them Sicilian, said Fortunato Nicotra, the executive chef at Felidia in New York; he thinks it’s because the term Bronte takes too much explaining. But he scatters Bronte pistachios on a beet salad, adds them to a vinaigrette for veal, and relies on them for desserts. “They’re very fresh and sweet,” he said.

Assuming the Senate and House reconcile their different versions of the tax cuts and send a final bill to the president for his signature, it will provide a burst of momentum near the end of an otherwise rocky first year for Mr. Trump. What remains unclear is whether he can keep that going. Mr. Trump and lawmakers have just days to agree on spending legislation to avert a partial government shutdown, and even if they fulfill that most basic of governmental responsibilities, there are no easy areas of agreement looming next.

The tax cuts presumably will keep the current economic surge going in the short term as markets hit records and Mr. Trump has effectively used his executive power to slash regulations to the delight of the corporate world. But on immigration, infrastructure, health care and other issues, no ready consensus exists even among Republicans, much less across the aisle, for major legislation.

Given that, many analysts expect Mr. Trump to continue his practice of instigating polarizing debates over divisive issues, like slamming kneeling National Football League players or distributing anti-Muslim videos. His advisers harbor little hope of expanding his popular support in the short term and appear mainly intent on holding his base of 35 to 40 percent of the public.

“To move forward, they are just going to have to hunker down with the lawyers and rally the base,” Mr. Greenberg said. “Unless or until this gets still worse.”","Wrenched From Scandal to Success, Trump Looks Ahead, and Over His Shoulder",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/trump-flynn-senate-vote-taxes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

House Republicans showed their colors when they first blocked passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Plan, despite the urgent pleas of their own president, George W. Bush, and the speaker of the House, John Boehner. The seeds of a (largely phony) populist reaction were planted.

Second, there was the “Obama effect.” When Mr. Bush became president, Democrats worked with him to enact sweeping education reform early on and provided the key votes to pass his top priority, tax cuts. With President Barack Obama, it was different. While many argued that the problem was that Mr. Obama failed to schmooze enough with Republicans in Congress, we saw a deliberate Republican strategy to oppose all of his initiatives and frame his attempts to compromise as weak or inauthentic. The Senate under the majority leader Mitch McConnell weaponized the filibuster to obstruct legislation, block judges and upend the policy process. The Obama effect had an ominous twist, an undercurrent of racism that was itself embodied in the “birther” movement led by Donald Trump.

House leaders continued to inflame the populist anger of their base to win enormous midterm victories in 2010 and 2014. They repeatedly promised the impossible under divided party government: that if they won, Mr. Obama would be forced to his knees, his policies obliterated and government as we knew it demolished. Their subsequent failures to do so spurred even more rage, this time directed at establishment Republican leaders. But most pundits still clung to the belief that pragmatism would win out and Republicans would nominate an establishment insider in 2016.

Third, we have seen the impact of significant changes in the news media, which had a far greater importance on the right than on the left. The development of the modern conservative media echo chamber began with the rise of Rush Limbaugh and talk radio in the late 1980s and ramped up with the birth of Fox News. Matt Drudge, his protégé Andrew Breitbart and Breitbart’s successor Steve Bannon leveraged the power of the internet to espouse their far-right views. And with the advent of social media, we saw the emergence of a radical “alt-right” media ecosystem able to create its own “facts” and build an audience around hostility to the establishment, anti-immigration sentiment and racial resentment. Nothing even close to comparable exists on the left.

Mr. Trump’s election and behavior during his first 10 months in office represent not a break with the past but an extreme acceleration of a process that was long underway in conservative politics. The Republican Party is now rationalizing and enabling Mr. Trump’s autocratic, kleptocratic, dangerous and downright embarrassing behavior in hopes of salvaging key elements of its ideological agenda: cutting taxes for the wealthy (as part of possibly the worst tax bill in American history), hobbling the regulatory regime, gutting core government functions and repealing Obamacare without any reasonable plan to replace it.

This is a far cry from the aspirations of Republican presidential giants like Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, as well as legions of former Republican senators and representatives who identified critical roles for government and worked tirelessly to make them succeed. It’s an agenda bereft of any serious efforts to remedy the problems that trouble vast segments of the American public, including the disaffected voters who flocked to Mr. Trump.

The failure of Republican members of Congress to resist the anti-democratic behavior of President Trump — including holding not a single hearing on his and his team’s kleptocracy — is cringe-worthy. A few Republican senators have spoken up, but occasional words have not been matched by any meaningful deeds. Only conservative intellectuals have acknowledged the bankruptcy of the Republican Party.

We have never suggested that Democrats are angels and Republicans devils. Parties exist to win elections and organize government, and they are shaped by the interests, ideas and donors that constitute their coalitions. Neither party is immune from a pull to the extreme.

But the imbalance today is striking, and frightening.

Two weeks later, the first explosive report about Harvey Weinstein was published, and before long colleges found themselves confronting the problem anew.

Stanford University said it was reviewing allegations against Franco Moretti, a professor emeritus, after a blog post by a former graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.

“He was cool. He was hip,” Kimberly Latta, a psychotherapist in Pittsburgh, wrote last month in a post titled “What Happened at Berkeley in 1985.”

“I was 25 and very naïve.”

She accused Mr. Moretti, then a visiting professor in comparative literature, of raping her when she was a graduate student — allegations he has denied.

“I was just inspired by all the women coming forward about Harvey Weinstein,” Ms. Latta said in an interview, explaining why she had decided to go public. “People are believing these women. Maybe they’ll believe me, too.”

In an email, Mr. Moretti, who is now in Europe, said that the encounter was consensual and that he was “horrified by the allegations.”

At the University of Virginia, three former students filed complaints last month against John Casey, a writing professor who won the 1989 National Book Award for his novel “Spartina.”

One student, Emma Eisenberg, who received her master’s in creative writing in 2014, claimed that Mr. Casey repeatedly touched her and other female students on their “shoulders, buttocks and lower backs and made sexual and gender-based comments,” according to a university document.

In an email, Ms. Eisenberg explained why she was coming forward now.

“In my gut I knew there was something wrong about those experiences, but it was so openly talked about within the program that I figured I was overreacting,” she said. “Seeing this recent flood of women coming forward confirmed what I had always known — his behavior was problematic and inappropriate.”

The university said it was investigating the complaints, and Mr. Casey, who was on sabbatical this semester, has been barred from teaching in the spring. In an email, Mr. Casey said it “would be premature and possibly improper to discuss a matter that has scarcely begun.”

At the University of Southern California, officials said they had received an “uptick” in complaints since the first Weinstein reports, many of them describing a comparable dynamic: a man who is powerful in his field, mistreating younger women who depend on him for career advancement. Some of the reports named professors long gone from the university, while others accused men still teaching there.

In a letter to the campus on Oct. 29, the provost, Michael Quick, announced he was convening a series of forums and task forces. “There is no place on our campuses, or in our society, for abuse of power,” it said.

And in Atlanta, the issue is gripping two campuses, and exposed a deep fissure between schools closely linked by history and geography.



Neither Spelman nor Morehouse would disclose how many complaints it has received, and in interviews, Spelman students and professors said they did not believe sexual assault was any more common there than elsewhere.

But most said they believed the colleges had not been taking the issue seriously enough. Now their pent-up frustration has burst into the open during a national moment of reckoning.

“I don’t believe our students would be doing what they’re doing if things like this hadn’t been happening nationally,” said Beverly Guy-Sheftall, a women’s studies professor who was one of more than 70 Spelman professors who signed an open letter supporting students who said they had been assaulted.

In a three-minute speech on Nov. 9, the day the graffiti was found on the King chapel, Harold Martin Jr., the interim president of Morehouse, said there was “clearly a belief that there is a population that does not feel heard.”

“We will do the work,” he said, encouraging victims to come forward. (Almost all of the names on Twitter had been posted anonymously.) “Nobody has come by my office, but I hope you will.”

The issue was particularly painful for Spelman students, who spoke of a shared legacy with Morehouse that gave them great pride and, they said, could be perversely discouraging victims from coming forward or assailants from being punished.

The institutions were founded more than 130 years ago, when black students were all but banned from most American colleges. Their students have included some of the most prominent figures in African-American history, including King; the novelist Alice Walker; Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children’s Defense Fund; and the filmmaker Spike Lee.

Spelman and Morehouse students also have deep emotional connections. A Spelman freshman often pairs up with a Morehouse freshman as “sister” and “brother” who are encouraged to support each other during their college careers. Many Spelman women have traditionally aspired to marry Morehouse men, and vice versa, matches that are regularly celebrated on Facebook, producing “SpelHouse” babies.

The students are also steeped in African-American history, and many Spelman women said they felt a responsibility to protect black men from negative stereotypes.

“Having your brother’s back or your sister’s back, that’s something that’s said,” said Euphoria Davis, a 21-year-old senior. “I’ve had someone tell me to my face that I’m tarnishing the reputation of Morehouse by speaking out.”

Ms. Davis said she was naïve and had never done more than kiss a man when she arrived from the Philadelphia suburbs in 2014. During her first semester, at a warehouse party off-campus, she said, a Morehouse student asked her to dance. When she declined, she said, he grabbed her and pulled her outside the building, assisted by other men.

She said she was too intoxicated to defend herself while the men pushed her against a wall and took turns raping her.

After struggling emotionally throughout the year, she found solace in telling her story to others and speaking out on behalf of sexual assault victims, she said. When she was contacted by Morehouse’s Title IX office, which handles sexual-misconduct complaints and had heard about her allegations, she declined to pursue a claim.

She was intimidated, she said, by a competitive campus culture where reputation is paramount. She and other students described a fierce social hierarchy that existed among the two schools — which have only about 2,000 students each — where one false step can cause a person to be ostracized.

“I’m not going to get the outcome that I want from this,” she recalled thinking. “So I’m not going to go through the stress of having my whole life exposed to have them just walk away.”

Another senior, Evalyne Neely-Savitt, said that when she arrived for her freshman year, she was hoping to become part of another mythic Spelman-Morehouse power couple.

Instead of her idealized vision, one of her first encounters with Morehouse men was at a fraternity party where one threw her over his shoulder, placed his head between her legs and simulated oral sex while squeezing her thighs and bottom.

The crowd cheered and afterward, people around her congratulated her for capturing the student’s attention. So she felt she would not be supported for speaking out out against what she considered an assault.

“I feel like I wouldn’t have been heard,” she said.

Students also described practical barriers to adjudicating sexual assault. The porous boundaries that allow students to mill back and forth between the two campuses to study and socialize are not mirrored in the way that the schools are governed. Numerous Spelman women said that because complaints against Morehouse men were investigated by Morehouse, they did not expect fair treatment.

In an email, a Spelman spokeswoman, Joyce E. Davis, said the college had expanded its Title IX office in the last two years and reached out to women to encourage them to report complaints. “Spelman takes every reported incident extremely seriously,” she said.

She added, however, that the college is “not permitted to sanction students from other educational institutions.”

At Morehouse, reaction to the campaign was mixed. Isaiah Smalls, the editor of The Maroon Tiger, the campus newspaper, said he planned an entire issue on sexual assault. “I believe that as a campus, we’re not as educated as we should be,” he said.

But an angry backlash emerged from some on the campus, who called the public accusations reckless and said that at least some were untrue.

“I was devastated,” said one of the students named on Twitter. “I felt the energy that I had gained up to that point being drained out of me.”

The student, who asked that his name not be published, said he had sex with a Spelman student during his first semester after receiving her consent. She later accused him of assault.

The allegations triggered a yearlong investigation, which, according to a Morehouse document, was ultimately decided in his favor. But by the time it was resolved, the student said, his grades had dropped, he had struggled to sleep because of anxiety, and he lost some scholarship money after being temporarily barred from playing sports.

In his speech, Mr. Martin, the Morehouse interim president, said that anyone who committed sexual violence or harassment would be held accountable. He also cautioned against “jumping to judgment” about students who were accused.

He ended with an admonition. “It’s also going to be the last time that anybody defaces the chapel on our campus,” he said. “But we will do the work on this important issue. Is that clear?”

He was backing her, he said, because of her erudition — she has a law degree from Stanford — and her expertise regarding homelessness and affordable housing. But he did care about her truthfulness and wanted her assurance that her critics were off base. She gave that to him.

She gave it to me, too, and said that during her campaign, she in fact shied away from talk about sexual orientation. When I asked her what the new Council’s first order of business should be, she mentioned making it easier for people at the airport to summon Uber or Lyft.

In general the City Council race included little talk about identity politics. Middleton told me that she was seldom asked about being a transgender woman but routinely fielded questions about downtown development and the city’s budget, subjects she knew well because of her extensive involvement in civic organizations. High on her wish list for the city is six more police officers and four more firefighters. That was among her campaign promises.

I asked the police chief, Bryan Reyes, about her victory. He was jubilant. “I just believe — I really believe — in her,” he said. “I’m a straight male. I have no problem doing photo ops, giving her hugs, because of the person she is, what she represents, her work ethic, her character.”

When she and I had lunch, servers and others rushed over to congratulate her. “Do we refer to you as ‘City Councilwoman’ or just plain Lisa?” asked one of the restaurant’s owners, John Paschal.

“Her Exalted,” Middleton suggested, and they both laughed. Then she went back to bending my ear about spurring entrepreneurship in Palm Springs.

She sees the city, which has a population of just under 50,000 people, as a beacon of inclusion. But she also sees it as an example of how Americans “have been sorting ourselves,” with liberals and conservatives in separate enclaves. (The new Council is entirely Democratic.) And she has mixed feelings about that. “We get our information from different newspapers,” she said. “We live in different communities. We’re becoming not just polarized but isolated.”

Roberts echoed that over dinner at that tropical-themed restaurant with his fellow councilman Kors, 56, a lawyer and longtime gay rights advocate. “Isn’t our goal not to be separated out?” he said. He confessed to some worry that after the election, “The straight community might wake up and say, ‘Do we matter?’ ”","It’s a Gay, Gay, Gay Government",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/opinion/palm-springs-gay-government.html

The wave of accusations has also led to demands that society recognize and repair the harm of sexual misconduct.
Women are often told to grow a “thicker skin” and become less sensitive to harassment.
People worry that we are sliding down a slippery slope to neo-puritanism, or in the throes of a witch hunt for sexual impropriety.
Opposing sexual assault became a way to call Mr. Trump unfit for office, and so it fit within the familiar context of partisan rivalry.","Slippery slopes and consequences

Until recently, all of those accused, no matter the severity of their offenses, faced the same consequences: generally none. Protected by their power and authority, they kept their careers and reputations intact.

As that begins to change, some worry that we might bungle the job. “Taking harassment seriously also requires making serious distinctions,” Jonah Goldberg, a conservative columnist, wrote recently for The Los Angeles Times. “And yet Franken’s name is routinely listed alongside Moore’s and Weinstein’s.”

Masha Gessen, writing in The New Yorker, worried we may be on the verge of a “sex panic.”

Jane Curtin, a comedian who is a friend and former colleague of Mr. Franken’s, compared the current atmosphere to McCarthyism. “It’s just like the red menace,” she said in an interview with The Times. “You don’t know who’s going to be next.”

Many of those accused have lost their jobs, but for the most part, they are not facing legal consequences. Yet principles borrowed from criminal law can help us analyze whether our response to their actions is just and fair.

Criminal punishment tends to rest on two broad principles: the seriousness of the wrongdoing, and the perpetrator’s intent in committing the crime.

Viewed through that lens, the accusations against Mr. Weinstein, which include rape, and Mr. Moore, who is accused of molesting teenage girls, are clearer-cut cases for punishment than those against, say, Louis C.K., who masturbated in front of adult women but did not touch them.

It’s also important that courts do not consider only the moment of the crime itself in determining punishment. Our system also punishes defendants who threaten witnesses or obstruct justice, as well as others who help them do so. Here again, the accusations against Mr. Weinstein are especially extreme. According to a report by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker, he hired ex-Israeli intelligence agents to intimidate victims and journalists into silence.

Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, two of the women who have accused Louis C.K. of misconduct, have said they stayed silent for years in part because of pressure from Dave Becky, Louis C.K.’s manager. Mr. Becky has denied threatening them. But the women have said they feared that speaking would bring retribution.

Accountability for harm

The question of punishment is merely one factor in considering these cases. The wave of accusations has also led to demands that society recognize and repair the harm of sexual misconduct.

Caroline Framke, a culture critic for Vox, called for an accounting of the “graveyard of potential cut short by careless cruelty.”

The principles of civil law, which are intended to make victims whole and ensure that no one profits from wrongdoing, can offer useful guidance about what is fair, and what is necessary.

A central principle is that the person at fault, not the victim, should bear the cost of the harms of wrongdoing. In law school, budding attorneys learn the “eggshell plaintiff” rule, which says that defendants are responsible for all of the harm they cause, even if the injuries were made more extreme because, say, the victim’s skull was as thin as an eggshell. Otherwise, the reasoning goes, the costs will fall on the victims — a more unfair outcome than holding perpetrators responsible for unexpectedly severe damages.

It is now becoming clear that there is not a one-to-one correlation between the objective egregiousness of sexual misconduct and the damage it can cause.

Louis C.K.’s actions may have been less extreme than Mr. Weinstein’s. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have said they felt they could no longer work on projects involving him or his manager — a category that grew to include a large chunk of the comedy industry as Louis C.K.’s career took off.

And the Emmy-award-winning writer Kater Gordon told The Information that when Matthew Weiner, her boss on the show “Mad Men,” told her that he “deserved to see her naked,” he undermined her confidence and ambition. (Mr. Weiner has said that he does not remember making that comment, and would not speak that way to a colleague.)

Held up next to the allegations against Mr. Weinstein or Mr. Moore, those words may seem like a misdemeanor. But the harm was nevertheless severe, Ms. Gordon says, because she left the television industry, abandoning a promising career.

Women are often told to grow a “thicker skin” and become less sensitive to harassment. But the eggshell plaintiff rule suggests a different conclusion: that the harassers should bear the costs of the harm they impose, even on “thin-skinned” victims.

We must also consider harms that go beyond the immediate victims. Less diverse workplaces offer women fewer opportunities to find mentorship and achieve success; research suggests such workplaces are also less profitable.

Holding particular harassers responsible for harms suffered by an entire industry or gender is difficult; there are too many contributing factors for it to be easy to apportion blame. Collective harm may be more suited to government- or society-level responses. But again, the harm is there. The question is who ought to bear the cost.

Why it’s hard to think through these accusations

As more men are tarred as bad actors, and once-cherished public figures become pariahs, imposing responsibility can feel uncomfortable, even alarming.

People worry that we are sliding down a slippery slope to neo-puritanism, or in the throes of a witch hunt for sexual impropriety. Perhaps it will turn out that we are. But social science research suggests that this discomfort is a natural consequence of shifting social norms, not necessarily a sign that the changes are going too far.

Humans are wired to conform to group judgments. Dan Kahan, a professor at Yale Law School, argued in an influential paper that we rely more on our peers’ opinions than on actual laws to determine what behavior is right or wrong.

In the famous “conformity study” by the researcher Solomon Asch, a majority of participants chose to select a clearly incorrect answer to a question rather than defy the group and cease being a peer in good standing.

Partisanship was a crucial element in the issue of sexual assault during the 2016 presidential campaign, when Donald J. Trump was heard on tape boasting about grabbing women’s genitals. The ensuing public debate led many women to discuss their experiences for the first time.

That was a shift away from the previous rules, in which victims stayed silent. But the partisan aspect of the episode meant that the new conversation about assault was still a form of group morality and a way to conform to group judgments. Opposing sexual assault became a way to call Mr. Trump unfit for office, and so it fit within the familiar context of partisan rivalry.

But the more recent accusations — affecting Democrats as well as Republicans — have scrambled that partisan logic and made such group moral decision-making more difficult.

Meanwhile, the old norms of gender roles and hierarchies have not disappeared, and may conflict with new demands for accountability. There is no safe harbor of conformity to be had.

It would be convenient if doing the right thing were easy. But bringing long-hidden harms to the surface cannot help disturbing the status quo. Accounting for years of wrongdoing is costly, and dismantling hierarchies that fostered harm can lead, in the short term, to chaos. Now society must decide how many of those costs it is willing to bear.",How Should We Respond to Sexual Harassment?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/upshot/sexual-harassment-response-legal-system-guidelines.html

There’s no magic formula for getting into a selective college, but over a decade covering admissions for The Chronicle of Higher Education, I’ve picked up a thing or two. These takeaways, based on hundreds of interviews with admissions deans over the years, may help you navigate the process.

Admissions decisions aren’t all about you.

When colleges choose applicants, they’re juggling competing goals, like increasing diversity and bringing in more revenue. Admissions officers aren’t looking for students who fit just one description — say, those who’ve earned all A’s or won the most awards. So don’t take rejection personally.

Grades and test scores still carry the most weight.

Colleges often say they want to get to know the real you, but that’s probably true only if your academic accomplishments (and the rigor of courses you’ve taken) pass muster.

You’re more than a number.

After colleges identify a big batch of students with outstanding credentials, differences among them become more important, admissions deans say. Among some of the attributes they tell me they would like to see evidence of (in essays, extracurricular activities, recommendations) are: leadership, risk taking, emotional intelligence, fire for learning, critical thinking, curiosity, empathy, optimism, grit, perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles.

Express your authentic self.

Overwhelmed by slick, boastful essays, colleges are eager for what they call “authentic” glimpses of applicants — their experiences, passions and goals. Some deans believe they’ll get deeper insight through alternative formats like videos, pictures, audio files or documents (an Advanced Placement English paper, maybe). A handful of prestigious schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago, Pomona College, Reed College and the University of Rochester, recently introduced this option. As with essays, too much polish is no good, deans say, so you might think twice about hiring a professional videographer. At Yale, about 400 applicants (out of nearly 33,000) for this year’s freshman class sent in something in an alternative format. In at least one case, the submission — a video showing leadership and impact on others — was, the dean told me, a “difference maker.”",10 Things to Know About Getting Into Your Dream College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/admissions-tips-on-getting-into-dream-college.html

Didn’t this apartment, with its dramatic dark-gray cabinetry and vivid upholstery, look very much like her own former home — the five-story Park Slope, Brooklyn, brownstone that, after appearing in a 2008 issue of Domino magazine, was among the most-pinned interiors on all of Pinterest? Cameron admitted to the homage immediately. “She was like, ‘Yes! It was totally taken from your living room,’ ” Lyons recalls. “She had the yellow couches, the whole thing.”

From her slicked-back ponytail and chunky eyeglasses to her love of acid-bright hues (a lemon blazer here, an electric orange lipstick there), Lyons’s style has been copied down to its smallest detail. That’s due in part to her innate approachability — her skill at mixing unexpected elements to achieve a look that feels fanciful if not quite fancy — but also to an act of brilliant corporate image-making: Throughout her eight years as president and decade as creative director of J.Crew, the company made her singular aesthetic achievable, convincing its customers that they, too, could mix coral coats with torn jeans and sequined heels.

This past April, the 49-year-old Lyons departed the company after 27 years. She’d started as an assistant men’s wear designer right out of college, but by 2014, profits had tumbled, and J.Crew had become a symbol of brick-and-mortar retail’s global decline. Faced with the first stretch of aimlessness in her adult life, she spent three months jumping “from the pool to the couch to the kitchen to the pool” at her house upstate in Berryville, N.Y. — while refusing to jump into any decisions about her next steps. “It took me the summer to decompress and think about what’s important to me,” Lyons says. “Is it making big shifts, or doing something small?” While there have been offers, she says, she hasn’t seriously entertained any of them yet, nor is she planning to any time soon.

Instead, Lyons has been spending her days in her newly redesigned apartment, a 3,500-square-foot loft on the fourth floor of a 19th-century cast-iron building in SoHo. Much has happened in Lyons’s world, not just professionally, in the six years since she sold the Brooklyn townhouse that made zebra-hide rugs a more popular (and populist) necessity than they might have previously been: Her 2011 divorce from artist-turned-restaurateur Vincent Mazeau was followed by a relationship with Courtney Crangi — co-founder, with her brother Philip, of the N.Y.C.-based jewelry line Giles & Brother — that has since come to an end.

After purchasing her apartment in 2012, Lyons spent a year in a rental down the street, the better to oversee every aspect of the loft’s transformation from a drab artist’s studio, with yellowing floors and featureless walls, into a heavily accessorized, sumptuously textured home that might feel familiar to her many acolytes. For Lyons, the effort that went into pulling off that specific mix was as satisfying as the result — “the real goal was having it look like something you’ve never seen before,” she says.

WALKING OFF THE elevator into Lyons’s apartment, one is greeted by a living area that blends eclectic modernism (Monstera deliciosa leaves, leopard-print poufs) with a bit of Old World Paris (antiqued mirrors, toile-printed panels): It’s feminine without being sweet, busy but not forced. The room is also gloriously sunny, thanks to five eight-foot-high, west-facing windows.

On display throughout is Lyons’s signature playfulness, from the giant, gold-foil numeral 10 left over from her son Beckett’s birthday, to the framed geometric prints by Fred Sandback leaning casually against the fireplace, to the room’s showpiece: an original drawing by her favorite artist, Cy Twombly, announcing a 1979 show of his work at Yvon Lambert’s Paris gallery. Still, interiors buffs who memorized every nuance of her Park Slope house will detect a deeper richness, as if here, Lyons has permitted herself to unfurl into the tactile luxury that comes with real achievement. The cozy softness of the room’s milky gray walls, the pale oak herringbone parquet floors — after much deliberation, left unsealed to develop a patina — the verdigris side table that contrasts against a massive couch in what she calls a “truly faded-out persimmon” pink: All speak to Lyons’s idiosyncratic genius for color and texture, but also to her exacting and precise eye, one trained over years superintending dozens of store openings and developing an understanding for how a space is meant to spotlight only the most central elements.",Jenna Lyons’s Space of Her Own,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/t-magazine/jenna-lyons-home-soho.html

Earlier studies had given scientists hints that the scallop eye was weirdly complex. Each has a lens, a pair of retinas, and a mirror-like structure at the back. Scientists suspected that light passed through the lenses and the retinas, which are mostly transparent, bounced off the mirror, and struck the retinas on the return.

But no one knew how the mirror works, or why scallops needed two retinas when other animals need only one.

Benjamin A. Palmer, a postdoctoral researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and his colleagues recently used a powerful new tool known as a cryo-electron microscope to look at scallop eyes.

He and his colleagues froze slices of the eyes, making it possible to inspect the tissue down to its fine molecular details. (Last month, three pioneers of cryo-electron microscopy won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.)

Researchers have long known that the mirror in a scallop eye is made from a molecule called guanine. It’s best known as one of the main ingredients of DNA, but in some animals guanine is packed into crystals that reflect light.

Some fish have a silvery tint to their scales thanks to guanine crystals. Chameleons use guanine crystals to help them change the color of their skin. But no one knew how guanine helped scallops to see.

Using cryo-electron microscopes, Dr. Palmer and his colleagues discovered that scallops make a kind of guanine crystal never seen before in nature: a flat square. “We were amazed,” he said. “We knew this would be something cool.”

The researchers found that the mirrors are made of twenty to thirty layers of guanine, each containing millions of squares that fit together snugly like tiles on a wall.

“To see that square tiling is completely new,” said Daniel I. Speiser, a visual ecologist at the University of South Carolina who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Palmer and his colleagues took X-rays of the scallop eyes to determine that these layers form a flat-bottomed bowl. The scientists created a computer model of the entire eye based on these findings, allowing them to trace the paths that light took as it bounced off the mirror.

Paradoxically, the guanine squares don’t reflect light on their own — they’re transparent. But their arrangement turns them into a collective mirror.

The layers of tiles are separated by thin layers of fluid, and as a ray of light passes through them, it gets bent further and further from its original direction. Eventually the light gets turned completely around, heading back toward the front of the eye.

This arrangement is well suited for underwater vision, the researchers found, because it is better at bouncing back some colors of light than others. “You have a mirror that basically reflects a hundred percent of the blue light it receives,” Dr. Palmer said. “It makes a lot of sense that it reflects all the light it has in its environment.”

The model created by Dr. Palmer and his colleagues may also solve the mystery of the two retinas. The researchers found that each retina receives sharply focused light from different parts of the animal’s field of view.

One retina can create a sharp image of what’s right in front of the eye. The other retina gives a better view of the periphery.

Dr. Palmer speculated that scallops might use each retina to face a different challenge in their lives.

The retina that sees the central field of view might allow scallops to quickly recognize oncoming predators, allowing them to beat a hasty retreat by swimming away.

Scallops may pay attention to their peripheral vision instead when they’re searching for a spot on the sea floor where they can settle down to feed.

Each eye, the new study demonstrates, is exquisitely complex. What’s more, the hundreds of eyes on a scallop all deliver signals to a single cluster of neurons, which may combine that information to create a rich picture of the outside world.

To Dr. Speiser, it all seems like overkill. Why does a fairly ordinary bivalve need Star Wars vision technology? “It’s still a puzzle why they see so well,” he said.

Dr. Palmer said that scallop eyes may provide inspirations for new inventions. There’s certainly precedent: NASA has built X-ray detectors to study black holes that mimic lobster eyes. Perhaps an artificial scallop eye could take pictures in dim seawater.

But Dr. Palmer is more excited by the prospect of creating materials that are new to engineering. His study shows that scallops have evolved a mastery over forming crystals, guiding them into shapes that researchers didn’t think possible.

At this point, no one has any idea yet how they do it. “Understanding that could open the door to much bigger things than just making a single device,” Dr. Palmer said.",The Scallop Sees With Space-Age Eyes — Hundreds of Them,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/science/scallops-eyes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It was just after the French art fair FIAC, and with his deadline looming, Taylor was mining the internet on his iPhone in search of inspiration: photographs of Jay-Z, photographs of Jay-Z and Beyoncé and lyrics from the rapper’s music.

“I could have had someone dusting dirt off his shoulder,” Taylor told T in his studio in downtown Los Angeles, balancing a growing column of ash at the end of his cigarette. But another more recent lyric kept resurfacing in his mind: “I’m not black, I’m O.J.,” a reference to an alleged quote from O.J. Simpson’s murder trial. Simpson was saying, as the story goes, that through fame and fortune he had managed to distance himself from the issues plaguing black men in America: poverty, police brutality, incarceration.

“You can be LeBron and you’re still dealing with that,” says Taylor, who has become a star player in the art world for his empathetic portraits — of neighbors, fellow artists and Drake included — rendered in dense blocks of color. (Throughout our interview, he’s had to pause intermittently to instruct art handlers to take certain paintings back to his gallery, Blum & Poe, to be sent to Art Basel Miami Beach.)

“Do we have similar experiences?” he asks. “Hell yeah. C’mon. I’m black. That’s all you got to say.”

Taylor produced a second painting for the December issue that tackles these themes head-on: Titled “Go Next Door and Ask Michelle’s Momma Mrs Robinson If I Can Borrow 20 Dollars Til Next Week?” the work, Taylor says, references Michelle Obama’s mother, Marian Shields Robinson. A figure wearing a Colin Kaepernick jersey peers through a fence onto the former homes of two of the most powerful black men in America: the White House and the Marcy projects, the Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn public housing complex where Jay-Z grew up. Through the trees in the foreground, there are men boarding a bus to the county sheriff’s department, overseen by a menacing black horse.

“Artists sometimes, we have to be the ones to speak out, and we talk about what we know,” Taylor says. “Let’s be real: There’s a re-enslavement of black people on and off the court. Every successful black person has 18 members of his family living in the projects, and we all know someone who’s in the system.”

As for his portrait of Jay-Z, Taylor never found the right reference photo — and opted instead to paint from memory. The end result is “I Am a Man,” a close-up of the rapper and music mogul in a dark suit and a bright blue tie.

T Magazine publishes 11 times a year, and the theme of each issue usually guides the content (at least to some degree): The Women’s Fashion issue is about women’s fashion; the Design issue is about design; the Travel issue is about … well, you get the idea.

But the Holiday issue — our last of the year — is more open to interpretation. Historically, this issue is defined by its cover subject, a person whom the staff believes has in some way defined the national cultural conversation over the past 12 months. This year, Jay-Z was our first choice. Not only is there the fact of his most recent album, the confessional, searching “4:44” (nominated last week for eight Grammys), but there is the entire arc of his professional life: Other musicians have become moguls, of course, but few have done so as commandingly as he has. Other musicians have created great albums, but few have done so for as many years, and with as much consistency, as he has.

By July, we’d confirmed Jay-Z’s participation, and then came the next challenge: Who would interview him? If you’re Jay-Z, you’ve talked to everyone: music critics, fellow musicians, novelists and even presidents. Who could bring to this conversation the just-right blend of open-mindedness, curiosity and rigor?

And then I realized that the perfect person was closer than I’d thought: Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times. I knew he was a great journalist — he had, after all, spent many years as an investigative reporter. And I had experienced firsthand his ability to be incisive while remaining compassionate, while he was interviewing me for my job as editor of T. Our entertainment director, Lauren Tabach-Bank, proposed the idea to Jay-Z’s people, who immediately agreed. Then, with a little help from Sam Dolnick, an assistant masthead editor, we presented the idea to Mr. Baquet — who generously agreed as well.

It was a perfect pairing. But it occurred to all of us that we’d given ourselves the feat of trying to align the schedules of two of the busiest men in New York City. It took many conversations to set a date: Sept. 29. Besides impossible calendars, another thing Mr. Baquet and Jay-Z have in common is their love of African-American contemporary art. So when we decided to feature a portrait on the cover, I knew I wanted to commission an African-American artist to make it. I always tell T’s editors that I want the artists and writers who shoot, paint or profile our subjects to feel somehow emotionally connected to the people they’re depicting. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we, say, reflexively partner a black writer with a black subject. But some of Jay-Z’s most profound and revelatory songs are in fact about being black in America, and I wanted a visual artist who explored similar ideas in his or her work. Our in-house art expert, the staff editor M.H. Miller, suggested a few artists, including Henry Taylor, who was everyone’s first choice, and our photo director, Nadia Vellam, and creative director, Patrick Li, immediately got to work securing his participation.

Then, a few weeks before the interview was to happen, I went down to Mr. Baquet’s office to discuss his upcoming meeting with Jay-Z. An exceptional reporter is not unlike a therapist: His job is not to judge or assume, but rather to make the subject speak some truth about himself that he might not ever have considered. Mr. Baquet had enough questions to keep Jay-Z talking for an entire day — What is it like to be in a marriage that is also a source of artistic inspiration? As a black artist, did he feel he had a responsibility to his community, and what did that even mean, and was it even fair? What, if anything, does an artist owe his society? — but the ones that moved me the most were those that revealed a facet of Mr. Baquet’s own life, even as they revealed something similar in Jay-Z’s. Both have reached the top of realms — media; business — that are still overwhelmingly dominated by white men. Both are living in very different circumstances from the ones imagined for them as children. Their discussion, therefore, was as much an exchange between peers as an interview. There’s an intimacy to their talk that feels natural and true, a mutual respect evident in how closely and attentively you can see each listening to the other.",When Jay-Z Met Our Top Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/insider/jay-z-dean-baquet-hanya-yanagihara.html

At this point, no one has any idea yet how they do it. “Understanding that could open the door to much bigger things than just making a single device,” Dr. Palmer said.",The Scallop Sees With Space-Age Eyes — Hundreds of Them,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/science/scallops-eyes.html

Generation Grumpy: Why You May Be Unhappy if You’re Around 50 The generation of people born 1962 to 1971, now in what are typically peak earning years, are finding they are not doing as well as they might have expected.

As people get older, they tend to become more at peace with their finances, survey research shows. But not the current crop of middle-aged Americans.

Let’s call them the Grumpy Middle.

They are unhappier than previous generations. And they’ve been this way for years.

Typically, people 45 to 54 are more likely than others to say they are “pretty well satisfied” with their financial situation, according to the University of Chicago’s General Social Survey. Then the generation born between 1962 and 1971 started to reach their current age range — and bring their longstanding economic dissatisfaction with them.

By 2016, as middle-aged Americans, they were 12 percent less likely to say they were satisfied financially, and 18 percent more likely to say they were unhappy. (Respondents can also give a neutral answer.)

Following the Grumpy Middle over time in the survey reveals that they have been less happy than other respondents as far back as the early 1990s, when most of them were in their 20s.

Americans in their 20s and 30s have always expressed a higher degree of anxiety, but this is the first time in the survey that the dissatisfaction has crept so far up into middle age. The General Social Survey does not dig deeper on this and ask why. And other variables that touch on personal happiness don’t suggest people born between these years are more unhappy over all.

But when it comes to money, a look at economic data begins to yield some clues.

Middle age used to be the peak earning years on the job market, but this is no longer true, especially for men. People 45 to 54 are still earning more than than younger colleagues. What’s changed is on the other side of the age matrix: Older workers have increasingly gained ground on the income scale. The older they are, in fact, the more rapid the ascent up the income rankings.

Back in 1994, when the baby boom generation was filling in the 45-54 age group, a male full-time worker made $1.29 for every dollar made by other male full-time workers. Women in this age group were also the top earners, although female pay was not as disparate; they made $1.13 for every dollar made by other female colleagues.

Today, women still face a big pay gap with men, but among female workers there’s still less age disparity. For both genders, however, older workers — especially the rapidly growing pool of boomers over age 65 — are holding a growing share of the high-paying jobs.

The Grumpy Middle got to college around the time the drinking age was raised to 21 and were too young to enjoy all of the benefits of the booming 1980s economy, but old enough to have worked with older colleagues who could regale them with tales of how great things were for white-collar workers in the 1980s.

And now they’ve reached their peak earning years, only to find they are no longer peak earning years.

Put another way: America is getting older. But American wealth is aging even faster.

Historically, older Americans ranked near the bottom of the income and wealth scales, but by 2013, they were moving up the income ladder and comprising a greater share of wealth. That trend has accelerated.

As recently as 2010, Americans 65 and older comprised about a fifth of the population but a third of the wealthy population (those ranking above the 95th percentile).

This makes sense, given that older people have more time to accumulate savings, benefit from investments, and gain equity in real estate they may have bought decades earlier.

And older Americans have grown wealthier since, with a net gain of 750,000 spots in the top 5 percent. The number of 5 percenters below age 55 dropped by about 440,000.

Today’s older generation lived and worked through one of the greatest economic times in modern history. If they invested along the lines of the broader market, they reaped huge rewards. If they bought a house, it probably appreciated significantly. If they worked for a corporation, they are likely to have a generous retirement plan.

But they are also increasingly likely to work. And while for some this means working part-time in retail to supplement retirement income, the overall trend skews higher.

Older people are staying in full-time, high-paying jobs a lot longer than in the past. About 1 in 7 Americans over 65 worked full time last year, compared with 1 in 12 in 2000.

The occupation growth mirrors what we know about the rest of the economy. Compared with 15 years ago, older workers are much more likely to work as doctors, financial specialists and computer programmers.

They are less likely to work in sales, or on an assembly line.

So although older Americans have always been far more likely to be satisfied with their finances, they’re also riding a wave of increasing dominance on the income scale and hanging onto high-paying work, keeping some of those slightly younger 45-to-54-year-olds from ascending to those jobs. Maybe that’s part of why that younger group is grumpy.

Mr. Prayul and the department are nowhere near panic.
“They live beneath people’s houses, they live in holes, they live in the wilderness and in the ground.
“Stories of snakes invading homes always sound scary, but as long as you don’t provoke them, they won’t hurt you,” Mr. Prayul said.
“In Thailand, homes continue to expand into the natural environment, so there will be always more snakes in the homes,” Mr. Nonn said.","As of Monday, the department had received 31,801 calls this year for help in removing snakes. That is more calls than for all of last year (29,919), and more than three times the number in 2012 (10,492).

On one recent day, the fire department received 173 snake invasion calls, versus five fire alarms. “There’s no way we could survive if there were more fires than snakes,” said Prayul Krongyos, the department’s deputy director.

The department’s figures don’t even include the many thousands of snakes that are killed or removed by residents on their own or taken from homes by volunteer handlers.

Most of the snakes rescued by firefighters are taken to a wildlife center and eventually released in the wild.

Mr. Prayul and the department are nowhere near panic. One reason for the rising numbers is growing public awareness that firefighters can help remove snakes and other animals.

It has also been a wet year, even by Bangkok standards. Heavy rains bring a surge in the number of snakes seeking refuge indoors. Flooding can turn city streets into snake highways as the creatures are forced from their hiding places and swim for higher ground.

And as the sprawling city of more than 8.2 million people continues to expand into formerly wild lands, the number of snake encounters is rising. Most of the snake removal calls come from neighborhoods on the perimeter of the city where new housing is destroying what’s left of the creatures’ domain, Mr. Prayul explained.

“When people build houses in their habitat, of course they will seek a dry spot in people’s houses because they can’t go anywhere else,” he said.

All reasonable explanations. But casual discussion tends to end when it’s your toilet the snake is in.

“There are snakes everywhere!” said Kanok Praditkranok, Ms. Panarat’s husband. “They live beneath people’s houses, they live in holes, they live in the wilderness and in the ground. But they shouldn’t be able to enter people’s houses.”

The reality, though, is that humans cause snakes much more harm than the other way around.

Thailand has more than 200 snake species, including about three dozen that are venomous. But most do not pose a threat to people.

“Stories of snakes invading homes always sound scary, but as long as you don’t provoke them, they won’t hurt you,” Mr. Prayul said. “There are only a few cases where snakes come into people’s houses and hurt them.”

In Bangkok, where garbage bags often pile up on sidewalks awaiting collection, snakes perform a public service by catching rats and other vermin.

“Snakes are among the most misunderstood animals in the world,” said Nonn Panitvong, a leading expert in biodiversity. “People are afraid of snakes and don’t take time to identify them. In Thailand, they just kill the snakes.”

To keep the animals from being needlessly slaughtered, Mr. Nonn helped set up the “Snake at Home” message group on the popular Line phone app. People who encounter a snake can send a photo to the group’s volunteer experts and get an immediate reply on whether it is venomous.

“We can give them instant answers so maybe the snake will live,” said Mr. Nonn, who in August was named Thailand’s first ASEAN Biodiversity Hero, a new award created by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to honor conservation advocates.

Started this year, Snake at Home has 29,000 followers and receives nearly 30 identification requests a day.

The identification service also has helped save a number of humans.

Doctors make more than half the identification requests in the hope of learning whether a snake that bit a patient was venomous and, if so, which species, so they can use the correct antivenin.

“In Thailand, homes continue to expand into the natural environment, so there will be always more snakes in the homes,” Mr. Nonn said.

After the second python appeared in Ms. Panarat’s toilet, the family discovered that the soil under their five-year-old house had subsided and that there was an opening in the sewage pipe large enough for a big snake to enter.

The family fixed the problem and has not seen a python since.

Despite the widespread fear of snakes in Thailand, an encounter with one is considered by many to be a sign of good luck.

Ms. Panarat, who told her story on Facebook and posted photos of the captured snake, received half a dozen inquiries from people asking for her house number so they could use it when buying lottery tickets.

One relative wrote on her page, “There’s an old saying that if you encounter a snake, you will meet your soul mate.”

Ms. Panarat jokingly replied, “I’d rather be a widow.”","Lurking in Toilets, Swimming the Streets: Snakes of Bangkok Move In",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/world/asia/bangkok-snakes.html

Some things about Snapchat are not changing. For instance, the app still opens to the phone camera, allowing users to make and share photos and videos.

But the redesign otherwise moves Snapchat even further away from a traditional social media model.

Material shown on the app’s right side — what is now the media part — must meet content and community standards, Snap has decided, whether that material is produced by a newspaper, a television studio, the company’s in-house news and stories teams or so-called influencers. All must be vetted and approved.

By contrast, those who create content do not need to be vetted to distribute it widely on Facebook and Google. That has allowed hate speech, fake news and disturbing videos aimed at children to proliferate on those platforms. During the presidential election last year, Russian propagandists used Facebook, Google and Twitter to spread material meant to sow division and influence the outcome of the race.

“Separating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content — while addressing many of the problems that plague the internet today,” Mr. Spiegel said.

Philip Napoli, a professor of public policy at Duke who studies media and democracy, said that Snapchat’s redesign would test people’s willingness to embrace a social media app that relied more on human curators than algorithms.

“It wouldn’t surprise me if there’s enough of a consumer backlash to make this potentially viable, especially in light of the last year,” Professor Napoli said.

Snap said it was using a kind of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to understand what people like to see, based on their activity, and planned to offer them new content in line with those preferences.

There are limits to the amount of personalization that Snapchat will provide. In an approach similar to how Netflix widely promotes some television shows and movies, Snap will continue to promote some material — including breaking news, a new video series or a popular sporting event — to all of its users.

A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that Americans support same-sex marriage by a margin of nearly two-to-one. Forty-seven percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats voiced support of same-sex marriage in a 2017 Gallup poll. But what these numbers don’t reflect is how these views manifest themselves in daily life for L.G.B.T. Americans. This case is a public reminder that, though the law may guarantee a right, an individual’s actions can affect the way a group experiences its freedom.

I started planning my wedding in 2015, before I was engaged and before the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges made marriage equality the law of the land. I had a Google Doc full of pictures of obsidian tulips and interracial cake toppers, waiting on the world to change. My now-husband didn’t know what I was up to. But that didn’t matter. I was setting intentions for everything from my destiny to my cake flavors, irrespective of what the law would allow. However, once I started planning in earnest, I realized that actually executing a wedding is miserable and all I wanted was to begin my life with my husband as soon as possible.

Nothing has surprised me more than finding out I abhorred wedding planning. I consider myself a mix of Auntie Mame and the guy who is always dropping by Ina Garten’s house just in time for crudités and gossip. Putting on a huge to-do is what I was born for. I see it as part of a queer cultural inheritance: a resilient determination to celebrate, despite oppressive social policies.

It felt like the dream of my ancestors that I would be able to register for expensive gravy boats and sign a document held in City Hall. It also felt like a chore.

The saving grace of the monthslong gantlet was the promise of wedding expos. Americans spent an average of $35,329 on their weddings in 2016, according to a survey by the wedding site TheKnot.com. As in any other lucrative industry, there are thousands of vendors — caterers, florists, lighting designers — who would love nothing more than to help couples create their special day, for a price. Those vendors come together under one roof to lobby for business at wedding expos, which are like an office supply fair crossed with the Golden Globes. My dream.

“I have been waiting for this moment my entire life,” I told my husband-to-be, David, clutching my first expo registration like a golden ticket. “There will be so much free cake! There will be brochures! About napkins!” I waxed rhapsodic about signing onto the mailing lists of various D.J.’s; he nodded. He expressed regrets he couldn’t join. He’s a pastor and the expo was on a Sunday, a work day.

I wasn’t about to let religious expression get in the way of my pursuit of cake samples, so I went alone.

“Where’s the bride-to-be?” a vendor asked as I stared at his tower of orchids. I replied, “Well, there isn’t one.”

A lighting designer asked, “Are you making decisions for the lucky lady?” I cocked my head. “I am the lucky lady,” I said.

I had expected to be showered with attention and, more important, complimentary carbohydrates. Despite my “I’m getting married!” sticker, I found myself ignored.

I ventured up to the third floor and found a table with a surfeit of cake options, but no labels. “Do you think one of these is lemon?” a woman next to me asked. I turned to her: “There’s only one way to find out.”

She replied, “Eat them all?” My soul mate.

She asked me if I was enjoying myself. I shrugged. “Apparently, you’re invisible without a bride,” I said.

She told me she understood. She wore scrubs, with her hair tied back, a marked difference from the party-casual dress of many other attendees. She explained that she was a vet and had accidentally left her engagement ring at work. Grabbing two more slices of cake, we wandered away from the table.

We were interrupted by a voice: “Hello, young lovers!” We found ourselves in front of a centerpiece vendor who hadn’t had time for me earlier. A woman behind the table waved at us. “So, when’s the big day?” I looked at the vet. The vet replied, “August.”

“How big?” the vendor asked.

“150 people?” I said.

“So exciting,” the vendor said, as she cracked open a huge binder. As we excused ourselves, she grabbed my arm. “There’s Champagne downstairs,” she said, conspiratorially. “Make sure you all get some!”

Separately, the vet and I were two lonely, barely visible people with icing on our fingers. Together, we became a charming young black couple with a summer wedding and a deep interest in as many bite-size shortcakes as we could find. We looked the way people expected young and cake-worthy couples to look.

We agreed to take this expo for everything it had to offer. It turns out heteronormativity is a very effective con.

We bounced from table to table, collecting samples and spinning a tale of our joint bliss. At one point, taking a break from fish tacos and parfait trays, we leaned over a balcony and confessed that the process was harder than we’d thought it was going to be. Money was shorter; time was fleeting; nothing felt magical. It was easy to feel you were doing it all wrong.

“Thank you for being here,” I said. She and I may not have aligned with vendors’ ideas of who they were supposed to serve, but we both belonged.

Ignoring a person, a union or an expression of love will not make it go away. We all have the right to free samples, to be seen and to be overwhelmed by the reality of our love.

As the vet and I made moves to part ways, we realized we didn’t know each other’s names.

These downsides of A.I. are no secret. Despite this, state and local law enforcement agencies have begun to use predictive policing applications fueled by A.I. like HunchLab, which combines historical crime data, moon phases, location, census data and even professional sports team schedules to predict when and where crime will occur and even who’s likely to commit or be a victim of certain crimes.

The problem with historical crime data is that it’s based upon policing practices that already disproportionately home in on blacks, Latinos, and those who live in low-income areas.

If the police have discriminated in the past, predictive technology reinforces and perpetuates the problem, sending more officers after people who we know are already targeted and unfairly treated, given recent evidence like the Justice Department’s reports on Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, and the findings of the San Francisco Blue Ribbon Panel on Transparency Accountability and Fairness in Law Enforcement.

It’s no wonder criminologists have raised red flags about the self-fulfilling nature of using historical crime data.

This hits close to home. An October 2016 study by the Human Rights Data Analysis Group concluded that if the Oakland Police Department used its 2010 record of drug-crimes information as the basis of an algorithm to guide policing, the department “would have dispatched officers almost exclusively to lower-income, minority neighborhoods,” despite the fact that public-health-based estimates suggest that drug use is much more widespread, taking place in many other parts of the city where my family and I live.

Those “lower-income, minority neighborhoods” contain the barbershop where I take my son for his monthly haircut and our favorite hoagie shop. Would I let him run ahead of me if I knew that simply setting foot on those sidewalks would make him more likely to be seen as a criminal in the eyes of the law?

The risks are even more acute (and unavoidable) for those who can afford to live only in the neighborhoods that A.I. would most likely lead officers to focus on.

There’s yet another opportunity for racial bias to infuse the process when risk-assessment algorithms created by A.I. and machine learning are used to help to sentence criminals, as they already are in courts around the country.

Without a commitment to ensure that the data being used to fuel A.I. doesn’t replicate historical racism, biases will be built into the foundation of many “intelligent” systems shaping how we live. It’s not that I want this technology to be rejected. There are ways to make A.I. work. But before it is used in law enforcement, it must be thoroughly tested and proven not to disproportionately harm communities of color.

They expressed disappointment that Pope Francis, admired for speaking out for the downtrodden, had gone quiet for fear of endangering his own flock in Myanmar.
He relived in detail the meeting with Rohingya refugees at a packed interreligious meeting in the garden of the Dhaka archbishop’s residence.
“So I asked for the microphone,” and that is when the pope finally said, “Rohingya.”","“I am very, very satisfied with the meetings,” he said.

In his nearly hourlong remarks, the pope sought to explain his approach to effective diplomacy (“one half step back, one step forward”) and strategic communications (“the most important thing is that the message gets across”) and even offered his geopolitical analysis, explaining that someone had told him that the area of Myanmar where the Rohingya lived was “rich in precious stones” and that outside interests perhaps wanted it emptied for mining. “But I don’t know if it’s true,” he said.

He called the meeting with the Rohingya in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a “condition of the trip,” and opened up about the emotions he experienced visiting with 16 survivors of the persecution, to whom he vowed: “We won’t close our hearts or look away. The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.”

Aboard the plane, the pope flashed a defensive streak about his avoidance of using the politically contentious word during his days in Myanmar.

“If I had said that word in the official speeches, it would have been a door slammed in the face,” he said, using a metaphor he turned to several times, and which he said evoked for him the image of how an angry teenager vents frustration.

“It’s true I didn’t have the pleasure of slamming the door in their face publicly with a denunciation,” the pope said. “But I had the satisfaction of dialogue, and letting the other side dialogue, and in this way the message arrived.”

He argued that his caution granted him access to private meetings, where he could be more frank.

Of his meeting with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has led a campaign of mass murder, rape and arson against the Rohingya, the pope said that “I did not negotiate with the truth” during the conversation and that he made the general understand that the horrors of the past were no longer viable.

The general had demanded to meet with Pope Francis before the pontiff saw Myanmar’s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose reputation has suffered for her failure to forcefully condemn the killings. (The pope suggested she be cut some slack, saying, “In Myanmar, it’s difficult to evaluate a criticism without asking, ‘Is it possible to have done this?’”)

When a reporter asked the pope if he worried he had been used as a political pawn by the general to show the country who was boss, the pope said, “The intention of that I do not know, but I was interested in dialogue.” Pressed if he had used the word “Rohingya” in the private meeting, he responded that once he made sure the general understood his message, “I dared say everything I wanted to say.”

All of that diplomatic work, the pope suggested, was done to encourage Myanmar, a country “at the tipping point,” to push ahead toward democracy. And he likewise suggested that his silence on the Rohingya paid off with the trip’s culminating meeting with the refugees in Dhaka on Friday.

He pointed out that TG1, an Italian news program, dedicated a long segment to the meeting. “You saw today the front pages of the papers. All of them have received the message. And I have not heard any criticism. Maybe there is, but I haven’t heard it.”

The old Francis charm, he seemed to be saying, was back in action.

At different points of the trip, humanitarian activists had wondered where his special touch had gone. They expressed disappointment that Pope Francis, admired for speaking out for the downtrodden, had gone quiet for fear of endangering his own flock in Myanmar. Some analysts questioned how it affected his moral authority. Locals doubted his influence.

Last Monday, when the pope arrived in Yangon, Myanmar, and met with General Min Aung Hlaing, a woman, Hla Yin Win, 31, was walking around the city’s revered pagoda complex with her husband and baby daughter. She stopped in front of a wood shrine with gold-painted pillars dedicated by Buddhist faithful from the Rakhine State, where the Rohingya have been persecuted.

Ms. Win said that she liked the general “because the military power is important for our country,” that she appreciated the soldiers “doing their duty” and that she considered the Rohingya, who had been in the country for generations, “illegal immigrants who don’t speak Burmese and are bad for our country.”

Asked if she thought the pope could make a difference in the crisis, she shook her head.

“He doesn’t matter,” she said.

On the plane the pope reminded why he did matter. He relived in detail the meeting with Rohingya refugees at a packed interreligious meeting in the garden of the Dhaka archbishop’s residence.

He explained that at the end of the event, the 16 men, women and children came up to the stage, but that organizers “immediately wanted to kick them off the scene. That’s when I got angry. I yelled a bit.”

He met with them individually and added that he could not let them leave without saying a word.

“In that moment, I began to feel things inside. I was crying but I tried to hide it. They were crying too,” he said. “So I asked for the microphone,” and that is when the pope finally said, “Rohingya.”",Pope Defends His Myanmar Diplomacy: ‘I Did Not Negotiate With the Truth’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/asia/pope-francis-myanmar-rohingya.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Sackler, for example, is a trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which was recorded as receiving $2.49 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2003 and 2015.","But few institutions seem concerned that the money they have received may be tied, in some way, to a family fortune partly built on the sale of opioids.

The New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organizations listed on tax forms as having received significant sums from foundations run by two Sackler brothers who led Purdue. Several, including the Guggenheim, declined to comment; others, like the Brooklyn Museum, ignored questions. None indicated that they would return donations or refuse them in the future.

“We regularly assess our funding activities to ensure best practice,” wrote Zoë Franklin, a spokeswoman for the Victoria and Albert Museum, which was listed as receiving about $13.1 million from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation in 2012. “The Sackler family continue to be an important and valuable donor to the V & A and we are grateful for their ongoing support.”

To what degree are cultural institutions responsible for vetting every dollar they receive? Can financially strapped arts organizations be picky about a patron’s source of wealth, and if so, where should they draw the line? At a donor who engages in unlawful or unethical behavior? Or whose conduct is at odds with the institution’s goals?

The issue stretches back to the days of Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and the Rockefellers, cultural philanthropists whose sources of income were characterized at some point as monopolistic, or anti-union or harmful to the environment.

In 2015, to name a more recent example, some critics called for museums of science and natural history to cut ties with fossil fuel companies and philanthropists like David H. Koch, whose foundation has financed groups that went on to oppose legislation related to climate change or refer to “global warming hysteria.” (When Mr. Koch stepped down from the American Museum of Natural History’s board the following year, the museum said the decision was not prompted by the protests.)

But museums have shown an unwillingness to return money or end a philanthropic relationship.

“Historically, museum audiences have not shown evidence of being terribly concerned about sources of income for museums,” said Susie Wilkening, a museum consultant in Seattle. “Especially if there is no conflict between the mission of the museum and the philosophies or beliefs of the donor.”

In the case of the Sacklers, OxyContin’s ties to the opioid crisis have become a public relations blemish. But activists have not mustered campaigns against institutions that benefit from the Sacklers’ largess. And there appears to be no push in Congress for members who have received donations from Purdue to return that money.

The Times’ questions to the 21 institutions focused on money from five foundations that have been run by members of the Sackler family, including Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, two of the three Brooklyn-born physician brothers who transformed Purdue into a pharmaceutical giant. The two served as co-chief executives of Purdue before they died, and their foundations have given substantial sums to cultural and educational organizations since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. In some years, the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation has listed Purdue Pharma as one of its sources of money.

Some of Mortimer and Raymond’s descendants have sat on the company’s board or held executive positions since the mid-90s. In response to inquiries by the Times, Purdue confirmed that Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, one of Mortimer’s daughters; Mortimer D.A. Sackler, one of his sons; and Theresa Elizabeth Sackler, his widow, are directors of the company’s board today. But the company did not say whether any other family members currently serve on the board and did not provide a requested list of those who did from 1995 to 2007.

(The shares of Arthur Sackler, the eldest brother and third owner of Purdue, were bought by Mortimer and Raymond at some point, according to The New Yorker. Arthur’s descendants have said they have not profited from the sale of OxyContin.)

In October, Purdue said that it was cooperating with a new federal investigation related to OxyContin. In response to lawsuits by New Jersey, Alaska and Washington, the company has vigorously denied allegations that it used deceptive marketing to boost sales of the drug.

Robert Josephson, a spokesman for the company, pointed to its efforts to stem the opioid epidemic — distributing prescription guidelines, developing abuse-deterrent painkillers and ensuring access to overdose-reversal medication — and noted that OxyContin has never had a large share of total opioid prescriptions. In an email, he added, “Many leading medical, scientific, cultural and educational institutions throughout the world have been beneficiaries of Sackler family philanthropy.”

Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for the families of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, declined on their behalf to comment.

Andrew Ross, a professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University, said that donors sometimes give hefty amounts to institutions in an effort to shift attention from business practices that may strike some as unsavory.

Such donations have opened organizations to criticism. In the 1980s, for example, antismoking groups denounced the Joffrey Ballet and other institutions for accepting money from tobacco companies.

“That’s a risk museums take on by having these sorts of trustees and donors,” Professor Ross said. “They are supposed to have ethical values baked in, and because they trade in culture we expect different standards from them.”

But some in the arts world see the acceptance of donations not as an endorsement or political statement but simply as a way to support programming.

Reynold Levy, who was president of Lincoln Center for 13 years, said institutions would be unlikely to change the behavior of donors by rejecting their money. And, he added, declining donations from people who are acting lawfully could create a slippery slope of shifting standards that would do little to benefit an organization’s audience.

“For institutions to draw lines outside of the law, there would need to be a pretty heavy burden of persuasion to refuse a gift that would advance a meritorious mission,” he said, adding that at the same time “board members should feel free to raise these questions and issues.”

Of course, it might be uncomfortable to begin such conversations when donors are closely tied to an institution. Mortimer D.A. Sackler, for example, is a trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which was recorded as receiving $2.49 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2003 and 2015. Ilene Sackler Lefcourt is an honorary trustee of the American Museum of Natural History, which was listed as receiving $1.7 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2006 and 2013.

Anne Canty, a spokeswoman at the natural history museum, suggested that it needed time to take stock of the recent reporting on the Sacklers.

“Since this has all emerged very recently, we haven’t had sufficient time to fully absorb it so we don’t have any comment,” she wrote.",Gifts Tied to Opioid Sales Invite a Question: Should Museums Vet Donors?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/arts/design/sackler-museum-donations-oxycontin-purdue-pharma.html

Ms. Blesener said she plans to continue to photograph the boys until they are seniors in high school.","These days, images of the Mott Haven neighborhood in the South Bronx tend to showcase either gleaming new buildings or still-warm bullet casings framed by police tape. Stories often dwell on the gentrifying neighborhood’s property sales or the latest murder in the 40th precinct.

With coverage like that, it’s easy to forget that people live, love and grow up there.

In “Haven,” the photographer Sarah Blesener looks beyond the headlines, capturing a group of neighborhood boys coming of age. Her images defy the one-dimensional stereotype of “young boys in the Bronx.” No gang signs or bandanas, no flashing of guns, no clutched Hennessy bottles or blunts. Just kids.

Kids who cram into their mothers’ couches and text, who sit on each other’s beds like it’s their own, who spot each other a few quarters for chips and soda, who get nervous talking to their crush. They live in housing projects within walking distance of each other. Members of their family have been incarcerated, and they live in fear of being arrested themselves, as well as being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Their demeaners balance maturity and boyishness in a way those who live outside their neighborhood don’t necessarily get.

Ms. Blesener was born and raised in Minnesota and has only spent a few years in New York. One day, she was shooting a portrait of Chavi, 14, the first boy in the group she met through a friend at ICP, where she is a student. Chavi dreams of being a bachata star like another Bronx kid done good, Romeo Santos. After releasing a new single and asking Ms. Blesener for a portrait, she suggested they go up to a rooftop to get a panorama of the Bronx. Chavi was nervous, and after a few shots, asked to go back downstairs. Ms. Blesener didn’t understand why. He spelled it out for her: She can afford to get into trouble, he told her, but he can’t. “It really sucks that he has to be so aware of that at such a young age,” she said.

There are other things Chavi and his boys are aware of, too, like their neighborhood changing almost daily with expensive apartments, new cafes, restaurants and galleries. “They are all afraid of being left behind,” said Ms. Blesener, who recounted how she’d often make the walk with them down Third Avenue, and they’d stop and point out signs of gentrification: new businesses, shuttered ones, unfamiliar faces. In one photograph, they play softball in a field not far from Yankee Stadium. Behind them, a new construction project looms.

When Ms. Blesener met Chavi and his four friends as freshmen in high school, they were so shy they’d barely swear around her. Then she spent time with them, met their families and their girlfriends and they opened up. They are juniors now, experiencing their first breakups, their voices changing, and the feeling of being too cool to talk to anyone as openly as they once did.

Ms. Blesener said she plans to continue to photograph the boys until they are seniors in high school. The culmination, she hopes, will paint a different image of what it means to grow up in a neighborhood like Mott Haven.

“There’s nothing but bad statements about the place, especially when it comes to teenagers,” she said. “But these kids are really set on defying that. They don’t want to be put in those types of boxes.”

“It’s true I didn’t have the pleasure of slamming the door in their face publicly with a denunciation,” the pope said.
They expressed disappointment that Pope Francis, admired for speaking out for the downtrodden, had gone quiet for fear of endangering his own flock in Myanmar.
He relived in detail the meeting with Rohingya refugees at a packed interreligious meeting in the garden of the Dhaka archbishop’s residence.
“So I asked for the microphone,” and that is when the pope finally said, “Rohingya.”","“I am very, very satisfied with the meetings,” he said.

In his nearly hourlong remarks, the pope sought to explain his approach to effective diplomacy (“one half step back, one step forward”) and strategic communications (“the most important thing is that the message gets across”) and even offered his geopolitical analysis, explaining that someone had told him that the area of Myanmar where the Rohingya lived was “rich in precious stones” and that outside interests perhaps wanted it emptied for mining. “But I don’t know if it’s true,” he said.

He called the meeting with the Rohingya in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a “condition of the trip,” and opened up about the emotions he experienced visiting with 16 survivors of the persecution, to whom he vowed: “We won’t close our hearts or look away. The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.”

Aboard the plane, the pope flashed a defensive streak about his avoidance of using the politically contentious word during his days in Myanmar.

“If I had said that word in the official speeches, it would have been a door slammed in the face,” he said, using a metaphor he turned to several times, and which he said evoked for him the image of how an angry teenager vents frustration.

“It’s true I didn’t have the pleasure of slamming the door in their face publicly with a denunciation,” the pope said. “But I had the satisfaction of dialogue, and letting the other side dialogue, and in this way the message arrived.”

He argued that his caution granted him access to private meetings, where he could be more frank.

Of his meeting with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has led a campaign of mass murder, rape and arson against the Rohingya, the pope said that “I did not negotiate with the truth” during the conversation and that he made the general understand that the horrors of the past were no longer viable.

The general had demanded to meet with Pope Francis before the pontiff saw Myanmar’s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose reputation has suffered for her failure to forcefully condemn the killings. (The pope suggested she be cut some slack, saying, “In Myanmar, it’s difficult to evaluate a criticism without asking, ‘Is it possible to have done this?’”)

When a reporter asked the pope if he worried he had been used as a political pawn by the general to show the country who was boss, the pope said, “The intention of that I do not know, but I was interested in dialogue.” Pressed if he had used the word “Rohingya” in the private meeting, he responded that once he made sure the general understood his message, “I dared say everything I wanted to say.”

All of that diplomatic work, the pope suggested, was done to encourage Myanmar, a country “at the tipping point,” to push ahead toward democracy. And he likewise suggested that his silence on the Rohingya paid off with the trip’s culminating meeting with the refugees in Dhaka on Friday.

He pointed out that TG1, an Italian news program, dedicated a long segment to the meeting. “You saw today the front pages of the papers. All of them have received the message. And I have not heard any criticism. Maybe there is, but I haven’t heard it.”

The old Francis charm, he seemed to be saying, was back in action.

At different points of the trip, humanitarian activists had wondered where his special touch had gone. They expressed disappointment that Pope Francis, admired for speaking out for the downtrodden, had gone quiet for fear of endangering his own flock in Myanmar. Some analysts questioned how it affected his moral authority. Locals doubted his influence.

Last Monday, when the pope arrived in Yangon, Myanmar, and met with General Min Aung Hlaing, a woman, Hla Yin Win, 31, was walking around the city’s revered pagoda complex with her husband and baby daughter. She stopped in front of a wood shrine with gold-painted pillars dedicated by Buddhist faithful from the Rakhine State, where the Rohingya have been persecuted.

Ms. Win said that she liked the general “because the military power is important for our country,” that she appreciated the soldiers “doing their duty” and that she considered the Rohingya, who had been in the country for generations, “illegal immigrants who don’t speak Burmese and are bad for our country.”

Asked if she thought the pope could make a difference in the crisis, she shook her head.

“He doesn’t matter,” she said.

On the plane the pope reminded why he did matter. He relived in detail the meeting with Rohingya refugees at a packed interreligious meeting in the garden of the Dhaka archbishop’s residence.

He explained that at the end of the event, the 16 men, women and children came up to the stage, but that organizers “immediately wanted to kick them off the scene. That’s when I got angry. I yelled a bit.”

He met with them individually and added that he could not let them leave without saying a word.

“In that moment, I began to feel things inside. I was crying but I tried to hide it. They were crying too,” he said. “So I asked for the microphone,” and that is when the pope finally said, “Rohingya.”",Pope Defends His Myanmar Diplomacy: ‘I Did Not Negotiate With the Truth’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/asia/pope-francis-myanmar-rohingya.html

During the recent competition, Ms. Kutin cheered on her family and joked about her superstrong children shirking chores.
“I told him, ‘We’re fine, you have no idea who she is,’” Ms. Kutin recalled.
“She said, ‘I thought you’d never ask me,’” Ms. Kutin recalled.
Fans and fellow competitors often give Naomi Supergirl memorabilia.","Naomi started lifting competitively when she was 8 and quickly began setting national and world records in adult powerlifting categories. By 9, as a wispy 88-pounder competing in the 97-pound weight class, she squatted 215 pounds to break a world record held by a 44-year-old German woman.

Naomi is now 16, but her slim build makes her heavy lifts look even more incredible, and early on she gained the Supergirl nickname as a sweet description for a diminutive athlete. But the name has expanded into an intensely competitive alter ego for an otherwise shy and unassuming teenager.

“In school plays, I get stage fright, but I don’t have stage fright in powerlifting, even if I’m in front of hundreds of people,” said Naomi, whose modern Orthodox Jewish family follows strict religious rules.

While she must wear modest attire at her all-girls Yeshiva in Teaneck, her powerlifting outfit includes a singlet and T-shirt, as well as colorfully striped knee socks, always mismatched, and bright red high-tops.

To work herself into an adrenaline-fueled zone of concentration at the recent Sunday competition, she paced behind the lifting area, with heavy metal blasting on her headphones.

“I hate it — I only listen to it before I lift,” said Naomi, who approaches the bar with yells, growls, staccato breathing and pumping arms. It is an unexpected preparatory ritual from a teenage girl who spends her weekdays studying the Talmud.

Naomi often competes alongside her 14-year-old brother, Ari, and their father, Ed Kutin, both of whom are also accomplished lifters. Her mother, Neshama, assumes the role of manager. During the recent competition, Ms. Kutin cheered on her family and joked about her superstrong children shirking chores.

“They’re lifting in the 300- to 350-pound range, but you should be there when I ask them to carry in the packages,” she said.

In truth, she said, they are helpful. Years ago, Naomi helped with the groceries by carrying a 60-pound bag of dog food out of the supermarket. A bystander called it too heavy a load for a child.

“I told him, ‘We’re fine, you have no idea who she is,’” Ms. Kutin recalled.

As a child, Naomi was a standout in karate and could beat the local boys at push-ups and other strength exercises. Her father, a longtime powerlifter, asked her to join his lifting workouts.

“She said, ‘I thought you’d never ask me,’” Ms. Kutin recalled.

The family ran it by their rabbi, since it is an unconventional activity for Orthodox girls. And then Naomi was off and lifting.

Too young for a gym membership, Naomi worked out with Mr. Kutin’s weights in the basement next to the washer and dryer.

Mr. Kutin taught Naomi basic techniques and grounded her in the rudiments of athletic motivation: the first three “Rocky” movies.

“We thought when she first started that it’d be a kid fad, that she’d quit within three months,” Ms. Kutin said recently as the family trained in their cramped basement.

On the wall was her hand-scrawled sign — “No Fear” — next to a Jewish calendar.

Naomi cranked up the heavy metal music and loaded heavy plates on the bar for sets of squats, lowering into a crouch with the weight bar on her shoulders. Then came dead lifts, short hoists from the ground while standing.

Naomi is the subject of a documentary “Supergirl,” to be broadcast Dec. 18 as part of the Independent Lens series on PBS.

The Kutins are often the only observant Jewish family at lifting meets, and they bring a large box of kosher food and drinks. Fans and fellow competitors often give Naomi Supergirl memorabilia.

Because of Sabbath rules, they do not compete on Saturdays, when many of the female trials are held. Many tournament officials allow Naomi to lift on Sunday with men competing in the heavyweight category.

It is quite a sight: a wispy teenage girl lifting alongside musclebound and heavily tattooed men.

“Most women and kids don’t do that,” she said. “But men get more physically psyched, so I actually prefer lifting with the men.”","Meet ‘Supergirl,’ the World’s Strongest Teenager",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/nyregion/meet-supergirl-the-worlds-strongest-teenager.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, said Saturday night that the company would begin an investigation of Mr. Levine.
But rumors about Mr. Levine and sexual abuse have also circulated for years.
As of Saturday night, Mr. Levine was still scheduled to conduct “Tosca” on New Year’s Eve.","Mr. Levine did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through the Met.

The man, who grew up in Illinois, said he had met Mr. Levine at the Ravinia Festival, the summer music event Mr. Levine led as music director from 1973 through 1993, according to the police report. The New York Post first reported details from the report Saturday.

The man told the police that he was a music lover with dreams of becoming a conductor, and that he was 4 years old when his parents first took him to meet Mr. Levine at Ravinia. He told the police that the misconduct began in the summer of 1985, when he was 15 and Mr. Levine was in his early 40s. He told the police that Mr. Levine drove him home and, in the driveway of his family’s home in Kenilworth, “started holding my hand in a prolonged and incredibly sensual way.”

He said that Mr. Levine told him he wanted “to see if you can be raised special like me.”

The abuse escalated the following summer, the man told the police, when he would visit Mr. Levine at the Deer Path Inn, a hotel near Ravinia.

“I would get there and the lights are off, and he would say to me after I came in and after a hug ‘take your clothes off,’” the man wrote in a statement to the police.

“On various occasions he would ask me how I touched myself and then he would touch me the way I touched myself,” the man wrote. “I was never able to be aroused by this. But then he would masturbate himself at his bed or in the bathroom.”

The police report contains a college recommendation that Mr. Levine wrote for the man on Met stationery in 1987. In it, Mr. Levine wrote that he had known the teenager for “almost fifteen years.” The man also told the police that Mr. Levine had given him money over the years, which he estimated added up to $50,000.

Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, said Saturday night that the company would begin an investigation of Mr. Levine.

“This first came to the Met’s attention when the Illinois police investigation was opened in October of 2016,” Mr. Gelb said. “At the time Jim said that the charges were completely false, and we didn’t hear anything further from the police. We need to determine if these charges are true and, if they are, take appropriate action. We will now be conducting our own investigation with outside resources.”

The man told the police that the abuse went on for years, and that “this pattern repeated itself hundreds of times,” later continuing in New York City. At one point, the man wrote, Mr. Levine invited him to New York for an audition to see if he had the makings of a conductor — and concluded that he did not, and that he should focus on his other talents. “While the musical mentorship potential was over at the end of the audition, the promise of his raising me ‘special’ like him never ended,” he wrote in the statement to the police.

The man told the police that he “only recently realized” that his history with Mr. Levine was affecting his life in “a negative manner.” The police report indicates that Lake Forest detectives interviewed Mr. Gelb of the Met and several journalists who have written about Mr. Levine over the years. Detective Wendy Dumont of the Lake Forest Police declined to comment when reached Saturday.

Beth Glynn, a former board member at the Met Opera, confirmed on Saturday that she had spoken with a police detective after having been called by the man accusing Mr. Levine of misconduct.

“I don’t know how he got my number,” she said in a brief phone interview. “I told him twice he must call the police and I hung up.”

Mr. Levine, 74, is among the world’s most famous and influential conductors, a star of European festivals and American orchestras alike. But his commitment to the Met is unprecedented — he has been virtually synonymous with it since he became its music director four decades ago. He has led more than 2,500 performances with the company, more than any other conductor — expanding its repertory, spurring the creation of its young artists’ program and raising its orchestra’s level to that of the world’s finest symphonic ensembles. Mr. Levine was paid $1.8 million for the 2015-16 season, according to the Met’s most recent tax filings.

But rumors about Mr. Levine and sexual abuse have also circulated for years. Johanna Fiedler, who was the Met’s press representative for 15 years, wrote about them in her 2001 book “Molto Agitato: The Mayhem Behind the Music at the Metropolitan Opera.”

“Starting in the spring of 1979, these stories came to the surface at more or less regular intervals,” she wrote. “Each time, the Met press office would tirelessly point out the cyclical nature of the gossip and the complete lack of substance.”

In 1987 Mr. Levine dismissed the rumors in an interview with The Times, recalling that he had been told years earlier that there were “reports of a morals charge in Pittsburgh or Hawaii or Dallas.”

“Both my friends and my enemies checked it out and to this day, I don’t have the faintest idea where those rumors came from or what purpose they served,” Mr. Levine said at the time.

In recent years Mr. Levine has struggled with health problems and surgeries, which caused him to resign as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, after seven seasons, in 2011. He missed two Met seasons after sustaining a spinal injury that year.

He returned in 2013, but complications related to his Parkinson’s disease sometimes caused his left arm to flail and made it increasingly difficult for performers to follow his conducting. He stepped down from his position in April 2016, becoming the Met’s music director emeritus.

Mr. Levine’s physical capacities have lately seemed to improve, and he has a robust schedule at the Met this season, already leading a run of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” and Verdi’s Requiem this fall. He has jumped into a new production of Puccini’s “Tosca” set to premiere on New Year’s Eve, with Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” and “Luisa Miller” to follow in coming months.

As the tax cut legislation passed by the Senate early Saturday hurtles toward final approval, Republicans are preparing to use the swelling deficits made worse by the package as a rationale to pursue their long-held vision: undoing the entitlements of the New Deal and Great Society, leaving government leaner and the safety net skimpier for millions of Americans.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other Republicans are beginning to express their big dreams publicly, vowing that next year they will move on to changes in Medicare and Social Security. President Trump told a Missouri rally last week, “We’re going to go into welfare reform.”

Their nearly $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts, a plan likely to win final approval in the coming days, could be the first step. But their strategy poses enormous risks, not only for millions of Americans who rely on entitlement programs, but also for Republicans who would wade into politically difficult waters, cutting popular benefits for the elderly and working poor just after cutting taxes for profitable corporations.

“The way to get at fixing the debt is to feel like everybody is willing to put something on the table,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group. “Once you have one side grab all it could, you’re never going to have the other side show up.”

Even if the tax cut sparks the kind of economic growth that Republicans advertise, the tax bill will increase the deficit by $1 trillion over 10 years, the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said.

And it was passed along sharply partisan lines, offering nothing to Democrats, and leaving them with no obligation or incentive to negotiate cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, the entitlement programs that are driving up spending, but are also the pride of the Democratic Party.

For his part, Mr. Trump spent his campaign promising not to cut Medicare and Social Security. And Republicans will probably find, as they did when they failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that the public rises up to defend the programs they are trying to cut. Whatever political boost the Republicans could get for passing a tax cut could evaporate fast.

“Republicans are going to find that Democrats treat this tax bill the way Republicans treated Obamacare — it’s not trusted by people on the other side of the aisle,” said former Senator Judd Gregg, who was chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Simpson-Bowles commission, a bipartisan group of lawmakers and budget experts that produced a deficit reduction plan in 2010. “It will become a target, a rallying cry, which is unfortunate, because good tax reform, when done right, is not only good for the economy, it’s good for the parties.”

Many of the Republicans’ natural allies have criticized the bill for adding to the deficit and not dealing with the costs that were already driving up the government’s red ink. In an op-ed in The Washington Post, the leaders of that 2010 commission, former Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a Republican, and Erskine Bowles, a Democrat who is a former White House chief of staff, accused the Republicans of “deficit denial,” saying the bill incorporated only “goodies” and virtually no “hard choices.”

“Republicans have been telling themselves for years that they wanted to get into power so they could balance the budget, reduce the debt, cut spending and fix entitlements,” Ms. MacGuineas said. “They’ve just made it harder, not easier.”

For weeks, Democrats and their allies have been accusing Republicans of a “two-step” deceit, warning that they would cut taxes now and then use the increase in the deficit they caused to demand entitlement cuts later.

“When you run up the deficit, your next argument will be, ‘Gee, you’ve got a large deficit,’” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said in an interview.

Now Republicans are beginning to acknowledge as much. Mr. Ryan said at a town hall-style meeting last month that Congress had to spur growth and cut entitlements to reduce the national debt.

The Republican tax plan, he said “grows the economy.” But, he added, “we’ve got a lot of work to do in cutting spending.”

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was more specific on Wednesday, telling business leaders that the tax cuts were just the first step; the next is to reshape Social Security and Medicare for future retirees.

“Many argue that you can’t cut taxes because it will drive up the deficit,” he said. “But we have to do two things. We have to generate economic growth, which generates revenue, while reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.”

The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will cost the federal government $28.6 trillion through 2027. The tax cut, estimated at nearly $1.5 trillion, makes the problem only mildly worse.

But if that trillion-dollar boost to the government’s yawning fiscal hole is comparatively small mathematically, it could add up to much more politically if it keeps Democrats away from the negotiating table.

And even if Republicans do not pursue changes to entitlements, the tax bill will trigger pay-as-you-go requirements that Congress cut spending. That would be a particularly big hit to Medicare, which would face a $25 billion cut for the current fiscal year. Groups like AARP, the lobby for older Americans, warn that it would force doctors and hospitals to turn away patients because reimbursements would be cut so drastically.

Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, released a statement Friday saying that the so-called pay-go cuts “will not happen” because Congress would waive the law, as it has in the past. But they will need Democratic votes to do that, in a climate that is unusually partisan.

Regardless of whether Republicans can waive these cuts, David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP, said, “You know they’re going to come back and say, ‘We need to make more cuts to deal with the growing debts and deficit.’”

Some deficit hawks complain that Republicans have cast away any mantle of fiscal responsibility.

Robert L. Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that encourages fiscal responsibility, complained of hypocrisy from Republicans who have been clamoring to lift the spending caps that were created by the 2011 Budget Control Act.

If the tax cuts do not generate the revenue Republicans are expecting, he predicted, “people will say, ‘No, we’re not getting the growth because we should have cut taxes even more.’”

The United States is already facing a gloomy fiscal landscape. The federal deficit this year topped $660 billion, despite healthy economic growth, and the national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, appointed by President Barack Obama, warned last week that the national debt “is the type of thing that should keep people awake at night.”

But Democrats and their allies — and even some usual Republican allies — complain that Republicans are dishonest not to debate changes in spending and tax cuts at the same time, as the Simpson-Bowles commission did.

Sharon Parrott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Republicans understood how bad it would look to cut food benefits for poor families and health care for the elderly at the same time they were cutting taxes for corporations and the highest earners.

“There’s a reason they separate them,” she said. “They think they can get away with it.”

But in an election year with high political engagement, she said, “I think it’s wrong to count out the idea that the public will figure it out.”

3. Amid the intense pressures of the week, President Trump displayed his ability to dominate news cycles with tossed-off comments and tweets.

He ignited a racially charged controversy by invoking “Pocahontas” — a favorite slight against Senator Elizabeth Warren — in a ceremony honoring Navajo veterans, above. Days later, British lawmakers derided him as a “fascist” and “stupid” after he rebuked Britain’s prime minister for objecting to his retweets of a British fringe group’s inflammatory anti-Muslim videos.

The president has also been telling associates he is no longer sure that it’s his voice on the infamous “Access Hollywood” recording that he apologized for during his presidential campaign. Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican, is planning to give a speech on the Senate floor attacking the president’s disregard for the truth.

And a trip to Singapore reminds Abbie Kozolchyk of that most important of all travel maxims — call your mother.","At one point, Kassabova comes across a fortuneteller who answers her secret, unasked question. “What you have begun you will complete,” the woman, reading a handful of tossed beans, assures her, “but you must heed the signs along the way. Never ever ignore the signs.” Luckily for both author and reader, Kassabova seems indeed to have heeded every sign and missed nothing along the way.

LOVE OF COUNTRY: A Journey Through the Hebrides (University of Chicago, $27.50) addresses a homecoming of a different sort. Madeleine Bunting, a Londoner, confesses that “the north-west called to the restlessness in me,” and so she sets out to “zigzag … through the Hebrides out into the blue space on the map. Out to the edge.” Over the course of six years she returns again and again to some of the 270 islands off Scotland’s west coast, and comes to regard these wet, weather-whipped, sparsely populated outcrops as, to quote the Irish Gaelic poet Liam O Muirthile, a kind of “soul territory.”

Photo

Bunting follows in a long tradition of English writers escaping up to the region where the land fractures and frays. To her predecessors, she notes, “the Hebrides offered … an unusual degree of personal freedom from convention and class.” It was on Jura, with a population of fewer than 200, that George Orwell retreated to write “Nineteen Eighty-Four.” Bunting makes a pilgrimage to where he “set up his typewriter in front of the window overlooking the sea, and with that vista in front of him, he infused the novel with a pervasive horror of the dirty, urban tedium of its setting.” Later she reminds us that it was on the wind-battered island of Iona that Irish monks seeking a hermit’s life gave the world the magnificent gift of “The Book of Kells.”

History along this coast, Bunting notes early on, “is unruly, and does not fit into an orderly narrative.” Eventually, though, that history, “mute with trauma,” speaks forcibly to her: “I had encountered multiple types of loss on my journey: of land, language, country and nation.” Her travels culminate in a visit to the Hebrides’ most iconic ruin, St. Kilda. After centuries of habitation, the final 36 residents requested evacuation from this remotest of communities in 1930. For Bunting, the loss still reverberates.

Running under her entire narrative are the feelings Bunting has for her homeland, England, and for the larger entity of Britain. It’s this relationship that’s eventually called into question and cuts deepest. She has justifiable difficulty reconciling, among other injustices, the removal of people from their land at the hands of the Crown during the 18th and 19th centuries: “No other country in Europe witnessed such brutal clearances.” This larger reckoning is what ultimately gives “Love of Country” its power and resonance. After all, what is love — of people, institutions or country — but the attempt to reconcile what cannot be easily reconciled?

The “survival” tale has long occupied a storied corner of the travel writing genre, from “The Worst Journey in the World,” Apsley Cherry-Garrard’s classic recounting of Scott’s 1910 Antarctic expedition, to Nathaniel Philbrick’s history of the whaling disaster that inspired “Moby-Dick,” “In the Heart of the Sea.” Holly FitzGerald’s RUTHLESS RIVER: Love and Survival by Raft on the Amazon’s Relentless Madre de Dios (Vintage, paper, $16) instantly takes its spot among these giants.

The story picks up in the early 1970s in the midst of the long South American “dream honeymoon” of FitzGerald and her new husband, Fitz. That they survive a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle, then escape a penal colony, only sets the stage for their real troubles.

Making their way to freedom in the backwater of Puerto Maldonado, the couple learn that they’re stranded. It’s then that a mysterious, well-dressed stranger approaches their table at a local restaurant. “I can’t help but overhear your difficulty,” he begins. The man, who turns out to be a gold prospector, suggests they use a raft and float the five days downriver to Riberalta, gateway to points beyond. “No harm can come to you,” he insists.

Initially they dismiss the man’s plan as crazy. But the prospect of no exit emboldens the pair. So they find a sturdy raft, made from four logs lashed together, and construct a tent of plastic sheeting atop it. “If you stay in the middle of the river,” they’re advised, “you’ll get there faster.” They are also cautioned under no circumstances to go for a swim. Why? Because “the candiru,” a minuscule saw-toothed fish, “swim up your butt and latch onto your intestines, suck your blood until you die.” Armed with this knowledge and little else, they set out in high spirits. “The river was faster than a galloping horse,” FitzGerald writes. “We joked about which of us was Huck Finn.”

Trouble arrives that first night. Unable to steer the raft in the powerful current, they miss the border checkpoint into Bolivia and shots tear through the darkness into their makeshift tent. But soon the days and nights are blissful. “I don’t know when I’ve ever felt so liberated,” FitzGerald recalls.

Photo

Then, on the fourth night, a drenching lightning storm hits. A tree collapses on the raft, missing FitzGerald’s head by inches. They almost sink in the tempest but manage to escape. Dawn brings the discovery that their raft has been taken far off course — they’re stranded deep in a swamp that rises during the rainy season. Worse, their supply of food has been lost.

In this world of water, the FitzGeralds struggle in vain to find their way back to the river’s current. They endure fire ants, suffer sunstroke and nearly drown in sucking mud. They sleep in a tree. Fear of attack by caiman, jaguar and piranha is constant. Strange glowing eyes peer at them nightly from the jungle. Bees swarm over every inch of their bodies — something they become nearly immune to.

And they starve, for page after harrowing page, for 26 days, until they are come upon — near death, emaciated — by two Indians out hunting for turtles. The couple endure, maintaining hope and affection for each other. It’s this that elevates “Ruthless River” above the typically heroic tale of survival. In simple, unsentimental terms, Holly FitzGerald has given us a most unlikely love story.

Love is just one of the things on the minds of the writers whose stories appear in THE BEST WOMEN’S TRAVEL WRITING, Volume 11: True Stories From Around the World (Travelers’ Tales, paper, $19.95). For more than 20 years, Travelers’ Tales has been publishing books that might best be described as the literary equivalent of a group of travelers sitting around a dim cafe, sipping pints or prosecco and trading their best stories. With more than a hundred titles currently in print, this publisher has carved out a valuable niche in the travel world.

The latest book’s editor, Lavinia Spalding, hungry for travelers who “go with an open heart” and have “the inclination to practice human kindness, a sincere intention to build pathways of understanding and a willingness to be transformed,” read nearly 500 submissions before settling on the 31 stories that make up this diverse collection.

In the opener, Zora O’Neill finds herself drawn away from a resort’s placid blue waters and toward the newly formed refugee camps that have sprung up on the Greek island she and her family visit every year. Like so many of the stories here, “On the Migrant Trail” is told with simple grace. O’Neill’s account demonstrates once again that history’s first draft is often written by the intrepid traveler.

In a different vein, Samantha Schoech offers a hilarious yet ultimately disquieting yarn about spending a week in Venice — sans children and husband — with a gal pal and having perhaps too fine a time. Pam Mandel, in a poignant essay, deals with grief in — of all places — Waikiki. And a trip to Singapore reminds Abbie Kozolchyk of that most important of all travel maxims — call your mother. In story after story, the refreshing absence of bluster and bravado, coupled with the optimism necessary for bold travel, create a unifying narrative that testifies to the personal value and cultural import of leaving the perceived safety of home and setting out into the wider world.

In NOURISHED: A Memoir of Food, Faith, and Enduring Love (With Recipes) (Convergent, $26), Lia Huber, a food writer and recipe developer, leaves the “meat-and-potatoes” safety of her Midwestern upbringing and sets out on a quixotic path of self-discovery.

Photo

As a young woman, she is led by her hunger for enlightenment to the island of Corfu. There she falls in love for the first time — not only with a man but, after an epiphany at the sight of an egg fried in olive oil, with the deep pleasures of good food simply prepared. Upon her return to America, health problems force her further in the direction of conscious eating, and her fate is sealed at a San Francisco farmers’ market “one Saturday morning in spring when a farmer held out a pea to me and changed my world.”

Huber is prone to such pronouncements and the reader might be excused for slipping into cynicism, except for Huber’s wholehearted belief in her path. Finding her soul mate, Christopher, she sets out to make a career of her ardor for food. Passion carries the day over pragmatism and the two — victims of wanderlust — are off to Costa Rica, Paris, Guatemala, Italy, even Minnesota. Eventually Huber meets a man who might be called — to slip into the parlance of this charming foodie’s travel memoir — her guardian angel, the chef Bruce Aidells, who magically appears at key moments and helps Huber land a job as a recipe tester.

Although Huber wears her zeal and her spiritual beliefs on her sleeve as she moves from one inspiration to the next, she’s endearing, engaging company and the reader roots for her success. Eventually Huber and Christopher adopt a baby, victories begin to accumulate, and the three approach a happy ending that Huber knows is merely another new beginning in her larger journey.

Finally, in THE ROMANCE OF ELSEWHERE (Counterpoint, $26), the South African-born Lynn Freed offers nearly two dozen essays from a life influenced by the road. A traveler deep down in her soul, Freed says her “dreams of displacement” began “in childhood.” As a young mother, she even became a travel agent in order to hide from her family her need for escape.

“There has always been romance in distance,” she reminds us. Yet it’s the push-pull of the desire to leave coupled with the “strong attachment to the comfort, the privacy, the intimacy, and the pride of home” that has shaped Freed’s life. “The rhythm of leaving and returning has kept me nicely unsettled for over 45 years.” Without it, she confesses, “I would have drowned any desire to write in restlessness and despair.”

Freed approaches the world — and her prose — with the cleareyed, forthright wonder required of the most committed of travelers. In the essay “Keeping Watch,” she recalls growing up “luxurious but not rich, safe and yet threatened, carefree if one did not think too carefully about the future,” in apartheid-era South Africa, and of her childhood terrors at the prospect of a “Knife-at-the-Throat day” when the servants might “rise as one.”

Elsewhere she speaks eloquently of travel’s power to transform: “The traveling writer is someone seeking … a sort of non-existence, the quest for which can lead, paradoxically, to the discovery of the self set free from the bafflement of context.” And in the deceptively economic essay called “Locked In,” she reminds us just how perilous it sometimes is to be a woman in the world, no matter how seemingly placid the setting.

Freed is also one of the funniest writers around. And in “Useful Zulu Phrases, 1986,” the laugh gets caught in the throat as she offers a hilarious list of some of the helpful hints that were once offered white South Africans attempting to learn Zulu in order to better command and control their black servants. In “Caveat Viator,” she gives us a blistering, bone-true indictment of new age man’s self-aggrandizing struggles to be at harmony with the natural world — from Northern California to Africa.

In this marvelous collection’s final essay, “When Enough Is Enough,” Freed may be speaking for road warriors everywhere when she confesses to the occasional urge to “flee the things and the people that seem to hold me in place, to grab what’s left of the life and make a run for it.”",Travel Books Take You There and Back,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/books/review/travel-writing-women-border-kapka-kassabova.html

In the game, a DESTROYER has two units (or X’s when they’ve been HIT), so the answer we write in is CONAN THE XX.

I stared at that for a long time before I realized that the answer wasn’t 2X or TWENTY. In fact, I had to solve all the way down to the BATTLESHIP revealer at 60A — “It’s four units long in a popular board game (with the game’s other pieces hinted at by the circled letters)” — before I understood what I was aiming for, so to speak. Once I realized that all the circled squares needed X’s, it made the solve much easier.

One other thing I liked about this puzzle was the skill Mr. Charlson showed in filling his grid. Trying to fill cleanly around all of those X’s (especially with them being so close together) is not for the faint of heart. I think he succeeded, don’t you?

Kudos to Mr. Charlson for a fun take on this board game, and for debuting SUBMARINE SANDWICH. And kudos to the editors for the “Grinder” clue.

Tricky Clues

25A: I loved this clue. “Early form of airmail?” had me searching my brain, but I eventually came up with CARRIER PIGEON. Of course, there’s always the African swallow:

42A: “Butters up?” is also a term for flattering someone, but today — given our recent American Thanksgiving — we are supposed to be thinking about the word BASTES.

9D: He’s not wrong. “Congress” and SEX are synonyms. And I will leave it at that.

13D: Remember, it’s Thursday, so if you are thinking that a clue might mean one thing and none of your answers fit, try thinking about whether the clue could have a different meaning. “Giving heat?” could mean pressuring someone or coming down hard on them, but with that question mark, we are thinking of “heat” as slang for a weapon. That’s why the answer is ARMING.

Constructor Notes

The core concept behind today’s puzzle has been seen before, but I wondered if there was a new spin I could put on the idea. Perhaps, I thought, the squares themselves, rather than a letter sequence, could replace the word they represent. Still, this was just a thought — I couldn’t believe my luck when I discovered not only that DESTROYER, CRUISER, SUBMARINE and CARRIER could all be incorporated into lively, nonnautical-related entries, but also that along with BATTLESHIP as a revealer, these entries could be arranged symmetrically when their respective boat names were replaced with the number of squares corresponding to the boat’s length in Battleship! I briefly considered placing a HIT rebus in each of these squares, but decided on X’s to represent hits instead, figuring that I could only push my luck so far, and it doesn’t hurt that I have a soft spot for the high value Scrabble letters. In designing and filling the grid, I started with the upper region, deploying my black squares to best accommodate the seven X’s. Again, to my surprise, I got far better fill here than I expected — I’d like to give a shout-out to Pope JOHN X for his much-needed assistance. Interestingly enough, the bottom right was the toughest section to fill cleanly, despite the lack of X’s. Overall, though, I think this turned out pretty well, and am glad I could incorporate some long bonus fill like “JUKEBOX HERO” and LOOSE CANNON, and some nice mid-length fill in LIKE SO and ROOMBA. I was pleased to see that my favorite clue of mine, “Early form of airmail?” for CARRIER PIGEON, made the cut, and I like the opacity of Will and Joel’s clue “Grinder” for SUBMARINE SANDWICH. Given its proximity to 17-Across, I thought it might be fun to clue BOOR as “Barbarian,” but that didn’t end up making it into the final version. Finally, a note on circles. Although I wonder if the circled squares might give away the game a bit too easily for some, if they allow a mind-bending theme like this one to become accessible to more solvers, then I think they’re a good thing. On that note, I hope everyone enjoys the puzzle!

The letter’s signers, who include the well-known artist and art historian Deborah Willis and the art critic and theoretician Hal Foster, argue that the monuments and markers honor figures who represent a variety of racist views and practices.

“The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight.
“I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said.","When Kwasi Boyd-Bouldin and his family migrated to Hollywood in 1980, they found a neighborhood of short brick apartment buildings, strip mall laundromats and liquor stores with bars on the windows and doors.

They had escaped from New York to California the romantic way, by train, three kids in their tweens and teens. They had fled Brownsville, Brooklyn, at a time the New York City was broke and dirty and crawling with mobsters.

Change was necessary. Also, Kwasi’s father had moved to Hollywood shortly after he was born. If they were going to have a relationship — and his mother wanted them to — they would have to live nearby. That this lead them to the land of endless sun and countless movie stars made the move seem charmed, even magical.

Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, now 40, grew up on the streets of a humble neighborhood in Los Angeles that would eventually go bad. It would even claim one of his sisters during the crack era. But he still loved Hollywood. As a near-native, he rolled through the sun-bleached streets on his skateboard, taking in the scenery. He picked up his first camera, an Olympus Pen-F half-frame his dad left him, at 23, a trained observer of his cityscape. He’d studied the alleys and avenues, the angles of buildings against the sky, like Jane Goodall studied lowland gorillas.

These days, when he is not at his day job (as an education technology specialist at a Pasadena art school), Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who is married and has two daughters, is haunting the streets of his youth. “The Los Angeles Recordings,” his continuing documentary profile of his adopted hometown, serves as a visual introduction to his Hollywood, as he likes to say, among other fond places.

He began the project two years ago in reaction to the head-turning physical changes in the landscape that gentrification brought to the city — the same story playing out in cities across the country, from Seattle to Philadelphia.

The Los Angeles Recordings include photo essays from “South of the 10 Freeway,” “The Liquor Store,” “The Displacement Engine” and other aspects of a city transforming faster than generations of working-class and lower-middle-class residents can handle.

There is no glitz here; no glamour peeking from behind the palm trees against the short, squat locksmith or the auto body shop.

In part, he says, the project is his intention to document a vanishing L.A. Few who live outside it even know exists. He wants “to present a portrait of the city that reflects the lives of people who live in Los Angeles, as opposed to the glossy fictional version that dominates the mainstream narrative.”

“People are just being priced out, and the speed in which it is happening is unbelievable,” said Mr. Boyd-Bouldin, who currently lives in Toluca Lake, a neighborhood near Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley.

“Visually,” he said, “the landscape of the area is being transformed as well because many of the complexes being erected are so large they completely alter the skyline.

Most, if not all, of the complexes being built cater to the affluent, so they are unattainable to the people they are displacing.”

For his Hollywood portrait, the landscapes are stripped of clutter — for the most part, he leaves people out of the frame. In his Hollywood, short, square cinder box buildings with signs for muffler repair, locksmiths, cobblers, and the iconic liquor store are recorded for posterity like the last of endangered species. He eschews the easy shot, the construction cranes behind the vacant lots where aging apartments once stood. Mr. Boyd-Bouldin’s portrait is of an old familial Hollywood that is here today but may be gone tomorrow. The sun-washed skies and lonely streets give some images a dreamy, faraway tone.

As he describes them: “From an outside perspective, some may see only vacant lots and other signs of urban decay. But it’s important to take a more critical look at these areas.”

What he is trying to do, he says, is to not only document the transformation but to provide insight into the impact these changes have had on the city. To what end, he is not sure. “The Los Angeles Recordings” have no end in sight. “I feel like I will always be documenting Los Angeles and Hollywood in general,” he said. “It’s the city and place that made me who I am today.”

A younger sister also died, and Ms. Finlay and Ms. Montgomery, the only survivors, were separated and raised by aunts in their hometown, Pittsburg, Tex.

After high school, Ms. Finlay moved to St. Louis and in 1941 began a correspondence with her future husband, Augustine Finlay, who was in the Navy. They stayed in touch through letters during World War II while Mr. Finlay, of the Bronx, was deployed at Guantánamo Bay, a naval base then used for postal operations and anti-submarine warfare training.

They met in person when she came to New York in 1947, and they married two years later, settling in Brooklyn. A newly divorced Ms. Montgomery followed her sister to New York in 1952, bringing along her daughter.

Ms. Finlay worked at a manufacturing company for two decades, a job that outlasted her marriage. (The couple divorced in 1961.) She took a job as a companion to the elderly for a couple of years, but when a friend asked if she wanted to run the restaurant, the opportunity piqued her interest.

The sisters, then in their 50s, bought the luncheonette and ran it for the better part of a decade. Ms. Finlay said they closed after crime rose in the neighborhood “and we were afraid to be in the business alone.”

The space is now Dean Street Cafe, a kosher coffee shop that roasts beans in house and serves $3 espresso shots and artisanal sandwiches starting at $6. The owner, Zalmy Mochkin, opened the shop in January.

“The diner in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s was the backbone of America’s food culture. I’m trying to bring back the history of the place,” Mr. Mochkin, 27, said. “We want to contribute to what’s here.”

After the restaurant closed, Ms. Finlay embarked on three decades of volunteering. Testaments to her service line the walls of her apartment in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, where Ms. Finlay has lived for 35 years. She volunteered with the Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Flatbush, and with the Lions Club International. She received the Radiant Star of Paradise Award from the Order of the Eastern Star, which the group called “a token of our love and appreciation for her dedicated excellence in service,” in 2004; a distinguished service award from the 42nd Assembly District Community Democratic Club in 2006; and a certificate of merit from the New York State Assembly for community service in 2007.

The awards taper off after that. In spring 2009, she fell while walking on her street, breaking a finger. She then contacted JASA, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, to request housekeeping services.

Ms. Finlay, who lives on $1,193 in Social Security benefits and $149 in food stamps each month, also has glaucoma, edema and borderline diabetes. She is now receiving 20 hours of home-care services and seven prepared meals each week from JASA. In May, JASA put $75 from the Neediest Cases Fund toward her electric and gas bills.

After hearing Ms. Finlay’s story, Mr. Mochkin said he would like to raise money through the cafe for his predecessor. “This is about love and connecting people,” he said.

Ms. Finlay relishes old photographs. Framed memories of her family crowd the tops of furniture around her home, and albums are stacked on shelves. When her home health aide, Jennifer King, was unable to locate a particular portrait of Ms. Montgomery, Ms. Finlay pulled herself up and navigated the room in jolted steps, her legs bent from muscle weakness. She dipped deeply, steadying herself on a nearby table, then pointed to a lower shelf with her cane.

The desired album in hand, she returned to her seat. She combed through it, skimming the photographs, a slight smile on her face. There was a trip to California in 1955 with her ex-husband. There were family reunions back in Texas. There was her sister’s daughter, with whom she speaks several times a week by phone.

One frayed, sepia-toned photograph depicts Ms. Montgomery, who died in 2014 after a mild stroke at the age of 92. The photo shows a much younger woman wearing high heels and a plaid skirt, her feet crossed and her hands folded in her lap.

That fall, he applied for an unpaid position at KCSB, the radio station of the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a host, Hannity was quick to test boundaries, to jab at what he regarded as the liberal pieties of the student body. After just a few months on the air, he invited onto his program a Lutheran minister named Gene Antonio, who contended that the government was hiding the truth about the AIDS crisis. “First of all, the rectum is designed to expel feces, not take in a penis, and so what happens is the body rebels against that,” Antonio told Hannity, explaining his theory of why gay men were prone to various diseases.

In a later broadcast, Hannity took a call from Jody May-Chang, the host of a KCSB show called “Gay and Lesbian Perspectives.” Hannity asked if it was true that May-Chang had a child with another woman. It was, May-Chang said. Hannity shot back that he felt sorry for the kid. “I think anyone that believes, anyone listening to this show that believes homosexuality is just a normal lifestyle has been brainwashed,” Hannity concluded.

Richard Flacks, then the station’s faculty adviser, says that “it was this specific moment when he deals with Jody that was something more than repulsive speech.” After the studio took the young host off the air, Hannity contacted a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union and successfully petitioned the university for a second chance. Then, in an act of characteristic bravado, he called for a public apology and an extra hour on the air every day. He was turned down.

Hannity told me his removal was “deserved”; in retrospect, he said, his statements were “ignorant and embarrassing.” His views on same-sex marriage, he stressed, were now “libertarian,” and he has gay friends. But it was the start of a pattern that would repeat throughout his radio and TV career: Poke, prod, provoke, step back and do it all over again. Bill Dunnavant, Hannity’s boss at his first professional radio gig, in Huntsville, Ala., recalled turning on the radio one afternoon and hearing Hannity engaging in a contentious live interview with the madam of a Nevada brothel. Dunnavant told me he pulled over at the nearest pay phone. “Don’t you ever do that again!” he shouted at Hannity. “This is a family station.”

Hannity told me, “You know, the only way to be successful — it took me a little while to figure it out — is you’ve got to be yourself on the radio.” His ratings slowly improved, and in 1992, he accepted a job at WGST in Atlanta, one of the largest markets in the south. At WGST, he alternated condemnation of the White House-bound Bill Clinton, an early Hannity bête noire, with lighter fare, like a one-off April Fools’ Day segment in which he prodded young callers to vow not to engage in premarital sex. He also began periodically traveling to New York to appear as a political commentator on daytime programs hosted by Phil Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael. The segments were short, but the camera liked Hannity’s blocky features and his forceful delivery.

In 1996, Hannity’s agent, David Limbaugh, got word of a new cable network being funded by the Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Limbaugh had an inside line — the network’s head, Roger Ailes, had helped start his brother Rush’s television show. He suggested Hannity apply.

A few hours later, Hannity was in Ailes’s office in New York. Their conversation was short and straightforward: “Roger goes, ‘Great, you’re going to do a debate show,’ ” Hannity remembers. “And that’s all it took. My life changed forever.”

Hannity’s program was given the all-important 9 p.m. slot at Fox News, but through the summer of 1996, as the network edged closer to its debut, the show still had no co-host. Ailes brought in a range of options, including Joe Conason, a seasoned investigative reporter who was then the executive editor of and a liberal columnist for The New York Observer. Conason did a screen test but was never asked back; eventually, the job went to the mild-mannered Alan Colmes. (Colmes died in February of lymphoma.) “I came to the conclusion that Roger wanted a handsome, smart conservative on one side and a nerdy liberal on the other,” says Patrick Halpin, a commentator and frequent guest on “Hannity & Colmes.” “Alan, God rest his soul, was smart and knowledgeable, but he wasn’t Joe, who would’ve been too strong for Hannity.”

For his producer, Hannity proposed Bill Shine, whom he met while subbing in as a host on a short-lived cable network called NewsTalk Television. “The worst thing you can do to Sean Hannity,” Shine told me, “is remind him of his first day.” Hannity was stiff and “petrified,” in his own recollection, prone to tensing up in front of the camera. At one point, Hannity and Shine ran into each other in a parking garage on 48th Street, near the Fox headquarters. Shine asked Hannity if he thought the show would last five years. “Five years would be great,” Hannity said.

In 1997, Hannity took a nighttime radio slot at WABC — the show went into national syndication the day before the 9/11 attacks — and learned to use the radio program as a workshop for television. On WABC, he could afford to float new ideas, test new lines of attack. By the next day, in time for the start of “Hannity & Colmes,” the material had been sharpened and refined into talking points he could fire at his Fox audience. It was in this manner — percussively, repeatedly — that he helped bolster the case for an invasion of Iraq and chipped away at Republican support for a bipartisan 2007 path-to-citizenship bill that later perished in the United States Senate.

When Colmes left “Hannity & Colmes” in 2009, the program was rebranded as just “Hannity,” and dressed up in American-flag-inspired graphics. Hannity credits Ailes for sticking with him long enough to see him prosper on television. The Fox C.E.O., Hannity told me, “was a father figure,” and in 2016, Hannity vociferously defended his boss in the face of sexual-harassment allegations. (With Hannity, as with Trump, loyalty is paramount, and although he and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly have not always gotten along, “Hannity” was O’Reilly’s first stop at the network after being fired from Fox this year in response to allegations of sexual harassment.)

“Sean definitely led the ‘Come on, guys, we can’t let our boss go down’ group,” Geraldo Rivera told me. “But Sean is also the one who ultimately said to me, ‘From what I’ve seen and heard, some of the allegations are true.’ ” Hannity told me of Ailes: “You know, sometimes people are complicated in life, sometimes it’s not black and white. Some of the most brilliant people I have met in my life — something I don’t have to worry about; I consider myself pretty average — the most brilliant people, often their blessing can be their curse. Do I believe everything that was said? No. Do I think maybe some of it is true? Maybe.” He added, “But if you assume for a second some of it was true, that’s a side of him I never knew, never saw.”

As a broadcaster, Hannity has thrived as a champion of insurrection. In the early 1990s, he rose to regional prominence as a staunch backer of Gingrich’s crusade to wrest control of Congress from the Democrats; after joining WABC in 1997, he rode the Monica Lewinsky scandal to the top of the New York talk-radio charts. And in 2009, he threw his support behind the Tea Party, a movement that inspired his early support for Trump. He became cable TV’s most ardent booster of the movement, giving ample airtime to various Tea Party figures and broadcasting his television and radio programs from a Tea Party rally in downtown Atlanta. “It was exciting,” Hannity recalls. “There was so much energy, and they were talking about all the [expletive] I’d been talking about for years: Small government, lower taxes.”

Hannity’s overt backing of the Tea Party was not unique at Fox News. But he wasn’t just backing the movement on air: He was also participating in fund-raising activities and allowing his image to be attached to promotional mailers for groups like the Tea Party Patriots, which was also an advertiser on his radio show. And occasionally he pushed into fringier terrain, as when in 2011 he aired a television interview with Trump, then toying with running for president the following year, during Trump’s crusade to force President Obama to release his birth certificate. Obama, Trump said, “could have easily have come from Kenya, or someplace.”

“The issue could go away in a minute,” Hannity interjected. “Just show the certificate.”

At least publicly, Ailes did not always seem comfortable with Hannity’s association with the Tea Party, and in 2010, he forbade Hannity to tape his Fox show from the stage of a Tea Party fund-raiser in Ohio. (Hannity says he was unaware that the group had charged for tickets.) But according to a source at Fox News, Ailes’s private reaction was considerably more measured: “Look, Roger was smart — he knew how much money was being generated by the opinion-side guys versus the news-side guys.” Hannity was called into Ailes’s office and sent on his way with a promise not to involve the show in any future fund-raising gigs.

The success of the Tea Party movement, Hannity told me recently, made him certain that if Obama-era Democratic rule were going to be toppled, it would not be with more establishment Republican politics. In 2015, after observing Mitt Romney’s sound thumping in the previous presidential election, he decided to fly around the country to secure the first interview with Republican contenders, preferably immediately after each one announced. He chartered flights himself, spending almost a million dollars in travel expenses. He saw it as “an investment in the business.”

“I’d take friends, my staff, whatever,” he told me. “I’d always fill the seats.” He gravitated early to the Tea Party favorite, Ted Cruz. “But then I’d go to a Trump rally,” he told me. “You only had to open your eyes and see the enthusiasm.”

Among Hannity’s critics, his relationship with Trump is frequently depicted as nakedly and sycophantically transactional — one career entertainer grabbing onto the coattails of another and hanging on for dear life. But people close to the president and Hannity say this caricature vastly oversimplifies the complicated and evolving alliance between the two men and misunderstands the degree to which Trump, as candidate and president, has come to Hannity’s positions, rather than the other way around.

“A big part of how Trump gauges how things are going is how they play out on television in particular,” a Trump campaign official told me. And long before he began his presidential bid in the lobby of Trump Tower in June 2015, Trump was a frequent viewer of “Hannity.” “From that first trip down the escalator at Trump Tower,” the official went on, “Trump was able to literally speak like he was on ‘Hannity.’ ”

As the primaries gave way to the general election, Hannity and Trump’s campaign staff were in touch on an almost-daily basis. “Occasionally, we’d talk on Sean’s show knowing Trump was watching,” Gingrich told me. “The two most effective ways of communicating with Trump are ‘Fox & Friends’ and ‘Hannity.’ ”

John Gomez, Hannity’s old friend, who traveled with him on several legs of his Republican primary tour, recalled that Hannity saw something of himself in the president. “Sean knows that there’s nothing better in radio than that shocking moment, that moment that freezes you,” Gomez told me. Trump did what other politicians wouldn’t. “They’re afraid to state a controversial point. That bugs Sean.”

Bill Shine told me that when it came to the opinion side of the Fox News operation, Hannity was “early on, pretty [much] first” when it came to vocal support of Trump. This put the host at odds with a sizable portion of the Fox News brass, along with Rupert Murdoch, who, according to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, had advised Ailes to “tilt to anyone but Trump,” even if that anyone was Hillary Clinton. The vehemently anti-Clinton Hannity was not about to let that happen. (Ailes, after leaving Fox News, later joined the Trump campaign as a debate adviser.)

Hannity spoke directly to Trump during the campaign. “I was a little bit of a liaison,” he says, between the Trump camp and Fox News. In August 2015, Hannity’s colleague Megyn Kelly asked Trump at a Fox News-sponsored debate to account for his derogatory comments about women. “I say this just very objectively: I thought the question was patently unfair,” Hannity told me. In “Devil’s Bargain,” his book on Bannon and Trump, the Bloomberg Businessweek correspondent Joshua Green writes that Trump phoned Hannity the weekend after the debate, threatening to boycott Fox. Shortly thereafter, he tweeted: “Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy & assures me that ‘Trump’ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews.”

Kelly has since decamped to NBC, but the fissures exposed during the 2016 campaign have widened. “Back in the day, Roger had this saying: ‘You don’t piss inside the tent,’ ” a longtime Fox employee told me. But since Ailes’s death, in May, news-side stars have sniped publicly at hosts like Hannity. In November, Shepard Smith used his afternoon show to throw cold water on the theory — one given extensive airtime by Hannity — that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, orchestrated a sale of uranium to Russia in exchange for a donation to the Clinton Foundation. (Through a spokeswoman, Smith denied he’d been referring to Hannity, and said he and Hannity “respected one another’s roles at the channel.”) And Chris Wallace, the veteran anchor, recently complained, in comments widely seen as directed at Hannity, about some of his colleagues’ propensity for attacking the rest of the media. “Bad form,” Wallace told The Associated Press.

The problem for Fox News is that while Hannity has risen to become the top ratings-earner of the nightly lineup, he is also a figure prone to barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism. And Fox executives frequently have been forced to juggle advertiser discontent with the need to ensure that Hannity, does not leave for a rival network, like Sinclair Broadcast Group, a right-leaning owner of local TV stations.

In November, Alvin Chang, a writer for Vox, crunched data from two years of Hannity TV transcripts and concluded that Hannity was, in his mentions of topics like “the deep state” and the uranium deal, the media’s “top conspiracy theorist.” In our conversations, Hannity rejected the label, calling it a “typical left-wing attack. My whole career I’ve pursued the truth and have been proven right time after time while my colleagues are often dead wrong.” And to watch Hannity regularly is to observe how distant the host is from a figure like the Infowars proprietor Alex Jones. Jones endorses theories; Hannity almost never does, leaving that job to his guests. It is a dance that has the effect of nourishing the more wild-eyed beliefs of his fans while providing Hannity a degree of plausible deniability.

This approach was on full display during the 2016 election, when Hannity invited a doctor to analyze Hillary Clinton’s health on the basis of video footage. (“That looks like violent, out of control movements on her part,” Hannity suggested hopefully.) And it was most infamously evident in his coverage of the case of Seth Rich, a young staff member at the Democratic National Committee murdered in July 2016, in what Washington police say was a street robbery gone bad. But others, like the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, soon began suggesting that Rich had been killed in retaliation for the leaking of sensitive internal D.N.C. emails. This February, a prominent Trump supporter, Ed Butowsky, offered to bankroll a former Washington homicide detective and Fox News contributor named Rod Wheeler to look into the case; according to court documents in a continuing federal lawsuit brought by Wheeler, he and Butowsky later met with Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary, and briefed him on the story.

For Hannity, Wheeler’s investigation did double duty as drama and political cudgel: If Rich was involved in the leaks, then the contention that Russia had undertaken the hack on behalf of Trump would be discredited. And on May 16, he invited Wheeler onto “Hannity.” “Is there any evidence,” Hannity asked, that Rich “might have been disgruntled by the treatment of Bernie Sanders and the unfairness, and that the fix was in, to put Hillary in that position” as the Democratic presidential candidate, “and maybe had evidence of that?” Wheeler demurred, but said that his investigation had uncovered proof that Rich was “having problems” at the D.N.C. “So connect the dots here,” Wheeler suggested. (In his lawsuit, Wheeler claims that the Trump administration and Fox News conspired to push the Rich story on air. Butowsky denies many allegations within the lawsuit and has filed a motion to have it dismissed.)

After Rich’s family demanded an apology and a retraction from Fox News, Hannity stopped mentioning Rich on the air, and he declined to discuss the case directly with me. But he has also tweeted that he is still looking into the circumstances of Rich’s death: “Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever. Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder. Updates when available.” He visited Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, and he told me that he has continued to exchange messages with Kim Dotcom, a New Zealand-based fugitive internet entrepreneur and another proponent of the Rich-as-D.N.C.-leaker story. “There is a much deeper story yet to be heard,” he said.

Hannity’s intransigence is Trumpian in its effectiveness: By backing off on reporting on Fox News about Rich, but maintaining his contention that there “is something going on,” he is effectively having it both ways. At least until a killer is found, he will never have to admit he is wrong. And Trump will continue to be the beneficiary.

One Sunday evening this fall, Hannity sat in the back room of Chris & Tony’s, an Italian restaurant in a strip mall off Jericho Turnpike, in Syosset, a Long Island town. Hannity visits Chris & Tony’s regularly, and he ordered without looking at the menu — baked clams, Kobe beef meatballs, a cheese-covered dish he informed me was known as Heroin Chicken. He poked at the meat hesitantly. At 55, Hannity is increasingly worried about his weight; he recently switched to light beer, and he has upped the frequency of his workouts with his martial-arts trainer, Glenn Rubin.

“We have days we call ‘keeping it real,’ ” he said. “And keeping it real is like this guy who’s so big and so strong, and he’s coming up to me all throughout an hour-and-15-minute session and putting me in chokeholds, seeing how I respond to a gun to my head. You know, how do I deal with blades? And then another day is pain day, and then literally you put out your arms, ‘Boom, boom, boom.’ ” He mimed a hammer-punching motion against his forearm and stomach. “It’s made me stronger than I’ve ever been in my life.”

A waiter appeared with two more pints of beer. When he left, Hannity gestured toward him. “I’m no different to all the service businesses,” he said. It was a theme he returned to frequently, his enduring fixation on consumer demand — what made people angry or happy, what turned them on or off. Hannity, who was recently inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, told me he continues to pay for his own focus-group surveys of his radio and television shows: What he seems to fear more than anything else is the prospect of a fan picking up the remote.

For now, he has little to worry about. During the Moore scandal, he ascended to the top of the cable-news ratings heap. In the weeks after our first meeting, I kept in close touch with Hannity by text. As John Gomez, Hannity’s longtime friend, had warned me, Hannity appears to be constitutionally unable not to answer his phone, and the messages often arrived at night — “asleep at 11 p.m.?” read one chiding text — or even on commercial breaks from his television show.

Sometimes, Hannity would preview segments to me, offering the broad arguments that he would refine and repeat that night. “Remember trump lost VA and NJ. No shock,” he texted after Republican losses in races for governor in those states; that night on the air, he repeated the words almost verbatim. “Massive boomerang coming back on Dems on Russia,” he texted before a segment on the purported uranium deal; a few days later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s office announced it would consider appointing a special counsel to look into the supposed deal. The influence obviously thrilled him, as did the reactions it could provoke. “I say it,” he texted, “and it’s gone. Then liberals bubble and fizz and give off steam like Alka-Seltzer in water.”

In October, Hannity flew to Middletown, Pa., to interview Trump in advance of a rally to gin up support for tax reform. Sitting inches from the president, Hannity covered the biggest issues of the day, serving as rudder and prompt — steering Trump gently to friendly terrain. The new tax cuts, Trump said, would be “massive”; working-class Pennsylvanians were “incredible”; health care reform would be “great”; and Democratic policies were “terrible,” an adjective the president went on to apply to Colin Kaepernick, the education system and the urban crime rate.

Hannity, smiling solicitously throughout, let the roar of the crowd stand in for his response.

“I will say this,” Trump told his friend, before leaving the stage. “You have been so great. And I’m very proud of you.”",How Far Will Sean Hannity Go?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/how-far-will-sean-hannity-go.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

That is more calls than for all of last year (29,919), and more than three times the number in 2012 (10,492).

On one recent day, the fire department received 173 snake invasion calls, versus five fire alarms. “There’s no way we could survive if there were more fires than snakes,” said Prayul Krongyos, the department’s deputy director.

The department’s figures don’t even include the many thousands of snakes that are killed or removed by residents on their own or taken from homes by volunteer handlers.

Most of the snakes rescued by firefighters are taken to a wildlife center and eventually released in the wild.

Mr. Prayul and the department are nowhere near panic. One reason for the rising numbers is growing public awareness that firefighters can help remove snakes and other animals.

It has also been a wet year, even by Bangkok standards. Heavy rains bring a surge in the number of snakes seeking refuge indoors. Flooding can turn city streets into snake highways as the creatures are forced from their hiding places and swim for higher ground.

And as the sprawling city of more than 8.2 million people continues to expand into formerly wild lands, the number of snake encounters is rising. Most of the snake removal calls come from neighborhoods on the perimeter of the city where new housing is destroying what’s left of the creatures’ domain, Mr. Prayul explained.

“When people build houses in their habitat, of course they will seek a dry spot in people’s houses because they can’t go anywhere else,” he said.

All reasonable explanations. But casual discussion tends to end when it’s your toilet the snake is in.

“There are snakes everywhere!” said Kanok Praditkranok, Ms. Panarat’s husband. “They live beneath people’s houses, they live in holes, they live in the wilderness and in the ground. But they shouldn’t be able to enter people’s houses.”

The reality, though, is that humans cause snakes much more harm than the other way around.

Thailand has more than 200 snake species, including about three dozen that are venomous. But most do not pose a threat to people.

“Stories of snakes invading homes always sound scary, but as long as you don’t provoke them, they won’t hurt you,” Mr. Prayul said. “There are only a few cases where snakes come into people’s houses and hurt them.”

In Bangkok, where garbage bags often pile up on sidewalks awaiting collection, snakes perform a public service by catching rats and other vermin.

“Snakes are among the most misunderstood animals in the world,” said Nonn Panitvong, a leading expert in biodiversity. “People are afraid of snakes and don’t take time to identify them. In Thailand, they just kill the snakes.”

To keep the animals from being needlessly slaughtered, Mr. Nonn helped set up the “Snake at Home” message group on the popular Line phone app. People who encounter a snake can send a photo to the group’s volunteer experts and get an immediate reply on whether it is venomous.

“We can give them instant answers so maybe the snake will live,” said Mr. Nonn, who in August was named Thailand’s first ASEAN Biodiversity Hero, a new award created by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to honor conservation advocates.

Started this year, Snake at Home has 29,000 followers and receives nearly 30 identification requests a day.

The identification service also has helped save a number of humans.

Doctors make more than half the identification requests in the hope of learning whether a snake that bit a patient was venomous and, if so, which species, so they can use the correct antivenin.

“In Thailand, homes continue to expand into the natural environment, so there will be always more snakes in the homes,” Mr. Nonn said.

After the second python appeared in Ms. Panarat’s toilet, the family discovered that the soil under their five-year-old house had subsided and that there was an opening in the sewage pipe large enough for a big snake to enter.

The family fixed the problem and has not seen a python since.

Despite the widespread fear of snakes in Thailand, an encounter with one is considered by many to be a sign of good luck.

Ms. Panarat, who told her story on Facebook and posted photos of the captured snake, received half a dozen inquiries from people asking for her house number so they could use it when buying lottery tickets.

One relative wrote on her page, “There’s an old saying that if you encounter a snake, you will meet your soul mate.”

Ms. Panarat jokingly replied, “I’d rather be a widow.”","Lurking in Toilets, Swimming the Streets: Snakes of Bangkok Move In",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/world/asia/bangkok-snakes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

And though it includes some interpolations from latter-day pop, it is also surprisingly true to the spirit of its 19th-century creators. (I say this with the sad authority of someone who appeared in a college production of “Pirates.”)

That means this show delivers period satire with a thorough appreciation of its artful, evergreen absurdity. To relish that sensibility, you do not have to be familiar with what’s being made mock of here: the hidebound institutions of parliament and the navy, the pieties of Victorian sentimentality and Italian operas in which improbably intricate plots were matched by the ornateness of the score.

An antic exuberance is built into the form and content of Gilbert and Sullivan shows. And the ensemble here, which doubles as its own band, channels that spirit with an infectious blitheness that requires no footnotes.

In a fleet 80 minutes (including a one-minute intermission), the show unpacks the tale of young Freddy (Shawn Pfautsch), an apprentice to a team of inept pirates who is just about to turn 21, when he will be free of his indentures. But there are complications, as there always are in 19th-century opera, involving divided allegiances and accidents of birth.

Photo

These come to the surface when the dunes of Penzance are invaded by a squadron of dewy, gaily tripping maidens. They are the daughters of the Major-General (Matt Kahler), a military bigwig who is ultimately as talentless as Freddy’s mentor, the tenderhearted Pirate King (Robert McLean).

Though Freddy owes much to the smitten Ruth (Christine Stulik), the maternal crone who delivered him as a wee lad to the pirates, he immediately falls for the Major-General’s daughter Mabel, who has a knockout soprano voice. Mabel is also played by Ms. Stulik, who changes costumes faster than Superman and wields a cadenza the way an ace rock guitarist weaponizes power chords.

As the performers deliver this labyrinthine plot — playing guitar, accordion, banjo, saw and violin all the while — they move purposefully among the audience, gently displacing those who happen to be in their way. (The choreography by Katie Spelman is witty, but the cast members must think as well as dance on their feet.)

In any case, you are sure to feel a joyful complicity with what’s occurring onstage, especially as Mr. Kahler’s wonderful, Monty Python-esque Major-General gropes for rhymes to fill out his fabled signature patter song. (You know, “I am the very model …”)

His outfit, by the way, is to die for — a combination of a long-tailed white jacket, matching Bermuda shorts and a pink lace shirt that might have been snatched off a Paris runway. The inspired costumes, which include fetching tiered tutus and Necco Wafer-colored bathing caps for his daughters, are by Alison Siple.

The music director, Andra Velis Simon, ensures that you never miss the presence of an orchestra. And Heather Gilbert did the essential pastel lighting, which when necessary plunges the show into a deep lavender twilight.

One of those blushing purple moments arrives for an invocation to the lyric spirit. “Hail, poetry,” sings the ensemble, as it files in silhouette across the boardwalk.

While the cast members, with a few exceptions, have displayed merely adequate voices up to this point, as a choir (aided by Kevin O’Donnell’s sound design) they suddenly sound truly heavenly.

“It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience — these are our core principles,” the ABC statement said. “We fell far short of that yesterday.”

Kathleen Culver, the director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the mistake would give fresh ammunition to Mr. Trump and other conservatives who have attacked the credibility of news organizations, especially those that have reported negatively on the administration.

“This error plays right into the hands of people who callously try to say that news media all just lie,” Ms. Culver said in an interview on Saturday night. “This is the kind of thing you can see being brought up again and again and again at appearances by the president, where he will take one situation in which something was wrong, and blow that out into a condemnation that all news media are fake.”

Hours after ABC’s statement, Mr. Trump used Twitter to praise the network for suspending Mr. Ross, calling his report “horrendously inaccurate and dishonest.” The president ended his tweet by referring to “Fake News.”

Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter that the error was the latest in a series of high-profile mistakes by Mr. Ross.

“I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong,” Mr. Fleischer wrote, in reference to a 2001 report in which he said Mr. Ross inaccurately linked Iraq and its dictator Saddam Hussein to an anthrax attack on the United States. “Brian Ross went with it anyway.”

In 2012, Mr. Ross and ABC issued an apology after Mr. Ross incorrectly suggested that the shooter in the massacre at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater was involved with a Tea Party organization.

While Ms. Culver said the network’s decision to suspend Mr. Ross was an appropriate first step, she said the mistake should also prompt a wider assessment by ABC of his record, as well as a more general evaluation across the media industry of the push for speed, which likely contributed to the error.

“We are at a time when public trust in news media is so low that we have to work constantly to try to rebuild that trust,” she said. “And every time practices go awry like this, we do damage to that trust.

“The fact that she’s in the Trump administration has not helped the parent choice,” said Mr. Fuller, the Marquette professor.
“I think the president continues to lead in an important direction in our country,” Ms. DeVos said.","Funding requests for private school vouchers and charter schools that Ms. DeVos said would jump-start “the most ambitious expansion of education choice in our nation’s history” have largely been ignored by Congress. A tax-credit scholarship program, like the one Mr. Bush expanded in Florida, was supposed to go national — but has not taken flight.

The one proposal that has made some progress, an expansion of tax-favored 529 savings plans in the Republican tax overhaul to allow families to put away savings for private school tuition, has divided conservatives, some of whom say the expansion will not reach the low-income families that the school choice movement was created for. The beneficiaries would be families with money to sock away at the end of the month.

“The best and worst thing she’s done has electrified the conversation, and the fact that she had everybody coming for her from Day 1 shows what’s at stake,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the advocacy group 50CAN, or the 50-State Campaign for Achievement Now. “But not as much has gotten done as we would like, and certainly what we wanted to get accomplished legislatively and thought would happen right away is not happening.”

Among choice advocates, Ms. DeVos still appeared to have broad support, and some of her allies blamed deep, divisive partisanship for her shortcomings.

“I don’t think people are giving her a real chance inside or outside the department,” said Robert Enlow, the president of the advocacy group EdChoice. “Ideology and partisanship has really gotten in the way.”

But most echoed Jack McCarthy, who runs an AppleTree early learning center and charter school in Washington.

He said Ms. DeVos’s principles were not unlike others that he had heard from former secretaries of education, including her immediate predecessors, Arne Duncan and John B. King Jr., who supported charter schools. But their boss, Barack Obama, was not the polarizing figure Mr. Trump is in the education community.

“The difference is the president,” Mr. McCarthy said. “She’s facing the general backlash to whoever is in a leadership position in that administration. And that’s a shame.”

Ms. DeVos, who sat on the board of Mr. Bush’s foundation and contributed to his failed 2016 presidential campaign, used her first address to the group as secretary to assure her audience that she had not been deterred.

“Allow me to borrow a line from the great American author Mark Twain: The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,” she said, calling out “unions, union bosses, the defenders of the status quo, the education-expert bloggers and muckrakers, and many of our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle in Congress.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” she said. “In fact, I’m just getting started.”

Mr. Bush called her the “epitome of a principled reformer who puts kids first.”

In an interview, Mr. Bush — who during the campaign called Mr. Trump “a chaos candidate” who would become “a chaos president” — acknowledged that Ms. DeVos had limited power and was operating in a “hyperpartisan environment.” He said he expected that she would leave her mark in some legislative effort.

“That hasn’t happened yet, but not much has happened,” Mr. Bush said. “I don’t blame her for that. This has been a period of adjustment, and I think she’s done a great job in changing who’s important.”

Mr. Bush said that Ms. DeVos’s real battle was not in Washington and that she had focused her attention in the right places: in the states, building coalitions to garner support for school choice policies that will ultimately be up to states to put in place.

Still, in her remarks to the crowd of nearly 1,000, Ms. DeVos signaled her impatience.

“We are at a time for choosing,” Ms. DeVos said. “We can choose to turn away, to offer platitudes or promises of action next year. Or we can say: no more. No more empty rhetoric, no more folding to political pressure, no more accepting by inaction this fundamental injustice that stains the future of the greatest republic in the history of the world. No more.”

But education policy experts say they see little Ms. DeVos can accomplish. The administration’s deregulatory push and support of the Every Student Succeeds Act, a new federal law that pushes most decision-making to states, leave her department weakened.

“She wasn’t set up to have power. She was set up to reverse everything,” said Chris Stewart, the chief executive of Wayfinder Foundation and a longtime education activist who moderated a panel of parents at the convention. “She has a bully pulpit, but you can’t get much done talking.”

Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, said Ms. DeVos’s strong messaging could sometimes be off-putting, especially at a time when personal attacks are a common retort of the administration.

“I see a lot of coming out swinging at the teachers union, but it turns off people like me to not hear her talk about the limitations to choice,” Ms. Lake said. “If the plan is to just rally the base and asserting that choice is the answer, they’re not going to move things.”

Ms. DeVos’s obligation to carry out the administration’s deregulation agenda has been among the biggest challenges for the choice movement, many here said.

She has repealed guidance issued to states by the Obama administration on matters of civil rights that has been criticized by conservatives as federal overreach. She also delayed carrying out regulations designed to protect student borrowers, especially low-income students, that critics say are too broad and punitive.

“A lot of the regulatory changes that are happening in the office don’t seem to be coming from the person that I did state advocacy with like five or six years ago,” Mr. Bradford said. “The president’s administration’s a complicated one that has lots of people doing things they wouldn’t naturally do.”

And across the country, advocates are having a hard time reconciling Ms. DeVos’s philosophical and political affiliations.

“The fact that she’s in the Trump administration has not helped the parent choice,” said Mr. Fuller, the Marquette professor. “People who are on the ground, one of the things we now have to fight is guilt by association with Donald Trump.”

At a Murfreesboro, Tenn., high school the day before her keynote address, Ms. DeVos offered a rare admonition from a cabinet member on Mr. Trump’s language.

But currently, Ms. Tifrere, 38, is committed to ArtLeadHER, an organization she created that is dedicated to promoting women artists. In addition to organizing shows, including “King Woman,” an exhibition of 25 contemporary women artists currently on view through Dec. 9 at Pen + Brush in the Flatiron district, Ms. Tifrere gets involved in the business side of art, helping women artists sell their works to her collector friends, who include the singer/songwriter Maxwell and the basketball player Carmelo Anthony. Ms. Tifrere splits her time between a home in Fort Lee, N.J., where she has her own modern art collection, and a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea. She lives with her son, Kasseem Dean Jr., 10, and their dog, Chloe. Most Sundays, mother and son avoid the suburbs and roam the city.

ELEVATE We wake up kind of late on Sundays. I’ll get up at around 9:30. Kasseem will sleep until 10. Then we get up and we walk the High Line. We both really love the High Line. It’s so peaceful up there, you kind of forget you’re in New York City. Sometimes we head downtown to the meatpacking district and have breakfast at Serafina. Or we’ll go to the Standard Grill. He keeps it simple — he’s a pancake guy. Myself, I’m going to get lobster hash, like lobster benedict. I’ll also have my Sunday bellini.

HEEL FLIPS, HIGH ART Kasseem takes his skateboard almost everywhere. After we’ve had our breakfast-brunch, we’ll head back up to Pier 62 Skate Park, near Chelsea Piers. It’s a huge park. It’s got all the dips and, like, those big pools and all these different interesting obstacles. So while he’s doing that I’m sitting on the lawn with my laptop, just relaxing. By the time he’s done it’s like 2 or 3 o’clock, and we’re back on the High Line. We stop and check out the art up there. The High Line has been great about giving space to artists.

POP LIFE Kasseem knows my business is art, so he’ll accompany me to check out the galleries on Sundays. We head down to the Village. I know a lot of the gallery owners in the area, like we’re very close to the Martin Lawrence Galleries family. My son and I both love it there because they have a lot of artists that are superanimated. The colors are bright, and there’s superhero characters, and Kasseem can relate to that. So it’s good because I like to take him places where he can relate to the art. On the way home, we’ll look at street art. Kasseem loves it, and there’s a ton of it down in the Village, so we’ll spend some time checking that out before we go home.

SHOP AND COOK If we’re not too exhausted by that point in the afternoon we’ll go get some things for dinner. We’re both really healthy. Kasseem is definitely being raised as a modern-day eater. When we go home we start prepping. I’ve been teaching him how to cook. We’ll wash everything and he’ll start cutting the vegetables. Things he likes, like broccoli. He also loves pasta, and he loves fresh Parmesan, so I’ve been teaching him how to grate it and boil the water for the pasta. Everything he makes has to have truffle salt included. I tell him, You’ve got some exquisite taste for a 10-year-old. I don’t know what I’ve started here.

WORK, WITH WINE CHASER Dinner usually begins around 7, and his bedtime is 9 o’clock, so I let him indulge in a little TV or whatever he wants to do after we eat. Sometimes he wants to play a board game, like Trouble, so we’ll do that. Mostly he’s off in his own little world until he falls asleep. But Sunday night for me is when the work begins. Once he’s off to bed, I have to get out the laptop and get started on the week ahead. I get out my folders and get back into my conversations with artists all over the world. I probably shut everything down by midnight, so I can get a solid six hours sleep before Monday. But I definitely have my little glass of wine on Sunday nights. That helps me burn the midnight oil.","How Mashonda Tifrere, Art and Hip-Hop Maven, Spends Her Sundays",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/nyregion/how-mashonda-tifrere-art-and-hip-hop-maven-spends-her-sundays.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A.I. works by taking large volumes of information and distilling it down to simple concepts, categories and rules and then predicting future responses and outcomes. This is a function of the beliefs, assumptions and capabilities of the people who do the coding. A.I. learns by repetition and association, and all of that is based on the information we — humans who hold all the racial and often, specifically, anti-black biases of our society — feed it.

Just think of how Google’s facial recognition programs labeled black people in photos “gorillas.” Or how Microsoft’s Tay, a bot designed to engage in Twitter conversations, devolved into a racial-epithet-tweeting machine within 24 hours.

These downsides of A.I. are no secret. Despite this, state and local law enforcement agencies have begun to use predictive policing applications fueled by A.I. like HunchLab, which combines historical crime data, moon phases, location, census data and even professional sports team schedules to predict when and where crime will occur and even who’s likely to commit or be a victim of certain crimes.

The problem with historical crime data is that it’s based upon policing practices that already disproportionately home in on blacks, Latinos, and those who live in low-income areas.

If the police have discriminated in the past, predictive technology reinforces and perpetuates the problem, sending more officers after people who we know are already targeted and unfairly treated, given recent evidence like the Justice Department’s reports on Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, and the findings of the San Francisco Blue Ribbon Panel on Transparency Accountability and Fairness in Law Enforcement.

It’s no wonder criminologists have raised red flags about the self-fulfilling nature of using historical crime data.

This hits close to home. An October 2016 study by the Human Rights Data Analysis Group concluded that if the Oakland Police Department used its 2010 record of drug-crimes information as the basis of an algorithm to guide policing, the department “would have dispatched officers almost exclusively to lower-income, minority neighborhoods,” despite the fact that public-health-based estimates suggest that drug use is much more widespread, taking place in many other parts of the city where my family and I live.

Those “lower-income, minority neighborhoods” contain the barbershop where I take my son for his monthly haircut and our favorite hoagie shop. Would I let him run ahead of me if I knew that simply setting foot on those sidewalks would make him more likely to be seen as a criminal in the eyes of the law?

The risks are even more acute (and unavoidable) for those who can afford to live only in the neighborhoods that A.I. would most likely lead officers to focus on.

There’s yet another opportunity for racial bias to infuse the process when risk-assessment algorithms created by A.I. and machine learning are used to help to sentence criminals, as they already are in courts around the country.

Without a commitment to ensure that the data being used to fuel A.I. doesn’t replicate historical racism, biases will be built into the foundation of many “intelligent” systems shaping how we live. It’s not that I want this technology to be rejected. There are ways to make A.I. work. But before it is used in law enforcement, it must be thoroughly tested and proven not to disproportionately harm communities of color.

Until then my excitement about advances in tech will always be cautious. Innovation is at the core of the careers that allow me and my husband to provide a good life for our family.

JAY-Z That's who I — that's who I am.
I don't know if he's had the level of — I mean, I had to survive by my instincts.","My conversation with Jay-Z began with O.J. When I was a kid growing up in black New Orleans in the 1960s, O.J. Simpson was a god. We imitated his moves, his swagger. We didn’t want to just play like him. We wanted to be him, gorgeous and running in the California sun. We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American, clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as “The Great One.” We were triumphant when he won it the next year. But O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote. So when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his song “The Story of O.J.,” from his most recent album, “4:44,” in which he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line “I’m not black, I’m O.J.” I was less engaged by the rapper’s marital troubles or his infamous, caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self — a black man who grew up in the ’70s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn. It seemed from his new body of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had been stirring more deeply within him — much the way it stirs in me, a Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for me. What is it about the story of O.J. Simpson that moved us both? O.J. must have locked down part of himself when he presented himself as the noncontroversial star who never talked about race, the perfect foil for his fellow football player, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, who seemed more threatening, angry. I had to wonder if the pressure of that denial caused him to explode decades later. All of this was on my mind when I met with Jay-Z for two hours in an executive office at The Times this past September. Besides O.J. and racial identity, we talked about his mother’s sexuality, and how he could possibly raise socially aware children who shuttled between mansions: After years of rapping about growing up in the ‘hood, he has produced an album that sounds like a middle-aged black man’s deeply introspective therapy session put to music.

This interview has been edited and condensed. Annotations by Wesley Morris, critic at large for The New York Times, and Reggie Ugwu, pop culture reporter for The New York Times.

DEAN BAQUETFirst, welcome.

JAY-ZThank you.

BAQUET The things I want to talk to you about: I want to talk a little bit about race. Your music some, too. I thought the song [""The Story of O.J.,"" from the album ""4:44,"" 2017] was particularly powerful. I took the message as, ""You can be rich, you can be poor, you're still black."" Who were you speaking to? Who did you want to listen to that and be moved by it?

JAY-Z It's a nuanced song, you know. It's like, I'm specifically speaking to us. And about who we are and how do you maintain the sense of self while pushing it forward and holding us to have a responsibility for our actions. Because in America, it is what it is. And there's a solution for us: If we had a power base together, it would be a much different conversation than me having a conversation by myself and trying to change America by myself. If I come with 40 million people, there's a different conversation, right? It's just how it works. I can effect change and get whomever in office because this many people, we're all on the same page. Right? So the conversation is, like, ""I'm not rich, I'm O.J."" For us to get in that space and then disconnect from the culture. That's how it starts. This is what happens. And then you know what happens? You're on your own, and you see how that turned out.

BAQUET Was it a reminder, too, that the thing O.J. forgot, maybe, was that as rich as he was, as entitled as his life was, he was reminded very forcefully when he became a subject of racial debate that he was also a black man, whether he accepted that or not?

JAY-Z That's right. Absolutely. And for us, like I'm saying, to speak to that the point is, ""Don't forget that,"" because that's really not the goal. The goal is not to be successful and famous. That's not the goal. The goal is, if you have a specific God-given ability, is to live your life out through that. One. And two, we have a responsibility to push the conversation forward until we're all equal. Till we're all equal in this place. Because until everyone's free, no one's free, and that's just a fact.

BAQUET When you're as amazingly successful as you are, your kids will live in a very different world from the world you grew up in. How do you go about making sure that they understand the world you grew up in?

JAY-Z There's a delicate balance to that, right? Because you have to educate your children on the world as it exists today and how it got to that space, but my child doesn't need the same tools that I needed growing up. I needed certain tools to survive my area that my child doesn't need. They're growing up in a different environment.1 But also they have to know their history. Have a sense of what it took to get to this place. And have compassion for others. The most important thing I think out of all this is to teach compassion and to identify with everyone's struggle and to know these people made these sacrifices for us to be where we are and to push that forward — for us. I believe that's the most important thing to show them, because they don't have to know things that I knew growing up. Like being tough.

1Reggie Ugwu: Jay-Z anticipated this dilemma on the 2011 song "" Jay-Z anticipated this dilemma on the 2011 song "" New Day "" from the album "" Watch the Throne ,"" in which he and Kanye West both address verses to their future sons. In Jay's verse, he raps: ""Took me 26 years just to find my path / My only job is cut the time in half."" (Jay-Z's son, Sir, and his twin sister, Rumi, were born last June . His eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, is 5.)

BAQUET Do you worry at all that as much as you will teach them history, and as much as you yourself are seen as an important figure among black people in America, that there's something they'll be missing? Or do you think that's silly, [that] in fact they'll have so many advantages that that's too negative of a way to approach it?

JAY-Z Exactly. Like, they'll be who they are, right? And it's just certain tools that you would hope for your child to have. You know, like, again, fairness and compassion and empathy and a loving heart. And those things translate in any environment. Those are the main base things that you want — well, for me, I would want my child to have. You know? Treat people as they are, no matter who they are, no matter where they sit in the world, not to, like, be super nice to someone at a high position or mean to someone who they've deemed to be below them. I can't buy you love, I can't show it to you. I can show you affection and I can, you know, I can express love, but I can't put it in your hand. I can't put compassion in your hand. I can't show you that. So the most beautiful things are things that are invisible. That's where the important things lie.

BAQUET For me as a black man of a certain age, when I was a kid O.J. Simpson was God. I'm 61, so I was a little kid when he was [around]. Do you expect black people and white people and young people and old people to hear different things in your music? I'm sure I heard some things in that song that you may not even have thought of 'cause I'm a different generation. What do you want a young white kid to hear in that song that maybe a young black kid would not hear?

JAY-Z That's a great question. I think when you make music, you want people to hear different things, and then you want it to start a dialogue. Because that's how we get to understanding. ""Oh, you felt that way about it."" ""This is actually what I meant, because this happened, and these things happened, that led to me saying this specific thing.""

BAQUET How did you react when that one line in that song where you referred to Jews and wealth2 [""You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it""] — some people got upset. How did you feel about that?

2Reggie Ugwu: A representative of the Anti-Defamation League A representative of the Anti-Defamation League told Rolling Stone , ""the lyric does seem to play into deep-seated anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews and money.""

JAY-Z I felt it was really hypocritical. Only because it's obvious the song is, like, ""Do you want to be rich? Do what people got rich done."" Of course, it's a general statement, right? It's obviously a general statement, like the video attached to it was a general statement. And if you didn't have a problem with the general statement I made about black people, and people eating watermelon and things like that [the animated music video for the song, which references racist cartoons, includes a caricature of a black man eating watermelon] — if that was fine, [but] that line about wealth bothered you, then that's very hypocritical, and, you know, that's something within yourself. 'Cause basically, I was saying, you know, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, is a great basketball player. He trains in the off-season. If you want to be great, train in off-season like him. That's basically the statement. You can't miss the context of the song. You have to be like 5 years old or something.

BAQUET Some people think that the election of Donald Trump has revived the debate about race in America. Some people think that, in fact, there's always been racism in America; that it hasn't changed and that the debate isn't any different. It's just people are paying attention to it. What do you think?

JAY-Z Yeah, there was a great Kanye West line in one of [his] songs: ""Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it."" [""Never Let Me Down,"" from West's 2004 album, ""The College Dropout.""] Take a step back. I think when Donald Sterling3 got kicked out of the N.B.A., I thought it was a misstep, because when you kick someone out, of course he's done wrong, right? But you also send everyone else back in hiding. People talk like that. They talk like that. Let's deal with that.

3Reggie Ugwu: In 2014, Sterling, then owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was In 2014, Sterling, then owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was banned for life from the N.B.A. after a recording emerged in which he made racist comments about black people to a female friend.

I wouldn’t just, like, leave him alone. It should have been some sort of penalties. He could have lost some draft picks. But getting rid of him just made everyone else go back into hiding, and now we can’t have the dialogue. The great thing about Donald Trump being president is now we’re forced to have the dialogue. Now we’re having the conversation on the large scale; he’s provided the platform for us to have the conversation.

BAQUET And you think that's better? That we should be having a conversation?

JAY-Z Absolutely. That's why this is happening.

BAQUET Do you think the debate over race in America is happening in a healthy way?

JAY-Z Well, an ideal way is to have a president that says, ""I'm open to dialogue and fixing this."" That's ideal. But it's still happening in a good way, because you can't have a solution until you start dealing with the problem: What you reveal, you heal.

BAQUET Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

JAY-Z Right? If I have like a tumor, and I don't know it, it doesn't mean it goes away. I have to diagnose it first. No matter how it happens. If I get hit with a football, and, like, Oh, I feel something there, and then I go to the doctor — it still happened.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z You know what I'm saying? So however it happens, we're just getting hit with a lot of footballs. To use [an] analogy that goes next to the N.F.L.

BAQUET If you were an owner, you would sign Colin Kaepernick, right?

JAY-Z Yeah. I dedicated ""The Story of O.J."" to him at the Meadows concert.4

4Wesley Morris: Ah, Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, whose protest against racism and racial inequality in America might be the most incendiary act of political umbrage since Ah, Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, whose protest against racism and racial inequality in America might be the most incendiary act of political umbrage since Kanye West declared , at a 2005 national telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina, that George W. Bush ""doesn't care about black people."" Kaepernick's decision last year to take a knee during the performance of the national anthem has since been adopted by dozens of other athletes. The president's outrage at the protests and the ensuing debate have upstaged the injustice Kaepernick knelt against. In October, after several months without being signed to a team, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the N.F.L. accusing the owners of collusion against him. So there's an apt sting in dedicating ""The Story of O.J."" to him, since he's now taking a hit for being agreeable, race-blind O.J. Simpson's opposite.

BAQUET Have you met him?

JAY-Z No. We just had dialogue over the phone, but we supposed to get together.

BAQUET Do you have any doubt that if this had not happened, he would be signed by a team?

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah. Of course.

BAQUET Do you think basketball is more politically active than football?

JAY-Z Yeah.

BAQUET Why is that?

JAY-Z I think because, first of all, it's smaller numbers. It's 12 people on a team. In football you have 53 people. So it's harder to get 53 people thinking the same thing. It's easier to have a conversation to get 12 people on the same page. For one. Two, [the N.B.A. has] a great ... they have a great commissioner5 who's really open. And, you know, supports them. And you feel that. You feel like, you know, when you have someone behind you that really believe in what's right, it motivates you to do the right thing. I think those two factors show why they're much further along.

5Wesley Morris: Adam Silver is the current, generally beloved N.B.A. commissioner. He has yet to drastically stifle expressions of political empathy by teams or individual players. (Let's see what happens should a player defy his expectation that all N.B.A. players Adam Silver is the current, generally beloved N.B.A. commissioner. He has yet to drastically stifle expressions of political empathy by teams or individual players. (Let's see what happens should a player defy his expectation that all N.B.A. players stand during the anthem .) Silver has merrily ridden for the last two years on the N.B.A. float in New York City's gay pride parade. He oversaw the expulsion of the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who could never have remained in the league — his continued presence might have torn it apart. Ridding basketball of Sterling started as many conversations about the sort of open-carry racism we're currently living with as keeping him around would have. One thing that makes Silver a great commissioner is that he understands that.

BAQUET Are there incidents even at this stage in your life — you're famous, you're rich, you own stuff — where you run into racism that's evident to you, that's easy to recognize?

JAY-Z Yeah. Yes. Yeah. But it mostly comes when you try to challenge the status quo.

If I’m being quiet and entertaining, everyone’s cool. Ah man, it’s great. You don’t feel racism. But when you try to challenge the club, it’s like, Oh, nah, we should have a seat at — to use the Solange album title — we should have a seat at this table. And then it gets into a space where it’s like, wait, you guys are mad at me about the same thing you guys are doing. It gets into a weird space.

BAQUET Are you in meetings now in your business life6 where you're the only black man in the room?

He is the founder of the entertainment company and record label Roc Nation, owns the champagne brand Armand de Brignac and co-owns the Jay-Z's numerous business ventures — launched in parallel to his prolific music career — created a template for the rapper/mogul.

JAY-Z Well, when I was doing the Nets7, I was definitely the only black guy in the room.

7Reggie Ugwu: Jay-Z acquired a Jay-Z acquired a small minority stake in the New Jersey Nets in 2003. (He sold it in 2013.) He played an influential role in bringing the team to Brooklyn, including helping design the new team logo and jerseys.

BAQUET And what was that like? Describe that.

JAY-Z It was um, it's strange, but at the same time I think that ... I think that in that room, my celebrity allowed me a voice that probably would have been awkward for someone [else] in my position being the only black person in the room to break through.

BAQUET This album [""4:44.""] sounds to me like a therapy session.

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah.

BAQUET Have you been in therapy?

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah.

BAQUET First off, how does Jay-Z find a therapist? Not in the Phone book, right?

JAY-Z No, through great friends of mine. You know. Friends of mine who've been through a lot and, you know, come out on the other side as, like, whole individuals.

BAQUET What was that like, being in therapy? What did you talk about that you had never acknowledged to yourself or talked about?

JAY-Z I grew so much from the experience. But I think the most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a ... you're at such an advantage. You know, you realize that if someone's racist toward you, it ain't about you. It's about their upbringing and what happened to them, and how that led them to this point. You know, most bullies bully. It just happen. Oh, you got bullied as a kid so you trying to bully me. I understand.

And once I understand that, instead of reacting to that with anger, I can provide a softer landing and maybe, “Aw, man, is you O.K.?” I was just saying there was a lot of fights in our neighborhood that started with “What you looking at? Why you looking at me? You looking at me?” And then you realize: “Oh, you think I see you. You’re in this space where you’re hurting, and you think I see you, so you don’t want me to look at you. And you don’t want me to see you.”

BAQUET You think I see your pain.

JAY-Z You don't want me to see your pain. You don't ... So you put on this shell of this tough person that's really willing to fight me and possibly kill me 'cause I looked at you. You know what I'm saying, like, so ... Knowing that and understanding that changes life completely.

BAQUET Was that a moment that came from therapy?

JAY-Z Yeah — just realizing that, oh my goodness, these young men coming from these ... they just in pain.

BAQUET Mm-hmm.

JAY-Z You have to survive. So you go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode what happen? You shut down all emotions. So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect.

BAQUET You can't connect because of the way you feel about yourself, you mean?

JAY-Z Yes. In my case, like it's, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity ...

BAQUET You've bared your soul so much. Not only in this album — you can sort of see the evolution of a person in your music. Part of me would think, Oh my god, I gotta talk about my marriage, I gotta talk about my mother, I gotta talk about my other ancestors. Part of me would think that would make me nuts. Does it make you nuts, or do you feel like the heart of your art is to tell the story of your life?

JAY-Z That's who I — that's who I am. And I've done it from the beginning of my career. Two things: one, no one knew the characters [back then]. So it wasn't as impactful. And two, it wasn't coming from a place where it was as evolved.8 And it's very difficult. It's hard to hear songs back. It's hard to perform ... songs, but, um, I feel it's the most important work that I've done and I'm very proud of it and the effect that it's having on people. Even like the studio sessions, you know, we were having four-hour conversations after playing one song. I learned so much about people that was around me, just my friends, I learned things about them that I didn't know, in a 20-year relationship, just from this one song. So I knew it would have that sort of impact beyond myself. It's my responsibility as an artist to go to these places.

BAQUET But you probably couldn't have gotten away with, O.K., you do the album, wife, that talks about our pain, I'm gonna go do an album that talks about, you know, my love of art.

JAY-Z Yeah, you just, you never know. I think it turned out for the best, but you just never know, because people like to be entertained. Again, back to our president. You would think, Man, after the composed manner in which Obama stood at that podium, the dignity he brought to that place, that this couldn't exist. But it does.

BAQUET Do you have any disappointments in Obama? There are people who say the expectations of him as the first black president were so great: He was supposed to get rid of racism and fix everything. Is that unfair? Did he live up to all of your expectations?

JAY-Z Yes, because all he could do was the best he can do. He's not a superhero. And it's unfair to place unfulfillable expectations on this man just because of his color. You're actually doing the opposite. It's like, what do you think is gonna happen? He's there for eight years. And he has to undo what 43 presidents have done. In eight years. That's not fair.

BAQUET What do you think of the state of — I'm not gonna say just black leadership, but leadership, period, on the things you care about in the country? Who do you, like, look at and say, ""This man or woman speaks for the things I care about?""

JAY-Z [laughs] I find it funny, but ... I like Dave Chappelle's [laughs].

BAQUET [laughs] Go ahead.

JAY-Z You know what I'm saying?

BAQUET You gonna vote for Dave Chappelle for president?

JAY-Z Yeah. 'Cause he tells it in humor so you can deal with it, but it's always a nice chunk of truth in there.

BAQUET Is there a part of you, because you have a certain amount of money, that gets a little more conservative, or has having money9 not changed your politics?

9Reggie Ugwu: I love the politeness in the phrase ""a certain amount of money."" Jay-Z's net worth is an estimated $810 million. He spent most of 2013's "" I love the politeness in the phrase ""a certain amount of money."" Jay-Z's net worth is an estimated $810 million. He spent most of 2013's "" Magna Carta Holy Grail "" both admiring his wealth and wielding it. Being a rich black rapper had put him on the defensive when his strongest creative mode involves the moral costs and social perks of his being self-made. One of the most poignant aspects of the new album is the way he's trying to reconcile what affluence means for him, his family and his race.

JAY-Z No. No, because I believe in people. I want what's best for people. I love people. You know, so I don't have that sort of thing, like, I want to vote Republican just to save more money.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z That's not the endgame. It's not about who got more money and who got more houses. Yes, you know, you've earned it, buy what you want.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z You know? But don't forget what's important. Without people, being rich would be very boring.

BAQUET Right [laughs].

JAY-Z [laughs] No one to share with, no one to have ... You know what I mean? You'd just be a rich person, one person on the planet — just, like, well then what do you do?

BAQUET When I heard this latest album, and then I thought about the earlier albums, one theme was sort of reaching the promised land. You know, you've acquired influence, and not just money, but your life is good. And then when you listen to the newest album, you're thinking: He must have been in a lot of pain when life was good.

JAY-Z Absolutely.

BAQUET Is that true?

JAY-Z Yeah. I did this song called ""Song Cry.""10

10Reggie Ugwu: The song, from Jay-Z’s Grammy-nominated 2001 album “ The song, from Jay-Z’s Grammy-nominated 2001 album “ The Blueprint ,” describes the dissolution of three early relationships and the rapper’s inability to reconcile his emotions and grieve fully, or openly. “Pride won’t let me show it / Pretend to be heroic.”

BAQUET Mm-hmm.

JAY-Z And the idea of the hook — ""never seen it comin' down my eyes, but I gotta make the song cry."" It tells you right there what I was, I was hiding.

The strongest thing a man can do is cry. To expose your feelings, to be vulnerable in front of the world. That’s real strength. You know, you feel like you gotta be this guarded person. That’s not real. It’s fake.

BAQUET Does that mean you were unhappy during that period and didn't have a handle on it, or what?

JAY-Z Well, you compartmentalize, right? So you can be, you can be inside your body and be happy, but at the core of it, something else is going on.

BAQUET As a parent, I thought one of the most painful scenes in the album was when you are talking about having almost lost your marriage, and what it would have been like to watch another man play football with your kid. Given that you have talked so much about your life in your music, are there things that you put a wall around? You've talked about the pain of growing up where you grew up, how you grew up, your father leaving early, the pain of your marriage, being in therapy: Are there things [about which] you say, ""I'm not going there""?

JAY-Z Yeah. And it mostly involves other people 'cause when other people are involved, you may be ready to expose these things, [but] it's also other people truth as well.

A perfect example is my mom. I didn't have permission to do that song first.11 It's just like we had a beautiful conversation.

11Wesley Morris: I'm a sucker for mommy music. The third track on ""4:44"" — ""Smile"" — features Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, and contains this couplet about her: ""Momma had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian."" His rapping here is buttery and exuberant: ""I just wanna see you smile through all the hate / Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake."" So his approach to Gloria manages to exult her and, for anybody annoyed by his ""eat the cake, Anna Mae"" line on Beyoncé's 2013 track "" I'm a sucker for mommy music. The third track on ""4:44"" — ""Smile"" — features Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, and contains this couplet about her: ""Momma had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian.""

So his approach to Gloria manages to exult her and, for anybody annoyed by his ""eat the cake, Anna Mae"" line on Beyoncé's 2013 track "" Drunk in Love ,"" arguably to exonerate him from having cast himself as Ike Turner to Beyoncé's Tina. Anyway, ""Smile"" ends with an inspirational poem that Gloria wrote and recites and that puts the concept of shadows to moving metaphorical use: ""The world is changing and they say it's time to be free / But you live with the fear of just being me / Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be / No harm for them, no harm for me / But life is short, and it's time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed / Smile.""

BAQUET When did you realize your mother was gay?

JAY-Z Uh, really early on when, when I was ...

BAQUET Like as a little kid?

JAY-Z Not, no, not — let's call it teenage years.

BAQUET So you realized that and talked to her about it?

JAY-Z We never spoke about it. We — it just exist. It was there. Everyone knew.

BAQUET Gotcha.

JAY-Z But we never spoke about it. Until, like, recently, now we start having these beautiful conversations, and just really getting to know each other. We were always good friends but now we're really great friends. You know. And we were just talking as friends. And then she was sharing that she was in love. She can be herself [now]. She doesn't have to hide for her kids or feel like she's embarrassing her kids. It was a much different time then. [Now] she can just live her full life, her whole life, and be her.

BAQUET Will this get harder over time? Like, you know, as a young man, your music was the way a lot of young rappers are — it's like, you know, [your music was about] the violent life. If that's chapter one of the autobiography, chapter two of the autobiography — I'm oversimplifying — is like, ""Now I'm really rich. I have a lot of stuff. Let me tell you how cool that is."" And then chapter three of the autobiography is, ""Oh my god, I've run myself into the ground."" So what's chapter four?

JAY-Z No, chapter three is: Oh my goodness, oh, the most beautiful things are not these objects. The most beautiful things are inside. The most beautiful things are the friendships I have. I have really golden friendships. The compassion and the person I've become — that's what this chapter is. You know? And the conversation with my mom. Those are the real enriching experiences.

BAQUET But will you have the same adventures in your life? Will you have the same stuff to write about? Or maybe you don't know.

JAY-Z I think that rap in particular is a young man's sport, that I'll move out of that white-hot space. Rap is about the gift of discovery. The white-hot space is when it's fresh and new, and it's like, this is the hottest song ever. I mean I pushed the window, like —

BAQUET You still — you think you're still in that space?

JAY-Z I stretched it. Oh, I stood in that window a really long time. But still, no, I don't think people are looking to me as like, The Thing.

BAQUET Is that hard to deal with, or did you feel like, I'm O.K. with that, because I've moved on?

JAY-Z No.

BAQUET You don't want to be.

JAY-Z 'Cause I, at the end of the day we gonna find out it's not about the white-hot space, but it's about finding the truth. That white-hot space — people think it's the biggest thing, but it's really small. It's almost like a trend.

Would you rather be a trend, or you rather be Ralph Lauren? You know what I mean; like, you rather be a trend, or you rather be forever?

I’m the person that looked at the Mona Lisa and be like, Man, that’s gonna be cool in 40 years. I play forever. And so my whole thing is to identify with the truth. Not to be the youngest, hottest, new, trendy thing.

BAQUET One of the things you rap about also is the pain you caused the people you sold drugs to.12 Have you ever had conversations with people like that you caused pain to as a young man and talked about it?

12Reggie Ugwu: A motif of Jay-Z's discography is the mutually assured destruction of drug users and drug dealers alike. From "" A motif of Jay-Z's discography is the mutually assured destruction of drug users and drug dealers alike. From "" Can I Live "" on 1996's "" Reasonable Doubt "": ""We hustle out of a sense of hopelessness ... We become addicted / Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'.""

JAY-Z No, I haven't. No.

BAQUET What would you say to them? Or is that impossible to do at this point?

JAY-Z Nothing's impossible. I guess that conversation would definitely take ownership for my part in, um, you know, the part I played in occupying that space. Because knowing what I know now, you know, you can't sacrifice others for your life. There's a karmic debt that has to be paid. Had I had the level of consciousness then that I have now, things would have turned out differently. And just knowing that ... I definitely want everyone to know that.

BAQUET Do black artists have a different obligation than white artists? Do you feel you have a different kind of obligation to the people who listen to you than if you were a white musician?

JAY-Z Yeah, 'cause I have an obligation, going back to the story of O.J., to further conversation of an entire race of people. And to . . . Not me — all of us. But specifically me, since you're asking the question, it's to open up dialogue. [...] It's O.K. to think. It's O.K. to be smart. You know, there was a time when people was like, ""you talkin' white."" It's like, what does that even mean? I know words? Intelligence is not a tribute to color. And I'm sure you've heard it growing up many times.

BAQUET Of course.

JAY-Z ""You speaking white."" Like, what?

BAQUET Yeah. Yeah.

JAY-Z I'm speaking like I know words. And it's O.K., it's fine. You know, so I have an obligation to further the conversation and always, you know, our stature in America. Our emotional maturity. And so on and so forth. It's humbling; at the same time it's like, you know, it's what you've been charged with in life. And I believe since the beginning of time the poets have been charged with that. Like it was the poets that's explaining the emotions and making these songs that people like, ""Oh, that's what I feel.""

BAQUET Are there black artists, and I won't ask you to name them unless you want to, who you think don't live up to that obligation to start a conversation about race? Do you think there are people you wish did more?

JAY-Z Well, I mean, and for one, O.J., right? 'Cause that's the one that we can all identify. There are those who don't uphold their mantle, and we know how that story plays out.

BAQUET What would you say to him if you could talk to him?

JAY-Z I don't know. I would probably say, ""Man, I'm sorry that so much happened to you, man."" You know, people act out in this way based on their life experiences and, you know, I'm sure he's been through a lot of trauma in his life. I think that'll start the conversation.

BAQUET Did you watch the documentary about him?

JAY-Z I watched every one.

BAQUET I did too.

JAY-Z Yeah, there was like eight of them on at the same time.

BAQUET You could read the story of O.J. two ways. You could say it's a reminder of people that they're black. I could read that as a negative message or a positive message. The positive message being: You're black and you should be more proud of it. The negative message is: Who are you kidding? You can't escape this by joining a private country club and playing golf.

JAY-Z Right.

BAQUET Which message feels like the right [one]?

JAY-Z They both, they both dual messages at the same time. It's like, be proud of who you are and realize that we're gonna get further together. Don't check out. You can't just turn your back on the place you come from. You come from a community. Your job is to uplift it now.

BAQUET So now I gotta ask my one gossipy question. Talk about Kanye West and your relationship with him, which you alluded to a little bit in the album.13 When's the last time you talked to him?

13Wesley Morris: It's an allusion to a saga. Together, Jay-Z and Kanye West made the 2011 album ""Watch the Throne,"" which reached an apogee of rap collaboration. The story goes that last year, Jay-Z, through his partnership with Live Nation, gave West $20 million as part of his contract to cover expenses for his Saint Pablo tour. Then, from the stage of that tour in Sacramento, West embarked on a tirade that included shots at, among others, Beyoncé, Mark Zuckerberg and, yes, Jay-Z: ""I've been sent here to give y'all my truth even at the risk of my own life, even at the risk of my own success, my own career. ... Jay-Z — call me, brah. You still ain't called me. ... Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send 'em at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man."" He eventually ended the concert after four songs and, two days later, It's an allusion to a saga.

He eventually ended the concert after four songs and, two days later, checked himself into a hospital for an eight-day stay. So, in response, Jay-Z opens ""4:44"" with "" Kill Jay-Z ,"" nearly three minutes of second-person self-laceration. ""You ain't a saint / This ain't KumbaYe,"" Jay-Z raps. ""But you got hurt because you did cool by Ye / You gave him $20 without blinking / He gave you 20 minutes on stage / [What] was he thinkin'?"" I've been interpreting this as Jay-Z realizing the usefulness of the old business credo advising against mixing business with friendship and blaming himself for ignoring it.

JAY-Z I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he's my brother. I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated relationship with us.

BAQUET Why is it complicated?

JAY-Z 'Cause, you know — Kanye came into this business on my label. So I've always been like his big brother. And we're both entertainers. It's always been like a little underlying competition with your big brother. And we both love and respect each other's art, too. So it's like, we both — everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You know what I'm saying? And then there's like a lot of other factors that play in it. But it's gonna, we gonna always be good.

BAQUET But there's tension now, right?

JAY-Z Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that happens. In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I'm saying? There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ""These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel."" I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. You know what I'm saying? These are — I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.

BAQUET Is he as evolved as you?

JAY-Z He's highly evolved. No, he's ... I think he started out in a more compassionate position than me. You know what I'm saying. I don't know if he's had the level of — I mean, I had to survive by my instincts. I'm here because I grew up a different way. And I got out of that.

You know, my first album came out when I was 26. So I was already a different artist. You know, a lot of people's album come out they're 17, 18. So their subject matter is that of a 17- or 18-year-old. Unless you're Nas, and you like, well-read14... — like, he was way more advanced with the album that he wrote. So I just grew up a different way. But [West is] a very compassionate person. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others. So I can identify with it. It's just that there's certain things that happened that's not really acceptable to me.

14Reggie Ugwu: Recorded when he was still a teenager, Nas's landmark 1994 debut album, ""Illmatic,"" was praised for its vivid, incisive lyrics about coming of age among urban blight. A Queens native and autodidact, he dropped out of school after the eighth grade.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z And we just need to speak about it. But there's genuine love there.

BAQUET I'm trying to picture the scene when you and your wife both talked about making these very confessional, open albums. Was it difficult to say: ""I'm gonna talk about the problems in our marriage. I'm gonna talk about how we almost lost things."" And for her to say: ""I'm gonna talk about my pain and anger at you."" What were those conversations like?

JAY-Z Again, it didn't — it didn't happen in that way. It happened — we were using our art almost like a therapy session. And we started making music together.

And then the music she was making at that time was further along. So her album came out as opposed to the joint album that we were working on. Um, we still have a lot of that music. And this is what it became. There was never a point where it was like, “I’m making this album.” I was right there the entire time.

BAQUET And what was her reaction to your work and what was your reaction to hers? They must have caused pain for each of you, right?

JAY-Z Of course. And both very, very uncomfortable, but [...] the best place in the, you know, hurricane is like in the middle of it.

BAQUET Yeah.

JAY-Z We were sitting in the eye of that hurricane. Uh, maybe not use hurricane because so many people are being affected right now. [This interview took place nine days after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, on the heels of two other devastating hurricanes, Irma and Harvey, that struck the U.S. mainland.]

BAQUET Yeah.

JAY-Z But the best place is right in the middle of the pain.

BAQUET Right.

JAY-Z And that's where we were sitting. And it was uncomfortable. And we had a lot of conversations. You know. [I was] really proud of the music she made, and she was really proud of the art I released. And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a healthy respect for one another's craft. I think she's amazing.

You know, most people walk away, and like divorce rate is like 50 percent or something ’cause most people can’t see themselves. The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone’s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself.

BAQUET Yeah.

JAY-Z So, you know, most people don't want to do that. You don't want to look inside yourself.

BAQUET Yeah.","Jay-Z Discusses Rap, Marriage and Being a Black Man in Trump’s America",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/29/t-magazine/jay-z-dean-baquet-interview.html

The United States has taken pains to refrain from recognizing the Holy City as Israel’s capital precisely to avoid being seen as prejudging the outcome of peace talks, in which Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the seat of their eventual government.

Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, said dispensing with that longstanding reticence would reveal the United States as “so incredibly one-sided and biased” that it “would be the total annihilation of any chances of peace, or any American role in peacemaking.”

“They’re sending a clear message to the world: We’re done,” she said.

While physically moving the embassy would require little more than putting a new sign on existing American consular offices in Jerusalem, Mr. Trump’s declaring Jerusalem the capital would carry great symbolic power, Palestinian officials said.

“If anything, it is worse, actually,” said Nasser al-Kidwa, a member of the central committee of Fatah, the dominant P.L.O. faction, and a nephew of Yasir Arafat, its onetime leader. Recognition matters, he said, “not the stones” of an embassy building.

Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to Ismail Haniya, leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, was similarly critical of Mr. Trump’s expected declaration. “I don’t understand why he wants to antagonize over a billion Muslims around the world,” he said.

The specific way in which Mr. Trump makes his declaration, however, could mean a significantly different response on both sides of the conflict.

If he just refers to “Jerusalem” as Israel’s capital, or refers to the city’s present municipal borders, Mr. Trump would be likely to set off a strong backlash in much of the Arab world, analysts said.

“For Palestinians, this will be perceived as dividing the cake while negotiating over it,” said Ofer Zalzberg, a Jerusalem-based analyst at International Crisis Group.

Ms. Ashrawi warned it could lead to repercussions “that would not be easily contained,” including violence: “To people who are looking for an excuse, this would be a ready-made excuse.”

If Mr. Trump were to limit his statement to West Jerusalem, however, it would likely antagonize supporters in the pro-Israel camp, by undercutting their claim to a united capital throughout the city and acknowledging Palestinian designs on East Jerusalem.

Any attempt at deliberate ambiguity is unlikely to fly because the United States will be forced to specify the territorial definition of Jerusalem that the president was relying upon, said Daniel Shapiro, who was President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Israel.

“It accomplishes so little that I wonder if it’s worth that headache,” he said.

The timing of Mr. Trump’s declaration was baffling both to those who warned against it and some who welcomed it.

Both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are awaiting a proposal by Mr. Trump’s administration to restart the peace process. And recent meetings in Riyadh between Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and, in turn, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, have fueled speculation that Mr. Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed are trying to push through a plan.

Given the prince’s eagerness to combat Iran, Palestinians are concerned he could embrace a proposal unfavorable to them, for an alliance with Israel against Iran.

But Arab governments, even Saudi Arabia’s, could be compelled to rebuke a declaration of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, experts said.

“Pushing this issue now, in advance of a peace process at a time when the administration has zero credibility on this issue, at a time when it wants to engage the Saudis, makes absolutely no sense,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Mideast peace negotiator under past Republican and Democratic administrations. “It’s a self-inflicted wound.”

Perhaps no Arab leader has more at risk in a cementing of Israel’s hold on Jerusalem as its capital than King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose dynasty has defined itself as the custodian of Al Aqsa, a holy site revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount. While the king can fire subordinates who fail him, he is viewed as personally responsible for Al Aqsa, said Mr. Zalzberg, and Mr. Trump’s declaration “could contribute dramatically to the erosion of the king’s popularity and legitimacy.”

Abdullah has been in Washington for more than a week, pressing the administration not to take this step, according to Arab news media. Petra, the Jordanian news agency, said the king had warned that changing the United States’ posture on Jerusalem would threaten a two-state solution and “could be potentially exploited by terrorists to stoke anger, frustration and desperation in order to spread their ideologies.”

Palestinian officials across the political spectrum made similar warnings. In Gaza, Hamas issued a statement calling on Palestinians to “incite an uprising in Jerusalem so that this conspiracy does not pass.” Mr. Yousef, the adviser to the Hamas leader, said Mr. Trump’s move would drive up anti-American sentiment and “decimate whatever good will they have here.”

And a Hamas representative based in Lebanon, Ali Barakeh, said the group would probably respond to Mr. Trump by calling for a new intifada, or uprising, and for Mr. Abbas to quit negotiations, “since the Americans won’t achieve anything for them.”

But Ayman Rigib, a Fatah leader in Cairo, worried aloud that Mr. Abbas would not push back firmly enough. “This is a new low for us as Palestinians,” he said. “We are not only weak, we also have a leader who might actually accept this deal.”

Along the 1967 line in a Jerusalem quieted by the Jewish Sabbath, Hani Juwaihan, 28, one of the relatively few East Jerusalem Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, said he wished Mr. Trump would leave well enough alone.

The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

ELEVATE We wake up kind of late on Sundays. I’ll get up at around 9:30. Kasseem will sleep until 10. Then we get up and we walk the High Line. We both really love the High Line. It’s so peaceful up there, you kind of forget you’re in New York City. Sometimes we head downtown to the meatpacking district and have breakfast at Serafina. Or we’ll go to the Standard Grill. He keeps it simple — he’s a pancake guy. Myself, I’m going to get lobster hash, like lobster benedict. I’ll also have my Sunday bellini.

It’s got all the dips and, like, those big pools and all these different interesting obstacles. So while he’s doing that I’m sitting on the lawn with my laptop, just relaxing. By the time he’s done it’s like 2 or 3 o’clock, and we’re back on the High Line. We stop and check out the art up there. The High Line has been great about giving space to artists.

POP LIFE Kasseem knows my business is art, so he’ll accompany me to check out the galleries on Sundays. We head down to the Village. I know a lot of the gallery owners in the area, like we’re very close to the Martin Lawrence Galleries family. My son and I both love it there because they have a lot of artists that are superanimated. The colors are bright, and there’s superhero characters, and Kasseem can relate to that. So it’s good because I like to take him places where he can relate to the art. On the way home, we’ll look at street art. Kasseem loves it, and there’s a ton of it down in the Village, so we’ll spend some time checking that out before we go home.

SHOP AND COOK If we’re not too exhausted by that point in the afternoon we’ll go get some things for dinner. We’re both really healthy. Kasseem is definitely being raised as a modern-day eater. When we go home we start prepping. I’ve been teaching him how to cook. We’ll wash everything and he’ll start cutting the vegetables. Things he likes, like broccoli. He also loves pasta, and he loves fresh Parmesan, so I’ve been teaching him how to grate it and boil the water for the pasta. Everything he makes has to have truffle salt included. I tell him, You’ve got some exquisite taste for a 10-year-old. I don’t know what I’ve started here.

WORK, WITH WINE CHASER Dinner usually begins around 7, and his bedtime is 9 o’clock, so I let him indulge in a little TV or whatever he wants to do after we eat. Sometimes he wants to play a board game, like Trouble, so we’ll do that. Mostly he’s off in his own little world until he falls asleep. But Sunday night for me is when the work begins. Once he’s off to bed, I have to get out the laptop and get started on the week ahead. I get out my folders and get back into my conversations with artists all over the world. I probably shut everything down by midnight, so I can get a solid six hours sleep before Monday. But I definitely have my little glass of wine on Sunday nights. That helps me burn the midnight oil.","How Mashonda Tifrere, Art and Hip-Hop Maven, Spends Her Sundays",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/nyregion/how-mashonda-tifrere-art-and-hip-hop-maven-spends-her-sundays.html

That proved to be an ever-present challenge when a Belgian photographer, Thomas de Wouters, sought to document a growing youth movement devoted to nonviolence.

When he arrived there a year ago, street clashes had just left more than 50 people dead in the troubled Central African nation after opposition groups protested President Joseph Kabila’s efforts to extend his rule for an unconstitutional third term. Mr. Kabila’s mandate was about to expire, and security forces were deployed to suppress dissent.

“The tension was really high,” said Mr. de Wouters, who had to elude state intelligence services arresting activists. “Everything had to be secure and discreet. For the first five or six days, I just ended up doing clandestine meetings and interviews in different places. I didn’t take any pictures.”

Eventually, he earned the trust of members of the youth group Lutte pour le Changement (Struggle for Change, or LUCHA), a self-declared nonviolent citizens movement formed in 2012 to challenge the existing political disorder in a vast and chaotic nation that has teetered for decades on the brink of collapse.

Brutal Belgian colonists first plundered Congo’s rubber and used slave labor to build railways that have since fallen into disrepair. Then came the kleptocratic dictator Mobutu Sese Seko who bled state coffers dry during his 32-year rule. Over the past two decades, an equally corrupt and dysfunctional government has been locked in conflict with an assortment of militias that split the country into fiefdoms. They live by the gun while battling for control over natural resources, including gold, diamonds and timber. Since 1994, a staggering five million people have died in Congo’s conflict, many of them violently, but most from deprivation, hunger and disease.

Washington has warned President Kabila that Congo must hold long-delayed elections by the end of 2018, or the vote will lose international support.

But Congo’s population long ago lost trust in any level of government or the international community’s ability to untangle Congo’s constant state of disaster despite the world’s largest and most expensive U.N. peacekeeping mission.

Against this backdrop, Mr. de Wouters set about documenting the efforts of LUCHA, one of several grassroots movements that have emerged in West Africa, including Senegal and Burkina Faso. These groups promote civic engagement and youth mobilization and form strategies on how to peacefully challenge the state’s failure to provide basic services like running water, health care, education and security. Social media is an essential tool for spreading ideas and expanding their reach. LUCHA operates as a non-hierarchical, decentralized network of cells, preventing anyone within the movement from becoming too important.

“Normally when that happens to a movement, the government tries to stop them or corrupt them, but this way they can’t,” Mr. de Wouters, 47, said by phone from Brussels.

The photographer was not interested in making the kind of dramatic images that often dominate news coverage from the republic. Instead, he focused on the daily lives of LUCHA members, using square format black and white film to document their meetings, family lives and day jobs in and around the eastern city of Goma, where a handful of activists founded the group five years ago. LUCHA now says it has some 1,000 members, most in their 20s and 30s, in 18 Congolese cities.

Mr. de Wouters’s images show some protest marches and arrests (Slides 4 and 5), but it’s the quieter, mundane moments that linger: a man speaking into a microphone in a broadcast studio; activists sitting around a low table in a storeroom surrounded by sacks; people on the streets collecting water, or in gardens planting vegetables (Slide 6). The timeless quality of the images reflects a country’s almost hopeless struggle to move forward despite a wealth of natural resources and billions of dollars of foreign investment.

Congo has spawned countless “movements” since its independence in 1960, but few have brought anything other than more instability. But for Mr. de Wouters, LUCHA’s commitment to peaceful dialogue represents a generational shift. And their bravery in the face of violent repression and frequent detention without trial offers hope. Ultimately, Mr. de Wouters said, it’s up to the Congolese to find solutions to the country’s complex problems.

“My point is that maybe this is the start of some real change,” he said. “When I see them, I start to believe it’s possible.”

Let’s talk through what has transpired and Senator Sessions’s advice on how to proceed.”

It is not clear how Mr. Dearborn handled the outreach. He forwarded a similar proposal, made through Rick Clay, an advocate for conservative Christian causes, to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a top campaign aide. Mr. Kushner rebuffed the proposal at the time, according to two people who have seen Mr. Kushner’s email.

Mr. Sessions told investigators from the House Intelligence Committee that he did not recall the outreach, according to three people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Dearborn did not return requests for comment, and Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with matters related to the investigations, declined to comment. Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Erickson were not successful.

Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia, on orders from the highest levels of its government, undertook a sophisticated campaign to hack Democratic computers, spread propaganda and undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. The repeated outreach around the N.R.A. convention, where Mr. Trump accepted the group’s endorsement, came just weeks after a self-described intermediary for the Russian government told George Papadopoulos, a campaign aide, that the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. And just weeks later, the president’s eldest son arranged a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the would-be Democratic nominee.

“The Kremlin believes that the only possibility of a true reset in this relationship would be with a new Republican White House,” Mr. Erickson wrote to Mr. Dearborn, adding, “Ever since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.”

Congressional investigators obtained the email as part of their inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether Mr. Trump’s campaign aided the efforts. It appears to have caught the attention of senators as well. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, penned letters to several Trump campaign foreign policy advisers last week asking for all documents related to the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson, Mr. Torshin, Mr. Clay, Mr. Dearborn and others.

Mr. Erickson, a longtime conservative operative who has been involved in several presidential campaigns, presented himself in the email as a well-connected intermediary to the upper reaches of the Russian government. By “happenstance” and the reach of the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson wrote, he had been put in position to “slowly begin cultivating a back-channel to President Putin’s Kremlin” in recent years.

“Russia is quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S. that isn’t forthcoming under the current administration,” he wrote.

Indeed, evidence does appear to show deep ties between Mr. Erickson, the N.R.A. and the Russian gun rights community that were formed in the years when many American conservatives, put off by the Obama administration’s policies, were increasingly looking to Mr. Putin as an example of a strong leader opposing immigration, terrorism and gay rights.

The N.R.A. was one of Mr. Trump’s biggest backers during the campaign, spending tens of millions of dollars to help elect him.

Mr. Erickson has known Maria Butina, a former assistant to Mr. Torshin and the founder of the Right to Bear Arms, a Russian gun-rights group, for several years. Ms. Butina, who helped Mr. Torshin make the request through Mr. Clay, hosted Mr. Erickson at a September 2014 meeting of the group at its Moscow office. And in February 2016, the two incorporated a company, Bridges LLC, together in South Dakota. What the company does is unclear.

In December 2015, Mr. Erickson returned to Russia as part of an N.R.A. delegation that included David Keene, the group’s onetime president, top donors and David A. Clarke Jr., the former sheriff of Milwaukee County who became a popular Trump campaign surrogate. At one stop, the group met with Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister in charge of defense. A photograph from the meeting shows Mr. Torshin was also present.

In the United States, the hospitality was returned. Mr. Torshin and Ms. Butina attended the N.R.A.’s annual convention in 2014 and 2015. Ms. Butina told the conservative news site Townhall that she attended the N.R.A. Women’s Leadership Luncheon as a guest of Sandra S. Froman, a former president of the group. And in 2015, she was given a tour of the N.R.A.’s Virginia headquarters.

Attempts to contact Ms. Butina were unsuccessful.

Mr. Erickson does not explicitly name Mr. Torshin in the email to Mr. Dearborn, but the message appears to refer to him, the people familiar with the communication said. Instead, he describes “President Putin’s emissary on this front,” whose plans match those of Mr. Torshin.

Mr. Torshin, he wrote, was planning to attend a reception being planned by Mr. Clay honoring wounded veterans that he expected Mr. Trump would also attend. Mr. Torshin expected to use the reception to “make ‘first contact’” with the candidate and present Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, with a gift from the Russian Orthodox Church.

According to Mr. Clay, neither Mr. Trump nor his campaign officials attended the veterans’ dinner. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Mr. Torshin did attend a separate N.R.A. dinner that night.

Mr. Torshin served in the upper house of the Russian Parliament and was a member of the country’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a government body that includes the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs and the director of the Federal Security Service, known as F.S.B., the K.G.B.’s successor. He has been a leading advocate of gun rights in Russia and of more closely linking the government and the Russian Orthodox Church.

An ode to bad taste and dubious intentions, the ha-ha comedy “The Disaster Artist” involves one of the favorite topics of the movies: itself. It’s another story of crushed Hollywood dreams, one that unfolds through the eyes of Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), an aspiring actor who hitched himself to a phenomenon when he met Tommy Wiseau (James Franco, Dave’s brother). A would-be auteur, the real Mr. Wiseau became a minor cult figure after he released a 2003 specialty item, “The Room,” that some anointed the worst movie ever made. In time, its notoriety started to pay off; in 2013, Mr. Sestero wrote a tell-all book.

Based on that tell-all (which Mr. Sestero wrote with Tom Bissell), “The Disaster Artist” recounts both the making of a friendship and the absurdly inept movie it produced. Greg meets Tommy in acting class, where they’re both bombing out. Greg comes off as simply incompetent as he flatly fumbles through a scene from “Waiting for Godot,” one of the movie’s first jokey meta-moments. (“Let us do something, while we have the chance!,” Vladimir exclaims in “Godot,” much as Tommy soon urges Greg.) Tommy, by vivid contrast, captivates the agape class — particularly the inhibited Greg — by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed.

An odd, inexplicable friendship begins, and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy’s apartment, the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business, though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades, as it does, amid the sunshine and smiles, and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender, Amber (Alison Brie). At last, inspired by Greg, Tommy — who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty — decides to direct and star in his own movie, with Greg as backup. It’s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination.

James Franco, who also directed “The Disaster Artist,” swoops through the movie like a star, one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics, Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too, having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau’s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing, Mr. Franco’s performance retains an interior lightness, a playfulness, including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn’t making fun of his character, at least not entirely; rather, he’s put distance into the mix, as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man, a construction.

The making of “The Room” gives “The Disaster Artist” its point and much of its broad comedy. Filmmakers love making movies about movies, and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar “Interior. Leather Bar.,” an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of “Cruising.”) Mr. Franco recreates the production of “The Room” — and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness — with an assured, energetic touch, some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen, who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy’s put-upon script supervisor.","Review: In ‘The Disaster Artist,’ How to Fail at Moviemaking",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/movies/the-disaster-artist-review-ames-franco-tommy-wiseau.html

For his part, Mr. Trump spent his campaign promising not to cut Medicare and Social Security. And Republicans will probably find, as they did when they failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that the public rises up to defend the programs they are trying to cut. Whatever political boost the Republicans could get for passing a tax cut could evaporate fast.

“Republicans are going to find that Democrats treat this tax bill the way Republicans treated Obamacare — it’s not trusted by people on the other side of the aisle,” said former Senator Judd Gregg, who was chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Simpson-Bowles commission, a bipartisan group of lawmakers and budget experts that produced a deficit reduction plan in 2010. “It will become a target, a rallying cry, which is unfortunate, because good tax reform, when done right, is not only good for the economy, it’s good for the parties.”

Many of the Republicans’ natural allies have criticized the bill for adding to the deficit and not dealing with the costs that were already driving up the government’s red ink. In an op-ed in The Washington Post, the leaders of that 2010 commission, former Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a Republican, and Erskine Bowles, a Democrat who is a former White House chief of staff, accused the Republicans of “deficit denial,” saying the bill incorporated only “goodies” and virtually no “hard choices.”

“Republicans have been telling themselves for years that they wanted to get into power so they could balance the budget, reduce the debt, cut spending and fix entitlements,” Ms. MacGuineas said. “They’ve just made it harder, not easier.”

For weeks, Democrats and their allies have been accusing Republicans of a “two-step” deceit, warning that they would cut taxes now and then use the increase in the deficit they caused to demand entitlement cuts later.

“When you run up the deficit, your next argument will be, ‘Gee, you’ve got a large deficit,’” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said in an interview.

Now Republicans are beginning to acknowledge as much. Mr. Ryan said at a town hall-style meeting last month that Congress had to spur growth and cut entitlements to reduce the national debt.

The Republican tax plan, he said “grows the economy.” But, he added, “we’ve got a lot of work to do in cutting spending.”

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was more specific on Wednesday, telling business leaders that the tax cuts were just the first step; the next is to reshape Social Security and Medicare for future retirees.

“Many argue that you can’t cut taxes because it will drive up the deficit,” he said. “But we have to do two things. We have to generate economic growth, which generates revenue, while reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.”

The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will cost the federal government $28.6 trillion through 2027. The tax cut, estimated at nearly $1.5 trillion, makes the problem only mildly worse.

But if that trillion-dollar boost to the government’s yawning fiscal hole is comparatively small mathematically, it could add up to much more politically if it keeps Democrats away from the negotiating table.

And even if Republicans do not pursue changes to entitlements, the tax bill will trigger pay-as-you-go requirements that Congress cut spending. That would be a particularly big hit to Medicare, which would face a $25 billion cut for the current fiscal year. Groups like AARP, the lobby for older Americans, warn that it would force doctors and hospitals to turn away patients because reimbursements would be cut so drastically.

Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, released a statement Friday saying that the so-called pay-go cuts “will not happen” because Congress would waive the law, as it has in the past. But they will need Democratic votes to do that, in a climate that is unusually partisan.

Regardless of whether Republicans can waive these cuts, David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP, said, “You know they’re going to come back and say, ‘We need to make more cuts to deal with the growing debts and deficit.’”

Some deficit hawks complain that Republicans have cast away any mantle of fiscal responsibility.

Robert L. Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that encourages fiscal responsibility, complained of hypocrisy from Republicans who have been clamoring to lift the spending caps that were created by the 2011 Budget Control Act.

If the tax cuts do not generate the revenue Republicans are expecting, he predicted, “people will say, ‘No, we’re not getting the growth because we should have cut taxes even more.’”

The United States is already facing a gloomy fiscal landscape. The federal deficit this year topped $660 billion, despite healthy economic growth, and the national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, appointed by President Barack Obama, warned last week that the national debt “is the type of thing that should keep people awake at night.”

But Democrats and their allies — and even some usual Republican allies — complain that Republicans are dishonest not to debate changes in spending and tax cuts at the same time, as the Simpson-Bowles commission did.

Sharon Parrott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Republicans understood how bad it would look to cut food benefits for poor families and health care for the elderly at the same time they were cutting taxes for corporations and the highest earners.

“There’s a reason they separate them,” she said. “They think they can get away with it.”

But in an election year with high political engagement, she said, “I think it’s wrong to count out the idea that the public will figure it out.”","Heading Toward Tax Victory, Republicans Eye Next Step: Cut Spending",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/tax-cuts-republicans-entitlements-medicare-social-security.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

1) 3 P.M. Art Stroll

For a city its size, Shanghai had been famously short on two things — green space and art. To remedy that, the city splashed out to build its own Museum Mile, along with a riverside park, in a new district known as West Bund. The Yuz Museum (entrance, 150 renminbi, or about $22), housed in a Sou Fujimoto-designed former aircraft hangar, has been at the forefront of the cultural awakening here, hosting high-profile shows featuring Andy Warhol, Alberto Giacometti and the Brooklyn-based artist KAWS in recent years. A short walk down the river is a fast-growing arts complex filled with studios and galleries, including the venerable ShanghART (free), which exhibits works by emerging Chinese artists and sells pieces by more established names like Zhou Tiehai and Ding Yi. Added to the mix this fall was another highly anticipated gallery, the Tokyo-based Ota Fine Arts.

2) 6 P.M. Happy Hour on High

It’s hard to fathom that the futuristic skyline of the Pudong financial district was little more than farmland 30 years ago. Ponder that while sipping a cocktail and taking in the fantastic light show at sunset, when the gleaming towers are illuminated with flashing “I Heart Shanghai” messages, and boats, twinkling with lights, glide by on the river. Perches abound for this neon-bathed sundowner, but the 30th floor balcony at the Hotel Indigo’s Char Bar offers one of the best vantage points — not to mention a highly drinkable Aperol spritz (130 renminbi).

3) 7:30 P.M. Beef Auction

Shanghai is loaded with celebrity chefs, but none can match the staying power of the Frenchman Paul Pairet, founder of the late-night stalwart Mr & Mrs Bund and the boundary-pushing, $600-a-head Ultraviolet. His latest offering, The Chop Chop Club, continues his penchant for quirky dining experiences with a grill-focused menu that pits diners against one another for the freshest cuts. A giant electronic board in the dining room announces the time dishes will be ready, along with available servings: “Bertha-oven charred oxtail teriyaki, 19:45, 4 portions, 250 renminbi!” First come are first served. The meats and fish are all expertly prepared and if you miss out on your first choice, the “B’ocktails” (pre-made cocktails in handsome glass bottles) are available all night.

4) 9 P.M. Cabaret Rebirth

Shanghai’s newfound wealth has led to a revival of the decadence and debauchery of its pre-World War II years — minus the opium dens. The most ribald party in town can be found in the distant, gritty Hongkou district at The Pearl, a former Buddhist temple transformed into a cabaret club with plush red banquettes and two tiers of balconies surrounding an intimate stage. The program runs the gamut from gender-bending drag and burlesque shows (trapeze artists and fire jugglers make frequent, heart-pounding appearances) to less risqué fare like “jazz diva” tribute concerts, featuring largely local performers.

It is the tender rack of lamb, however, that makes the most perfect roast for an elegant dinner, and it is the easiest to prepare. It may be the priciest cut, but a home-cooked rack of lamb is still far cheaper than one from a restaurant.

Three months ago, The Washington Post reported that even as Donald Trump ran for president, he pursued plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The next day, The New York Times published excerpts from emails between Felix Sater, a felon with ties to Russian organized crime, and Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump’s lawyers and Sater’s childhood friend, about the project. Sater was apparently an intermediary between Trump and Russia, and in a Nov. 3, 2015, email to Cohen, he made the strange argument that a successful deal would lead to Trump’s becoming president. Boasting that he was close enough to Vladimir Putin to let Ivanka Trump sit in the Russian president’s desk chair, Sater wrote, “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.”

These stories were, at the time, bombshells. At a minimum, they showed that Trump was lying when he said, repeatedly, that he had “nothing to do with Russia.” Further, Sater’s logic — that Putin’s buy-in on a real estate deal would result in Trump’s election — was bizarre, suggesting that some part of the proposed collaboration was left unsaid.

But three months feels like three decades in Trump years, and I mostly forgot about these reports until I read Luke Harding’s new book, “Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.” One uncanny aspect of the investigations into Trump’s Russia connections is that instead of too little evidence there’s too much. It’s impossible to keep it straight without the kind of chaotic wall charts that Carrie Mathison of “Homeland” assembled during her manic episodes. Incidents that would be major scandals in a normal administration — like the mere fact of Trump’s connection to Sater — become minor subplots in this one.

That’s why “Collusion” is so essential, and why I wish everyone who is skeptical that Russia has leverage over Trump would read it. This country — at least the parts not wholly under the sway of right-wing propaganda — needs to come to terms with substantial evidence that the president is in thrall to a foreign power.

Harding, the former Moscow bureau chief of The Guardian, has been reporting on shady characters like Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was indicted last month, long before Trump announced his candidacy. He was able to interview Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier attempting to detail Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin, and who describes the conspiracy between the American president and the Russians as “massive — absolutely massive.”

“Collusion” doesn’t purport to solve all the mysteries of this alleged conspiracy. There’s no longer any serious question that there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but the extent of the cooperation, and the precise nature of it, remains opaque. Harding makes a strong case for Steele’s credibility, but Steele reportedly said that the raw intelligence in his dossier is only 70 percent to 90 percent accurate, so it’s hard to know which parts of it to believe.","Odds Are, Russia Owns Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/opinion/trump-patriot-russia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

House Republicans showed their colors when they first blocked passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Plan, despite the urgent pleas of their own president, George W. Bush, and the speaker of the House, John Boehner. The seeds of a (largely phony) populist reaction were planted.

Second, there was the “Obama effect.” When Mr. Bush became president, Democrats worked with him to enact sweeping education reform early on and provided the key votes to pass his top priority, tax cuts. With President Barack Obama, it was different. While many argued that the problem was that Mr. Obama failed to schmooze enough with Republicans in Congress, we saw a deliberate Republican strategy to oppose all of his initiatives and frame his attempts to compromise as weak or inauthentic. The Senate under the majority leader Mitch McConnell weaponized the filibuster to obstruct legislation, block judges and upend the policy process. The Obama effect had an ominous twist, an undercurrent of racism that was itself embodied in the “birther” movement led by Donald Trump.

House leaders continued to inflame the populist anger of their base to win enormous midterm victories in 2010 and 2014. They repeatedly promised the impossible under divided party government: that if they won, Mr. Obama would be forced to his knees, his policies obliterated and government as we knew it demolished. Their subsequent failures to do so spurred even more rage, this time directed at establishment Republican leaders. But most pundits still clung to the belief that pragmatism would win out and Republicans would nominate an establishment insider in 2016.

Third, we have seen the impact of significant changes in the news media, which had a far greater importance on the right than on the left. The development of the modern conservative media echo chamber began with the rise of Rush Limbaugh and talk radio in the late 1980s and ramped up with the birth of Fox News. Matt Drudge, his protégé Andrew Breitbart and Breitbart’s successor Steve Bannon leveraged the power of the internet to espouse their far-right views. And with the advent of social media, we saw the emergence of a radical “alt-right” media ecosystem able to create its own “facts” and build an audience around hostility to the establishment, anti-immigration sentiment and racial resentment. Nothing even close to comparable exists on the left.

Mr. Trump’s election and behavior during his first 10 months in office represent not a break with the past but an extreme acceleration of a process that was long underway in conservative politics. The Republican Party is now rationalizing and enabling Mr. Trump’s autocratic, kleptocratic, dangerous and downright embarrassing behavior in hopes of salvaging key elements of its ideological agenda: cutting taxes for the wealthy (as part of possibly the worst tax bill in American history), hobbling the regulatory regime, gutting core government functions and repealing Obamacare without any reasonable plan to replace it.

This is a far cry from the aspirations of Republican presidential giants like Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, as well as legions of former Republican senators and representatives who identified critical roles for government and worked tirelessly to make them succeed. It’s an agenda bereft of any serious efforts to remedy the problems that trouble vast segments of the American public, including the disaffected voters who flocked to Mr. Trump.

The failure of Republican members of Congress to resist the anti-democratic behavior of President Trump — including holding not a single hearing on his and his team’s kleptocracy — is cringe-worthy. A few Republican senators have spoken up, but occasional words have not been matched by any meaningful deeds. Only conservative intellectuals have acknowledged the bankruptcy of the Republican Party.

We have never suggested that Democrats are angels and Republicans devils. Parties exist to win elections and organize government, and they are shaped by the interests, ideas and donors that constitute their coalitions. Neither party is immune from a pull to the extreme.

She would like to open Canyon Ranches in Florida and California to attract tourists from South America and Asia. Ms. Docherty also wants to extend the brand to the “continuing care retirement community” market, which includes assisted living: a growth business, to be sure.

Mr. Zuckerman had been an accountant in New Jersey and moved his pregnant wife and young child in 1958 to the desert town of Tucson, where he became a real estate developer. As he approached his 40th birthday in 1968, a doctor told him that his yo-yo dieting was going to kill him. He needed to lose 30 to 40 pounds for good.

He went to Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico, but was the only male guest there and left after a self-conscious two days.

Ten years later, after his father died, Mr. Zuckerman again decided to confront his health. He went to the Oaks at Ojai, in California, and at last began to lose the weight. He returned home thinking about how to focus fully on his new commitment to health and fitness.

Two weeks after returning, he and his wife bought a 42-acre dude ranch in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona for $714,000. He hired Karma Kientzler, the woman at the Oaks at Ojai who had helped him to find a fitness program (then a somewhat novel concept) feasible for a middle-aged man with a history of asthma.

“To be in Tucson and not to hike is to be in Paris and not see the Eiffel Tower,” Ms. Hochman told him.

In the 1980s, Mr. Zuckerman decided he wanted to offer yoga but couldn’t find any instructors in town. “The only place I finally found yoga teachers was west of Tucson, there was a seminary or sanctuary or something,” he said. “These men and women came to the Ranch in white robes and taught yoga. I got letters and phone calls from guests saying, ‘Are you turning this place into a cult?’”

Destination health spas had been a part of American culture (the Golden Door, Cal-a-Vie), but Canyon Ranch’s focus on a mind-body-spirit approach to weight loss, with exercise and small portions punctuated by indulgences like massage and body treatments, was seized on by high-profile figures, including Richard Simmons and Oprah.

As Jane Fonda brought aerobics to the VCR and Olivia Newton-John brought headbanded leotard fashion to the street, Canyon Ranch brought diet and exercise to the vacation.

In Vail, Colo., a few years after Canyon Ranch opened, Ms. Kientzler met a man named Ron Fletcher, a former Martha Graham dancer who was teaching a strengthening movement program that he had studied for years in New York at the physical therapy studio owned by Joseph and Clara Pilates.

Ms. Kientzler returned twice a year to Vail to study Pilates with Mr. Fletcher and began to offer it in the early 1990s at Canyon Ranch as part of its “Emotion in Motion” classes. She hired John White, another Martha Graham dancer, who had come to Tucson after visiting a friend there. “I thought I was moving to the middle of nowhere, and then I’m teaching Pilates to people like Elaine May, George C. Scott, Anne Bancroft and Kurt Cobain,” Mr. White said.

Celebrities, upper-middle-class suburbanites and rich vacationers from around the country (and beyond) flocked to Canyon Ranch to jump-start health and weight loss. In 1989, the company opened the outpost in Lenox.

Leaning Las Vegas

Over the next two decades, the company expanded and contracted like some of its clients’ waistlines.

Canyon Ranch developed luxury properties, like 100 homes on land adjacent to the retreat in Tucson. The company joined forces with Celebrity Cruises and now operates spas on 20 cruise ships. And it built a 134,000-square-foot day spa that connects the Venetian and Palazzo Resorts on the Strip in Las Vegas.

There have been failures, too. Canyon Ranch operated a hotel in Miami Beach that was financed in part by Lehman Brothers and opened in September 2008, a few months before Lehman went bankrupt. (The hotel was sold and is now the Carillon.) The company opened a location in Kaplankaya, Turkey, in 2016, and pulled out of the management agreement less than a year later, after an attempted coup and terrorism hurt European tourism to the Turkish Riviera.

One of Ms. Docherty’s big ventures is the development of 19 luxury apartments attached to the Lenox resort, resplendent with white marble and costing in the millions. Eleven units remain on the market.

“I think people are waiting to see if Canyon Ranch is going to change,” said Mr. Zuckerman, who was supportive of the project.

By 2014, when he was well into his 80s, he sold a majority interest in Canyon Ranch to Mr. Goff’s Crescent Real Estate Holdings. Mr. Goff hired Ms. Docherty as Canyon Ranch’s first corporate C.E.O. in 2015. Earlier this year, Mr. Zuckerman sold his remaining interest to Crescent and retired, though he and his wife still live in a house on the Canyon Ranch grounds in Tucson, and he still works out almost daily.

Many of the concepts Mr. Zuckerman championed have become part of Americans’ everyday lives. Boutique fitness studios and day spas are now in strip malls around the country. Being able to spend extended time in a public setting wearing workout leggings is no longer a special thrill. Whole Foods and other distributors have made organic food and juice bars mainstream.

A brand that was ahead on all of this now has to fight for relevance. “Canyon Ranch caters to an elite demographic that is older, white and wealthy, and it hasn’t adapted to the notion that wellness is no longer something you do for a weekend or a week when you need an intervention,” said Jason Wachob, the founder and C.E.O. of MindBodyGreen, a wellness-focused media company aimed at millennials. “That is so out of touch.”

But the loyalty of aging baby boomers is a considerable asset. Ms. Docherty is trying to bring energy and attract new customers to an enterprise that gets more than half of its business (58 percent in Tucson, 55 percent in Lenox) from repeat guests.

Nili Cohen, 73, from Fort Lee, N.J., is one of them, first vacationing at the resort in Lenox about 25 years ago. This October she visited for the 110th time.

Ms. Cohen likes to start her days at Canyon Ranch on the group walk at 7 a.m., then eats a small breakfast, does a 9 a.m. stretch class and then plays tennis for a few hours. She often caps off the day with a 4 p.m. “muscle melt massage,” followed by a meditation session and perhaps a facial. She sees on-staff doctors there to monitor her cholesterol.

Thus far, she has loved the changes implemented by Ms. Docherty and her team. The food is better, Ms. Cohen said, and the gym equipment is more modern.

But she doesn’t like Botox, even as she understands why Canyon Ranch is starting to offer it. “They have to be with the times,” Ms. Cohen said.",The Last Resort? Canyon Ranch Succumbs to Botox,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/style/canyon-ranch-resort.html

That kind of event can change one’s perspective, and for the photographer Cig Harvey, her brush with vehicular death in 2015 inspired her new series “You an Orchestra You a Bomb,” recently released by Schilt Publishing, which also opens as a solo exhibition at Robert Mann in New York on December 7.

One easily imagines Narnia just through the wardrobe door or Hogwarts awaiting at the end of the train ride. (Surprisingly, Ms. Harvey, who was born in England, has never read the Harry Potter books.)

As is her custom, the series features Ms. Harvey’s six-year-old daughter, Scout, along with other relatives and friends. And the narrative is clearly propelled by the motivations of a mother, one enraptured by life after a near-death experience.

“The spark was ignited after I was in a serious car accident,” she said. “Then I started to make work about my relationship to life itself, and how fragile that felt in that moment.”

Photo

While her previous projects, including the books “Gardening at Night” and “You Look At Me Like An Emergency,” featured images that were preconceived and carefully constructed, Ms. Harvey began shooting in a more documentary style after her accident, roaming around with a camera in hand. While she still poses her subjects, her creativity pushed her to explore the world further, and to allow life to present serendipitous moments, like an old man jumping from a dock into the sea, or a pregnant friend standing stock-still on a misty beach.

“Every day, I sought out in everyday places images that made me jolt; that created some type of awe, and made me gasp because it was so beautiful,” she said. “And most of them are just in my backyard.”

Her book and exhibit carefully recreate that sense of childhood wonder, mixing saturated colors with verdant symbols and engaging text, allowing viewers to contemplate that sense of the unknown, but from a place of joy rather than anxiety. Ms. Harvey’s stories — poetic interludes sprinkled through the photographic narrative — add to the feeling that one has climbed into the back of her head, like in the film “Being John Malkovich,” and reality is twisted as a result.

Photo

Whether it’s a child’s tooth tied to red string, a platter of four-leaf clovers, a box full of butterflies, or a table covered with tangerines, that feeling of rapture, of youthful exuberance, permeates the pages. One vignette sums up her obsession with magic — with the things we feel but cannot understand:

“At a science-themed birthday I sit with the 5-year-olds in the front row, gasping at the impossibility of it all. / I keep mixing up science and magic. / Please do let me stop you, as you begin to explain the physics.”

Other artists, notably Sally Mann, have featured their children as a way of exploring universal themes, but the young women in this book seem like stand-ins for storybook characters. Whether they’re holding dead bugs or peeking out from behind a red curtain, the feeling is hard to escape, particularly with an image near the book’s end that features Scout dressed in a cape like Little Red Riding Hood.

Because tragedy is always with us, fairy tales have traditionally dealt with themes of life and death in exaggerated ways, so to explain difficult ideas to children. As a mother, Ms. Harvey is clearly grappling with these issues that suffuse her photographs.

Photo

“I became a better photographer when I became mother, and by better, I mean the work got more complicated and less decorative, because my world became more complicated,” she said. “The world became more beautiful, and it also became more terrifying. This book is about those two extremes.”

In the end, that’s what Ms. Harvey hopes people will get from “You an Orchestra You a Bomb” — a sense of being transported and, in turn, transformed by a perspective that helps them appreciate the ephemeral quality of life.

“Everything feels very temporary,” she said. “We have these short lives. How can we pack as much into them, and love fiercely, protect fiercely, give fiercely, deal with difficult things, and come through other side?”

‘Bombs in Your Backyard’

From ProPublica: The toxic contamination of the upstate New York town of Hoosick Falls alerted many in Albany — the state’s sometimes slow-to-react capital — to the perils of ignoring the dangers of commercial-use poisons. But even that crisis, still unfolding, seems to pale in comparison to the vast number of toxic waste sites outlined in this excellent examination of the military’s handling of its munitions and other hazardous waste. The extent of the problem is made clear by this interactive map of such sites — some “converted to parks and wildlife reserves and even housing developments.” (Gulp.) ProPublica invites journalists to use the data to research and write more about the “bombs in our backyard.” I second, and accept. — Jesse McKinley, Albany bureau chief

With barely a vote to spare early Saturday morning, the Senate passed a tax bill confirming that the Republican leaders’ primary goal is to enrich the country’s elite at the expense of everybody else, including future generations who will end up bearing the cost. The approval of this looting of the public purse by corporations and the wealthy makes it a near certainty that President Trump will sign this or a similar bill into law in the coming days.

The bill is expected to add more than $1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, a debt that will be paid by the poor and middle class in future tax increases and spending cuts to Medicare, Social Security and other government programs. Its modest tax cuts for the middle class disappear after eight years. And up to 13 million people stand to lose their health insurance because the bill makes a big change to the Affordable Care Act.

Yet Republicans somehow found a way to give a giant and permanent tax cut to corporations like Apple, General Electric and Goldman Sachs, saving those businesses tens of billions of dollars.

The votes for the bill by Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona were particularly disheartening. Ms. Collins, who helped sink an effort to effectively repeal the A.C.A. in September, blithely voted for a tax bill that will leave a gaping hole in that law by repealing its requirement that most people have insurance or pay a penalty. She traded away her vote for an inadequate deduction for property taxes and empty promises from Mr. Trump and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that they would help shore up the A.C.A., which they have repeatedly tried to sabotage. Mr. McCain, who previously voted against tax cuts in the Bush era because they were heavily tilted in favor of the rich rather than the middle class, seemed unconcerned that this bill was even worse in that regard.

As the photographer for Michael Musto’s weekly nightlife column in the Village Voice, Ms. McGann captured a transition in New York club life as the 1980s gave way to the 1990s, and a new generation of nocturnal creatures showed its plumage.
“After Warhol died, everything changed,” Ms. McGann said.
“That was the end,” Ms. McGann said.","Everyone knows that New York’s nightlife was so much cooler back in the day. They just don’t agree on when that day was. Maybe the glory nights of Danceteria and the Latin Quarter in the 1980s, or the shimmering ‘70s heyday of Studio 54. Maybe back to the punk explosion at CBGB, or further to Andy Warhol’s court at Max’s Kansas City – all the way back past the Savoy Ballroom of the Harlem Renaissance to Pfaff’s beer cellar on Broadway near Bleecker Street, first outpost of American bohemia, where Walt Whitman probably sidled up to some rugged Bowery b’hoy and said, “Things were much livelier last week, too bad you missed it.”

Catherine McGann, who photographed New York nightlife from 1986 to 2001, never shook the feeling that the good times had ended just before she arrived. “Like Club 57,” she said, referring to the small but influential club that is the subject of “Club 57: Film, Performance, and Art in the East Village, 1978–1983,” a new exhibition chronicling the art scene there between 1978 and 1983, at the Museum of Modern Art.

“I photographed a lot of those people from that world, like Warhol or Keith Haring,” Ms. McGann said. “But it wasn’t before ’83, so I guess it doesn’t count.”

“After Warhol died, everything changed,” Ms. McGann said. “Who was running the party? That’s when the club kids stepped in and began to dominate. The 80’s was more underground and grungy. The 90s was the equivalent of ‘The Great Gatsby.’ It was money and decadence and endless nightclubs, velvet ropes and drink tickets, a lot of self-promotion, look at me, look at me, take my picture.”

That era crashed with the 1996 murder and dismemberment of a club kid named Andre Melendez by Michael Alig and Robert Riggs, two other regulars. “That was the end,” Ms. McGann said. “That summed it all up.”

Ms. McGann no longer lives in New York, forced out by real estate prices. That, too, speaks volumes about how the city’s nightlife has changed.

It’s not just the eye-popping settlements in some cases, like the $32 million paid by Bill O’Reilly to settle a harassment claim. Nor is it just the high salaries network stars have been making while allegedly assaulting subordinates, like the $20 million, or more, for Matt Lauer. It only starts there.

The bigger cost derives from how women’s ideas are discounted and their talent ignored. I have seen it up close in the two worlds I know best: Wall Street, where I was chief executive of Smith Barney and of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and in Silicon Valley, where I’ve raised money to run my start-up, Ellevest. These places are perhaps the purest microcosms of capitalism, and their lessons are instructive for all of us.

Both Wall Street and venture capital are industries whose product is money: Wall Street directs trillions of dollars to the sectors or businesses that it believes will deliver the highest returns. Likewise, Silicon Valley invests hundreds of billions of dollars in start-ups that it believes will deliver the best returns. Both pick economic winners and losers.

Wall Street has for years prided itself on being a “meritocracy,” arguing that its performance-based culture drives capital to the best trading ideas and the best deals. Despite research showing that companies with more diversity, and particularly more women in leadership, offer higher returns on capital, lower risk and greater innovation than firms without such leadership, Wall Street has been, and is, predominantly male at the top. Its trading floors are 90 percent men. This ignores studies indicating that members of homogeneous groups tend to trust one another too much, leading to potential market mispricings.

Homogeneity has led Wall Street firms to travel in packs, going after the same opportunities at the same time: junk bonds in the 1980s, tech stocks in the late 1990s and subprime lending in the run-up to the crash 10 years ago. In particular, when the subprime bet proved wrong, the big banks went essentially bankrupt and were bailed out by the United States government because officials worried that the economic cost of their failure would have been catastrophic.

Thus one can draw a line from the gender discrimination on Wall Street through to the lack of women — and lack of diversity of thought — in the industry to increased risk and to the financial crisis.

Silicon Valley today is rife with parallels to Wall Street, its lessons unlearned. Like Wall Street, it prides itself on its meritocratic culture, arguing that its performance-based orientation will drive capital to the best start-ups. There are few senior women at the top venture capital firms. The industry funds few start-ups run by women. Last year, of the approximately $60 billion that venture capital firms invested, just $1.5 billion went to businesses with female founders.

One might argue that start-ups run by men just happen to deliver the highest possible returns. The mythology around the industry bolsters this, with venture capitalists boasting of investing in Facebook practically out of the dorm room.

But that argument doesn’t hold up. Investors in venture capital funds would have been as well off simply investing in the stock market over the past five to 15 years. That’s what I see in reviewing the data from the research firm Cambridge Associates: Investors in the high-risk, high-reward world of start-ups essentially did no better than they could have opening an account at their neighborhood brokerage. What might help those venture capitalists? First Round Capital reports that its investments in companies with a female founder have posted 63 percent better returns than men-only firms.

Venture capital and Wall Street are both funded by “other people’s money.” Pension funds, endowments, mutual funds and individual investors provide the fuel that enables this sexist, exclusionary behavior. The irony is that so many of these endowments and foundations exist to make the world a fairer place, not to exclude vast segments of the population. Yet because their money is tied up in industries where women’s perspectives, and diversity of viewpoints, aren’t valued on the whole, their causes — and their bottom lines — lose out.

This moment of ferreting out sexual harassers is a step forward. It also reveals how much work we have to do on the biases that allowed such behavior to flourish.

This summer, I was in Silicon Valley, pitching for a round of funding for my company. I was the only woman in a room of 18 venture capitalists. A few of the men were engaged, a few were typing on their iPhones, and the lead investor was alternating between peppering me with questions and leaning back in his chair with his arms folded. He challenged my knowledge on digital acquisition, on acquisition costs.

Fair enough, even if he was being a little prickly. Finally, I noted that our business was planning to hire a few financial advisers. He proceeded to give me chapter and verse on how financial advisers are hard to manage and instructed me on the economics of the financial advisory business.

I was astonished, because I have managed more financial advisers in my career than probably anyone in the country. And though it’s been years since I have been sexually harassed the way I was at Salomon, I realized in that moment how deep our gender views run, how men are still seen as leaders and women as more junior.

This man naturally assumed that he knew more about it than I did. It was his ingrained view of women — a view that’s costing all of us.",The Cost of Devaluing Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/the-cost-of-devaluing-women.html

“I became a better photographer when I became mother, and by better, I mean the work got more complicated and less decorative, because my world became more complicated,” she said. “The world became more beautiful, and it also became more terrifying. This book is about those two extremes.”

In the end, that’s what Ms. Harvey hopes people will get from “You an Orchestra You a Bomb” — a sense of being transported and, in turn, transformed by a perspective that helps them appreciate the ephemeral quality of life.

“Everything feels very temporary,” she said. “We have these short lives. How can we pack as much into them, and love fiercely, protect fiercely, give fiercely, deal with difficult things, and come through other side?”

The National Flood Insurance Program and the flood maps used to establish the need for insurance have been a constant source of controversy. Critics of the program argue that it often ends up repeatedly paying for damaged properties instead of pressing for mitigation of flood risks and relocation, and thus ends up encouraging people to build — and rebuild — in risky places.

The risk is defined by law, not nature: FEMA and the flood insurance program look to what is known as 100-year flood elevation to determine who needs to buy insurance. Anything lower than that is considered to be in the flood plain. Above that level, supposedly, is safety.

But how safe? The 100-year flood level does not mean a flood will happen only once every 100 years. Instead, it refers to a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year. (A 500-year flood, which reaches somewhat higher elevation, is one with a .2 percent chance of occurring in a year.) That 1 percent chance actually translates into a one-in-four chance of a flood occurring at least once during the life of a 30-year mortgage. And in Houston, as in many parts of the country, 100-year floods are distressingly common. The Houston area saw three such events in the past three years. Climate change threatens to make them even more likely.

To Mr. Blackburn, the 100-year line is too arbitrary for comfort. What’s more, the flood maps have long been considered highly inaccurate.

This led to a lot of unhappiness among homeowners forced to pay perhaps $5,000 annually for insurance that would cost less than a tenth of that outside the official flood plain.

“People started to come in and argue and said, ‘You showed me in a flood plain and I’m 40 feet above that level.’ Because FEMA’s topography was so inaccurate,” said Larry A. Larson, director emeritus of the Association of State Floodplain Managers in Madison, Wis.

By the 1980s, he said, the agency, too overwhelmed and underfinanced to make all the corrections itself, instituted new procedures for accepting revised elevation data from engineers hired by aggrieved citizens.

Developers have taken advantage of the new system as well, FEMA documents show, with a range of techniques from hiring surveyors to correct elevations to building structures like levees and drainage channels. In one of the most common methods, developers truck in tons of soil — known as “fill” in the building trade — and dump it over wide areas to raise the elevation above the flood plain. Mr. Larson called changes that lifted the ground only slightly above the flood plain “a bad idea” because such areas generally remain prone to flooding.

“Once a flood plain, always a flood plain,” he said. “It’s still got risk.”

His observation was borne out in striking fashion in the neighborhoods covered by the two map revisions examined by The Times: Eighty of the 81 homes within those areas near Spring Creek — which flows through The Woodlands — sustained some degree of flooding, according to FEMA statistics.

Harris County, home to large parts of suburban Houston, including the newer sections of The Woodlands, is one of a handful of districts around the nation that FEMA has granted a sort of shared authority in approving map revisions. Although the conditions of this authority are complex, and vary from district to district, others have used it to enforce standards that are more stringent — for example, generally requiring higher elevations for any change and pushing developments further from creeks than FEMA does.

For its part, Harris County has stuck with FEMA’s elevation standards. “We don’t want to touch the FEMA process; we want to keep it intact,” said Ataul Hannan, planning division director for the Harris County Flood Control District.

What the county has done is put a great deal of effort, and expense, into creating special software model for more accurately calculating flooding risks and the wider effects of development in the relatively flat terrain of the Houston area, Mr. Hannan said. Comparing Harris County’s regulations to those in other parts of the country is unfair, he added, because the topographies are so different.

In the business of flood-map revision, the pressure usually runs one way. There is seldom much local interest in having a neighborhood declared flood prone, said Sarah Pralle, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University who studies the politics of flood insurance and has written about lobbying efforts by New York and New Orleans to alter the maps.

“The shrinkage of the flood maps,” she said, “is always treated in a very positive way.”

Shifting Terrain

As early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing “wooded areas and a few rural home sites,” according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market.

Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years.

That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve.

“This would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,” Mr. Gilmer said.

FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek — including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there “when it wasn’t flooded.”

By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show.

The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place — Ms. Martinez’s street — 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place — Mr. Hickey’s street — and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas.

The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Seañez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, “They said, ‘You don’t even have to purchase it,’” Ms. Seañez recalled.

Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey’s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. “We see that the flood plain was revised recently,” the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck.",Developers Said Their Homes Were Out of a Flood Zone.

VARIETY PUZZLE — Fred Piscop is one of the best in the business, so my eyes lit up when I heard that this weekend’s variety would be one of his signature Split Decision puzzles. Mr. Piscop sharpens our pattern recognition abilities with each construction, which I think is crucial to solving normal crossword puzzles, especially when the cluing is difficult.

The best bit of advice I have about today’s puzzle is to be wary before entering letters to shorter word splits, and to instead search for unusual letter blends that bear less possibilities. For instance, take the seven-letter answer with the split ?MI????/?FF????. We know that the first letter must be a vowel, for no consonants can precede two Fs, and that the fourth letter is most likely a vowel as well. With these constraints, we can eventually deduce that the split is AMIABLE/AFFABLE.

However, when the split is shorter, as with ?IX/?AY, it is important to keep all possibilities open where appropriate. Sure, S works well, but so do M, N, F and perhaps P. When ARSENAL/ARSENIC in the top-left corner becomes obvious, then the N will be filled in correctly, but until then, it’s best to refrain from guessing without some sort of logic behind it.

Today I learned that POTPIES can be written as a single word, and that CODFISH and COMMISH are only two letters apart. As an avid fantasy football league manager, I enjoyed seeing the latter — the colloquial term for “commissioner” — in a New York Times puzzle.

Still, in her remarks to the crowd of nearly 1,000, Ms. DeVos signaled her impatience.
“We are at a time for choosing,” Ms. DeVos said.
“The fact that she’s in the Trump administration has not helped the parent choice,” said Mr. Fuller, the Marquette professor.
“I think the president continues to lead in an important direction in our country,” Ms. DeVos said.","Funding requests for private school vouchers and charter schools that Ms. DeVos said would jump-start “the most ambitious expansion of education choice in our nation’s history” have largely been ignored by Congress. A tax-credit scholarship program, like the one Mr. Bush expanded in Florida, was supposed to go national — but has not taken flight.

The one proposal that has made some progress, an expansion of tax-favored 529 savings plans in the Republican tax overhaul to allow families to put away savings for private school tuition, has divided conservatives, some of whom say the expansion will not reach the low-income families that the school choice movement was created for. The beneficiaries would be families with money to sock away at the end of the month.

“The best and worst thing she’s done has electrified the conversation, and the fact that she had everybody coming for her from Day 1 shows what’s at stake,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the advocacy group 50CAN, or the 50-State Campaign for Achievement Now. “But not as much has gotten done as we would like, and certainly what we wanted to get accomplished legislatively and thought would happen right away is not happening.”

Among choice advocates, Ms. DeVos still appeared to have broad support, and some of her allies blamed deep, divisive partisanship for her shortcomings.

“I don’t think people are giving her a real chance inside or outside the department,” said Robert Enlow, the president of the advocacy group EdChoice. “Ideology and partisanship has really gotten in the way.”

But most echoed Jack McCarthy, who runs an AppleTree early learning center and charter school in Washington.

He said Ms. DeVos’s principles were not unlike others that he had heard from former secretaries of education, including her immediate predecessors, Arne Duncan and John B. King Jr., who supported charter schools. But their boss, Barack Obama, was not the polarizing figure Mr. Trump is in the education community.

“The difference is the president,” Mr. McCarthy said. “She’s facing the general backlash to whoever is in a leadership position in that administration. And that’s a shame.”

Ms. DeVos, who sat on the board of Mr. Bush’s foundation and contributed to his failed 2016 presidential campaign, used her first address to the group as secretary to assure her audience that she had not been deterred.

“Allow me to borrow a line from the great American author Mark Twain: The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,” she said, calling out “unions, union bosses, the defenders of the status quo, the education-expert bloggers and muckrakers, and many of our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle in Congress.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” she said. “In fact, I’m just getting started.”

Mr. Bush called her the “epitome of a principled reformer who puts kids first.”

In an interview, Mr. Bush — who during the campaign called Mr. Trump “a chaos candidate” who would become “a chaos president” — acknowledged that Ms. DeVos had limited power and was operating in a “hyperpartisan environment.” He said he expected that she would leave her mark in some legislative effort.

“That hasn’t happened yet, but not much has happened,” Mr. Bush said. “I don’t blame her for that. This has been a period of adjustment, and I think she’s done a great job in changing who’s important.”

Mr. Bush said that Ms. DeVos’s real battle was not in Washington and that she had focused her attention in the right places: in the states, building coalitions to garner support for school choice policies that will ultimately be up to states to put in place.

Still, in her remarks to the crowd of nearly 1,000, Ms. DeVos signaled her impatience.

“We are at a time for choosing,” Ms. DeVos said. “We can choose to turn away, to offer platitudes or promises of action next year. Or we can say: no more. No more empty rhetoric, no more folding to political pressure, no more accepting by inaction this fundamental injustice that stains the future of the greatest republic in the history of the world. No more.”

But education policy experts say they see little Ms. DeVos can accomplish. The administration’s deregulatory push and support of the Every Student Succeeds Act, a new federal law that pushes most decision-making to states, leave her department weakened.

“She wasn’t set up to have power. She was set up to reverse everything,” said Chris Stewart, the chief executive of Wayfinder Foundation and a longtime education activist who moderated a panel of parents at the convention. “She has a bully pulpit, but you can’t get much done talking.”

Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, said Ms. DeVos’s strong messaging could sometimes be off-putting, especially at a time when personal attacks are a common retort of the administration.

“I see a lot of coming out swinging at the teachers union, but it turns off people like me to not hear her talk about the limitations to choice,” Ms. Lake said. “If the plan is to just rally the base and asserting that choice is the answer, they’re not going to move things.”

Ms. DeVos’s obligation to carry out the administration’s deregulation agenda has been among the biggest challenges for the choice movement, many here said.

She has repealed guidance issued to states by the Obama administration on matters of civil rights that has been criticized by conservatives as federal overreach. She also delayed carrying out regulations designed to protect student borrowers, especially low-income students, that critics say are too broad and punitive.

“A lot of the regulatory changes that are happening in the office don’t seem to be coming from the person that I did state advocacy with like five or six years ago,” Mr. Bradford said. “The president’s administration’s a complicated one that has lots of people doing things they wouldn’t naturally do.”

And across the country, advocates are having a hard time reconciling Ms. DeVos’s philosophical and political affiliations.

“The fact that she’s in the Trump administration has not helped the parent choice,” said Mr. Fuller, the Marquette professor. “People who are on the ground, one of the things we now have to fight is guilt by association with Donald Trump.”

At a Murfreesboro, Tenn., high school the day before her keynote address, Ms. DeVos offered a rare admonition from a cabinet member on Mr. Trump’s language. According to The Tennessean, Ms. DeVos was asked whether the president was a good role model for children after he mocked Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” while honoring Navajo veterans. “I think the president continues to lead in an important direction in our country,” Ms. DeVos said. “And I think that we can all do well to reflect on the things we say before we say them.”",Betsy DeVos Allies See New Obstacle to School Choice Efforts: Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/betsy-devos-school-choice-vouchers-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Never ever ignore the signs.” Luckily for both author and reader, Kassabova seems indeed to have heeded every sign and missed nothing along the way.

LOVE OF COUNTRY: A Journey Through the Hebrides (University of Chicago, $27.50) addresses a homecoming of a different sort. Madeleine Bunting, a Londoner, confesses that “the north-west called to the restlessness in me,” and so she sets out to “zigzag … through the Hebrides out into the blue space on the map. Out to the edge.” Over the course of six years she returns again and again to some of the 270 islands off Scotland’s west coast, and comes to regard these wet, weather-whipped, sparsely populated outcrops as, to quote the Irish Gaelic poet Liam O Muirthile, a kind of “soul territory.”

Photo

Bunting follows in a long tradition of English writers escaping up to the region where the land fractures and frays. To her predecessors, she notes, “the Hebrides offered … an unusual degree of personal freedom from convention and class.” It was on Jura, with a population of fewer than 200, that George Orwell retreated to write “Nineteen Eighty-Four.” Bunting makes a pilgrimage to where he “set up his typewriter in front of the window overlooking the sea, and with that vista in front of him, he infused the novel with a pervasive horror of the dirty, urban tedium of its setting.” Later she reminds us that it was on the wind-battered island of Iona that Irish monks seeking a hermit’s life gave the world the magnificent gift of “The Book of Kells.”

History along this coast, Bunting notes early on, “is unruly, and does not fit into an orderly narrative.” Eventually, though, that history, “mute with trauma,” speaks forcibly to her: “I had encountered multiple types of loss on my journey: of land, language, country and nation.” Her travels culminate in a visit to the Hebrides’ most iconic ruin, St. Kilda. After centuries of habitation, the final 36 residents requested evacuation from this remotest of communities in 1930. For Bunting, the loss still reverberates.

Running under her entire narrative are the feelings Bunting has for her homeland, England, and for the larger entity of Britain. It’s this relationship that’s eventually called into question and cuts deepest. She has justifiable difficulty reconciling, among other injustices, the removal of people from their land at the hands of the Crown during the 18th and 19th centuries: “No other country in Europe witnessed such brutal clearances.” This larger reckoning is what ultimately gives “Love of Country” its power and resonance. After all, what is love — of people, institutions or country — but the attempt to reconcile what cannot be easily reconciled?

The “survival” tale has long occupied a storied corner of the travel writing genre, from “The Worst Journey in the World,” Apsley Cherry-Garrard’s classic recounting of Scott’s 1910 Antarctic expedition, to Nathaniel Philbrick’s history of the whaling disaster that inspired “Moby-Dick,” “In the Heart of the Sea.” Holly FitzGerald’s RUTHLESS RIVER: Love and Survival by Raft on the Amazon’s Relentless Madre de Dios (Vintage, paper, $16) instantly takes its spot among these giants.

The story picks up in the early 1970s in the midst of the long South American “dream honeymoon” of FitzGerald and her new husband, Fitz. That they survive a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle, then escape a penal colony, only sets the stage for their real troubles.

Making their way to freedom in the backwater of Puerto Maldonado, the couple learn that they’re stranded. It’s then that a mysterious, well-dressed stranger approaches their table at a local restaurant. “I can’t help but overhear your difficulty,” he begins. The man, who turns out to be a gold prospector, suggests they use a raft and float the five days downriver to Riberalta, gateway to points beyond. “No harm can come to you,” he insists.

Initially they dismiss the man’s plan as crazy. But the prospect of no exit emboldens the pair. So they find a sturdy raft, made from four logs lashed together, and construct a tent of plastic sheeting atop it. “If you stay in the middle of the river,” they’re advised, “you’ll get there faster.” They are also cautioned under no circumstances to go for a swim. Why? Because “the candiru,” a minuscule saw-toothed fish, “swim up your butt and latch onto your intestines, suck your blood until you die.” Armed with this knowledge and little else, they set out in high spirits. “The river was faster than a galloping horse,” FitzGerald writes. “We joked about which of us was Huck Finn.”

Trouble arrives that first night. Unable to steer the raft in the powerful current, they miss the border checkpoint into Bolivia and shots tear through the darkness into their makeshift tent. But soon the days and nights are blissful. “I don’t know when I’ve ever felt so liberated,” FitzGerald recalls.

Photo

Then, on the fourth night, a drenching lightning storm hits. A tree collapses on the raft, missing FitzGerald’s head by inches. They almost sink in the tempest but manage to escape. Dawn brings the discovery that their raft has been taken far off course — they’re stranded deep in a swamp that rises during the rainy season. Worse, their supply of food has been lost.

In this world of water, the FitzGeralds struggle in vain to find their way back to the river’s current. They endure fire ants, suffer sunstroke and nearly drown in sucking mud. They sleep in a tree. Fear of attack by caiman, jaguar and piranha is constant. Strange glowing eyes peer at them nightly from the jungle. Bees swarm over every inch of their bodies — something they become nearly immune to.

And they starve, for page after harrowing page, for 26 days, until they are come upon — near death, emaciated — by two Indians out hunting for turtles. The couple endure, maintaining hope and affection for each other. It’s this that elevates “Ruthless River” above the typically heroic tale of survival. In simple, unsentimental terms, Holly FitzGerald has given us a most unlikely love story.

Love is just one of the things on the minds of the writers whose stories appear in THE BEST WOMEN’S TRAVEL WRITING, Volume 11: True Stories From Around the World (Travelers’ Tales, paper, $19.95). For more than 20 years, Travelers’ Tales has been publishing books that might best be described as the literary equivalent of a group of travelers sitting around a dim cafe, sipping pints or prosecco and trading their best stories. With more than a hundred titles currently in print, this publisher has carved out a valuable niche in the travel world.

The latest book’s editor, Lavinia Spalding, hungry for travelers who “go with an open heart” and have “the inclination to practice human kindness, a sincere intention to build pathways of understanding and a willingness to be transformed,” read nearly 500 submissions before settling on the 31 stories that make up this diverse collection.

In the opener, Zora O’Neill finds herself drawn away from a resort’s placid blue waters and toward the newly formed refugee camps that have sprung up on the Greek island she and her family visit every year. Like so many of the stories here, “On the Migrant Trail” is told with simple grace. O’Neill’s account demonstrates once again that history’s first draft is often written by the intrepid traveler.

In a different vein, Samantha Schoech offers a hilarious yet ultimately disquieting yarn about spending a week in Venice — sans children and husband — with a gal pal and having perhaps too fine a time. Pam Mandel, in a poignant essay, deals with grief in — of all places — Waikiki. And a trip to Singapore reminds Abbie Kozolchyk of that most important of all travel maxims — call your mother.

In NOURISHED: A Memoir of Food, Faith, and Enduring Love (With Recipes) (Convergent, $26), Lia Huber, a food writer and recipe developer, leaves the “meat-and-potatoes” safety of her Midwestern upbringing and sets out on a quixotic path of self-discovery.

As a young woman, she is led by her hunger for enlightenment to the island of Corfu. There she falls in love for the first time — not only with a man but, after an epiphany at the sight of an egg fried in olive oil, with the deep pleasures of good food simply prepared. Upon her return to America, health problems force her further in the direction of conscious eating, and her fate is sealed at a San Francisco farmers’ market “one Saturday morning in spring when a farmer held out a pea to me and changed my world.”

Huber is prone to such pronouncements and the reader might be excused for slipping into cynicism, except for Huber’s wholehearted belief in her path. Finding her soul mate, Christopher, she sets out to make a career of her ardor for food. Passion carries the day over pragmatism and the two — victims of wanderlust — are off to Costa Rica, Paris, Guatemala, Italy, even Minnesota. Eventually Huber meets a man who might be called — to slip into the parlance of this charming foodie’s travel memoir — her guardian angel, the chef Bruce Aidells, who magically appears at key moments and helps Huber land a job as a recipe tester.

Although Huber wears her zeal and her spiritual beliefs on her sleeve as she moves from one inspiration to the next, she’s endearing, engaging company and the reader roots for her success. Eventually Huber and Christopher adopt a baby, victories begin to accumulate, and the three approach a happy ending that Huber knows is merely another new beginning in her larger journey.

Finally, in THE ROMANCE OF ELSEWHERE (Counterpoint, $26), the South African-born Lynn Freed offers nearly two dozen essays from a life influenced by the road. A traveler deep down in her soul, Freed says her “dreams of displacement” began “in childhood.” As a young mother, she even became a travel agent in order to hide from her family her need for escape.

“There has always been romance in distance,” she reminds us. Yet it’s the push-pull of the desire to leave coupled with the “strong attachment to the comfort, the privacy, the intimacy, and the pride of home” that has shaped Freed’s life. “The rhythm of leaving and returning has kept me nicely unsettled for over 45 years.” Without it, she confesses, “I would have drowned any desire to write in restlessness and despair.”

Freed approaches the world — and her prose — with the cleareyed, forthright wonder required of the most committed of travelers. In the essay “Keeping Watch,” she recalls growing up “luxurious but not rich, safe and yet threatened, carefree if one did not think too carefully about the future,” in apartheid-era South Africa, and of her childhood terrors at the prospect of a “Knife-at-the-Throat day” when the servants might “rise as one.”

Elsewhere she speaks eloquently of travel’s power to transform: “The traveling writer is someone seeking … a sort of non-existence, the quest for which can lead, paradoxically, to the discovery of the self set free from the bafflement of context.” And in the deceptively economic essay called “Locked In,” she reminds us just how perilous it sometimes is to be a woman in the world, no matter how seemingly placid the setting.

Freed is also one of the funniest writers around. And in “Useful Zulu Phrases, 1986,” the laugh gets caught in the throat as she offers a hilarious list of some of the helpful hints that were once offered white South Africans attempting to learn Zulu in order to better command and control their black servants. In “Caveat Viator,” she gives us a blistering, bone-true indictment of new age man’s self-aggrandizing struggles to be at harmony with the natural world — from Northern California to Africa.

In this marvelous collection’s final essay, “When Enough Is Enough,” Freed may be speaking for road warriors everywhere when she confesses to the occasional urge to “flee the things and the people that seem to hold me in place, to grab what’s left of the life and make a run for it.”",Travel Books Take You There and Back,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/books/review/travel-writing-women-border-kapka-kassabova.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

With a wood stove burning in one corner, the room inside was fragrant and warm. Members of the renowned Théâtre du Soleil milled about, noshing on a simple spread — a tray of baguettes, a plate of soft butter, a pot of jam. It had been months since the actors had performed “A Room in India,” a play that is, as the company’s work tends to be, a multi-hour event. They needed some rehearsal before taking the show to New York, where it is slated to run Dec. 5 through Dec. 20 at the Park Avenue Armory.

But their quick morning meeting was scarcely over when Ms. Mnouchkine (pronounced noosh-KEEN) took me aside to brief me on a troubling wrinkle in their travel plan: Of the 35 actors, three — all Afghan-born men, recently naturalized as French citizens — had yet to get their visas.

The company’s New York trip is meant to be a return to the triumphant scene of its most recent American visit, in 2009. The Théâtre du Soleil made its Armory debut then as part of the Lincoln Center Festival with “Les Éphémères,” a marathon in two parts, each more than three hours long. In The New York Times, the critic Charles Isherwood deemed it “haunting,” extolling performances “of that sublime but unshowy order generally only achieved by true theatrical collectives.”

Yet Ms. Mnouchkine, 78, told the Armory that if the “Room in India” visas were not all approved — if “we don’t undo this terrible knot,” she said to me in English — the company would not perform.

Would she truly risk everything that was at stake, though? The cost of transporting the production (already the sets and costumes were en route to the United States, with the company to follow as scheduled), the relationship with the Armory, the many tickets that have been sold?

That voice.

We have an incredible coach, William Conacher, who is in charge of everyone’s voice, which gives the show a tone. That’s so integral to the character, because the way she speaks and uses her mouth and expresses herself has so much to do with her physicality. It’s extraordinary how much the voice is the person and the person is the voice.

You’ve said that you’d now like to play someone who expresses herself.

That was tongue-in-cheek. But I would love to do something that is all about singing and dancing and just getting it out — not for anyone else’s enjoyment, but just purely for me to sit there and sing “Send in the Clowns.”

Are you any good?

Absolutely terrible. I can act my way through a song, but I do not have a voice of an angel.

So you won’t be singing and dancing as Janet Armstrong, the wife of Neil, in Damien Chazelle’s “First Man”?

I wish, but no, not for me anyway. It’s about the moon landing and what drives people to make certain decisions and behave in certain ways.

You’re following Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara to play Lisbeth Salander in “The Girl in the Spider’s Web.” Will there be a physical transformation?

We are honoring the character, but at the same time I don’t want it to be, “Look at me with my piercings.” But what a tribe of women to join. It’s such an opportunity to explore the abuse and what it means to be a woman who doesn’t conform and who actually has so much pathological behavior that she’s unaware of.

She seems pretty expressive.

It was in hopes of bringing more clarity to the increasingly tangled question of how endurance training affects hearts that researchers from the University of Minnesota, Stanford University and other institutions decided, for the new study, to zero in on a unique group of runners: men who had participated in at least 25 consecutive Twin Cities marathons in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

These 50 runners, identified by marathon participation logs, turned out to have completed, collectively, 3,510 marathons, with each runner, individually, having finished anywhere from 27 to 171 of the races.

The men obviously were experienced endurance athletes. They had trained for at least 26 years, and some for more than 50. Many had started competing in high school or earlier, but others had come to the sport much later, often, the researchers report, in hopes of ameliorating the effects of past lifestyle choices, such as smoking or junk food diets. Most were lean at the time of the study, but a few qualified as overweight, based on their body mass indexes.

Most ran 30 miles per week or more.

The researchers had each of these runners fill out detailed questionnaires about their training routines, as well as their general health history and habits.

Then they scanned the runners’ hearts to look for atherosclerosis.

Sixteen of the runners proved to have no plaque in their arteries at all. The rest had some deposits, with 12 displaying slight amounts, another 12 moderate levels, and 10 having worrisomely large deposits of plaques.

When the scientists compared the men’s running histories to their scan results, however, they found little relationship between how much they had run overall and how much plaque they had in their arteries. Those men who had run the greatest number of marathons did not tend to have less, or more, arterial plaque than the men who had run fewer races, indicating that extreme running itself had not increased the severity of heart disease.

On the other hand, a history of heavy smoking and high cholesterol was linked to greater levels of plaque, especially in the men who had begun running later in life.

The good news was that these findings suggest that years of hard running had not harmed the men’s hearts, says Dr. William O. Roberts, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of Minnesota, who led the study, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Indeed, all that running probably helped to keep some runners’ arteries clear.

But the exercise also had not inoculated those with a history of unwise lifestyle choices, especially smoking, against developing heart disease.

“You can’t just outrun your past,” Dr. Roberts says.

Of course, this study was relatively small and focused on Caucasian men with the physical, economic and psychological wherewithal to run competitively for years. Whether the results apply equally to other people and other sports is unclear. (Dr. Roberts and his collaborators published a small study earlier this year of female marathon runners that found almost no plaques in their hearts.)

This type of study also can show only relationships between running and heart health. It cannot prove that running directly caused any changes in the heart.

Still, the results may help to quell some runners’ and their families’ worries about the cardiac demands of long-term training. But if you misspent your youth smoking and eating poorly or have a family history of cardiac disease, you might want to talk with your physician about having your heart assessed, Dr. Roberts says, even if you have completed a marathon or two, or even 100.",How Running May or May Not Help the Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/well/move/running-marathons-heart-health.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — We get a lot of questions about how clues are written for different days of the week, and Kevin Der returns with a puzzle that is not only packed with really lively entries and a whopping 11 debuts, but also provides us with an interesting analysis on how late week clues are written.

Also, some completely unrelated thoughts on speed solving from me. Many solvers like to speed solve and that’s great. You do you. Beating your personal best or the personal best of your frenemy is fun, but please don’t compare yourself to the people who solve competitively. That’s the best way to discourage yourself when you’re building up a new skill. Humor writer Bill Scheft is currently learning this lesson.

The whole point of solving a crossword puzzle, unless you are competing in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, is to enjoy the wordplay and learn something. That’s really it. When you rush through a puzzle, you miss the good stuff.

So I’m going to propose that we look at crossword solving the same way we look at physical training. When you are training at a gym or learning a new sport, you never do the same kind of training every day. Some days you do weight work, some days you focus on increasing your aerobic capacity. It’s the same with improving your solving: On some days, focus on learning to read the clues and understand their intent. On other days, challenge yourself to get your speed up with some easy, early week puzzles. Solve with a partner, because another brain may be able to solve things you don’t know, and they keep you honest. And, of course, remember to stay hydrated.

作为一名前华盛顿公设辩护人，福尔曼以娴熟的手法记述了从70年代开始，一代黑人官员如何奋力解决美国首都反复出现的暴力和毒品危机。一开始是一场意在彰显黑人生命价值的行动，后来演变成了严厉打击犯罪的政策，给这些官员本来承诺代表的社区造成了毁灭性的后果。福尔曼认为，废除美国大规模监禁制度需要重新理解正义。后者强调的是责任而不是复仇。

《草原之火——劳拉·英戈尔斯·怀尔德的美国梦》(Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder)

卡罗琳·弗雷泽(Caroline Fraser)著

这本传记的主人公的作品包括《草原小屋》(Little House on the Prairie)和其他一些回忆作者在西迁时期的童年生活的作品。弗雷泽捕捉到了这位作家被虚构作品巧妙掩盖的生活，和一段不可思议的标志性文学生涯的细节。本书做了全面的研究，字里行间洋溢着热情，刷新了我们对美国西部历史的理解，也为讲述其他人的故事提供了空间，这其中有英戈尔斯家这样将美国原住民从部落领地赶走的白人定居者，也有公地开垦者、农场主和其他所有冲着这里难以捉摸的财富而来的人。结尾处，弗雷泽对怀尔德和女儿罗丝·怀尔德·莱恩(Rose Wilder Lane)在20世纪转向右翼政治进行了颇有见地的分析，为思考国家神话是如何形成的提供了一个非常广阔的角度。

《神父老爸》(Priestdaddy)

帕特丽夏·洛克伍德(Patricia Lockwood)著

在这本深情而又十分有趣的回忆录里，洛克伍德将她家族的故事——包括她的父亲，一位获得梵蒂冈特批豁免的罗马天主教神父——和她自己的成长，以及一场导致她和丈夫被迫暂时进入神父居所与父母同住的危机——穿织成了一个故事。她还运用诗人的天赋，将神圣和粗俗融入到一个让人信服而又纯正的美妙声音之中。通过这本书，洛克伍德证明了她是一位极具天赋、能够随心所欲的作家。",《纽约时报》2017年度十大好书,https://cn.nytstyle.com/culture/20171201/10-best-books-2017/

THE RAW PENTHOUSE at 551 West 21st Street was acquired through the limited liability company 551 Chelsea. Erin Boisson Aries, of Brown Harris Stevens, was the listing broker. Monthly carrying costs for the apartment total $27,295.

The 44-unit, concrete-and-glass building is in the heart of Chelsea’s art district, near 11th Avenue, and about a block from the High Line. Developed by SR Capital, the structure was designed by Mr. Foster’s architectural firm, Foster + Partners, and Beyer Blinder Belle.

The high-rise has a private porte cochere and a lobby with a double-height ceiling. The building also has a host of luxury amenities, including a fitness center, spa, yoga room, children’s playroom and concierge services.

THE BANK AUCTION for the 79th-floor penthouse at One57, following a mortgage default, was the largest involving a single residence in New York, according to the real estate data firm Property Shark, which keeps track of foreclosures in the city. The auction was originally scheduled for July, but postponed to early November. The lien amount on the property, Property Shark said, was $28.72 million, plus interest and costs. The apartment’s monthly carrying costs are $15,169.

According to property records, the sale of the condo, which has four bedrooms and four and a half baths, closed in mid-November. The new owner’s identity was shielded by the limited liability company S7AL.

The apartment was first purchased in January 2015 for $50.92 million by Kolawole Akanni Aluko, a Nigerian businessman, under the entity One57 79 Inc. (The unit was re-listed briefly in the spring of 2015 for $57 million.) Property records show that a mortgage for $35.34 million was taken out by the company with Banque Havilland of Luxembourg.

Mr. Aluko has been accused by the United States Department of Justice of bribery and money laundering, and last summer the agency filed a civil suit seeking to recover assets he held, including the penthouse and a yacht valued at $80 million.

THE SALES IN TURTLE BAY included a five-story, 19-foot-wide townhouse at 236 East 49th Street, in the Turtle Bay Gardens Historic District. It was bought for $8.25 million by Mr. Rudd, who twice served as the Australian prime minister, from 2007 to 2010 and in 2013.

The house has 5,690 square feet with five bedrooms, four full and two half baths, along with 1,000 square feet of outdoor space that includes a south-facing garden, two terraces and a balcony. The full-floor master suite on the third story features a large bath with a connected dressing room.

The condo acquired by Ms. Grossman and her husband is unit No. 29A at 50 United Nations Plaza, another new development designed by Mr. Foster. The closing price was $5.65 million; it was listed for $6.8 million. The 2,609-square-foot condo has three bedrooms and three baths, with views of the East River and United Nations. Ms. Grossman, formerly the chief executive of the Home Shopping Network, took over the helm of Weight Watchers earlier this year.

THE ESTATE OF MS. GOLDSMITH, who died in 2016 at 85, sold her co-op at 550 Park Avenue, at East 62nd Street, for $15 million. The unit, No. 17E, has four bedrooms and three and a half baths, along with an office, library and large eat-in kitchen.

Ms. Goldsmith was the author of several books, including “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” about the bitter 1934 custody battle over Gloria Vanderbilt.

IN THE WEST VILLAGE, Mr. Grace, the actor, whose full name is Christopher John Grace, sold unit No. 4 at 59 Bank Street, a boutique condominium. The price was $4.2 million. The apartment has two bedrooms and two and a half baths over 1,858 square feet.

Mr. Symon, who has appeared regularly on several Food Network shows, and his wife sold their townhouse at 58 Downing Street for $5.43 million. The three-story red brick building has three bedrooms and three baths.

Yet it comes across like an interpolated concert aria, suggesting both the strengths and shortcomings of this ambitious new opera.","The opera opens with Clarence, a hearty miner (the exuberant bass-baritone Ryan McKinny), who sets up the story almost as if giving a lecture.

“It was a driving, vigorous, restless population,” Mr. McKinny sings lustily over skittish, pointillist music in the orchestra. “Not dainty, simpering kid-gloved weaklings, but muscular, stalwart, dauntless young braves.” (The words come from Mark Twain’s “Roughing It.”)

When Ned (the charismatic young bass-baritone Davóne Tines) first appears, he describes himself in the third person: “Ned Peters was a hustler from Independence town,” Mr. Tines sings in virile, restless phrases. Most of Ned’s words come from the journals of fugitive slaves.

For “Doctor Atomic,” the previous collaboration between Mr. Adams and Mr. Sellars, which had its premiere here in 2005, Mr. Sellars also assembled a libretto from poetry, journals and original documents. Though the results had awkward aspects, that opera maintained a strong narrative impetus: Its plot was driven by a countdown to the first detonation of a nuclear bomb.

Mr. Sellars’s patched-together approach doesn’t work as well for “Girls,” a work that cavalierly invites comparisons with Puccini’s “La Fanciulla del West” (“The Girl of the West”), an Italian’s take on the Gold Rush. The historical Dame Shirley was a fascinating woman with a pioneering spirit. But her story gets lost amid what comes across as a bold attempt to write the great California opera — a sweeping tale of the mad quest for fortune that was the mostly disastrous Gold Rush.

Some exciting stretches, conducted with crackling energy and color by Grant Gershon, certainly convey the teeming wildness, racial animosity and lawless violence that roiled the West. The rugged miners sing words taken from actual miners’ songs, set to rhythmically fractured music, enlivened with accordion and cow bells. The tenor Paul Appleby gives a dynamic performance as Joe Cannon, a miner who leaves behind a girl in Missouri, who then abandons him to marry a butcher back home, as Joe learns during a boisterous scene in a bar full of drunken miners. Joe finds comfort with a Chinese prostitute, Ah Sing (the brilliant coloratura soprano Hye Jung Lee), who decides that Joe, a client, would also make an ideal mate.

Two compelling singers, the baritone Elliot Madore and the mezzo-soprano J’Nai Bridges, bring poignant intensity to the roles of Ramón and Josefa, a young Mexican couple who work at the bar. Ramón smolders with rage, fearing that at any moment, the Americans could turn on him or abuse Josefa, a fear that leads to the opera’s harrowing conclusion. But Ramón’s words mostly come from the Gold Rush diary of a South American journalist, and Josefa’s from an Argentine poet. Even during moments of romance, in Mr. Adams’s hazy, shimmering music, the lovers sound as if they were mere mouthpieces, singing past each other.

Mr. Adams and Mr. Sellars might have opted for a middle-ground approach and folded a few of Shirley’s letters, like the revealing one about the Native Americans, along with other poems and speeches, into a libretto that told a clearer story.

During the second act, the encampment celebrates the Fourth of July. The enormous stump of a sequoia (one of many striking elements of David Gropman’s sets) becomes a makeshift stage for entertainments.

At one point, Mr. Tines’s Ned mounts the stump to sing a stinging aria based on “What to a Slave Is the Fourth of July?” — a bitterly powerful 1852 speech by Frederick Douglass. It’s a tour de force moment for Mr. Tines and, in a way, for Mr. Adams.

People here also have no illusions about the overall effect of global warming. They see the waters rising and worry about sea mammals disappearing. They rely on the sea for food, and their year is built around festivals for berry picking and whaling.

“Inupiaq people are taught to be patient,” said Steve Oomittuk, a leading local whale hunter whose family has lived in Point Hope for many generations. “We wait for animals to come to us for our food, our shelter, our medicine, our clothing. The internet makes people impatient for everything. This is not our way of life.”

But interviews with dozens of Point Hope residents suggest that people here see Quintillion’s cable as a way of connecting with an outside world that has long been beyond easy reach — and something that could change their lives for the better.

Leona Snyder, for one, is excited about what the connection could do for her Justice Jones, who turns 16 on Sunday. She wants him to go to college, which would mean leaving the village.

My phone camera has gotten me interested in photography, but I’m afraid of the learning curve on an expensive digital S.L.R. What’s the easiest way to get started?

A. Moving up to a digital single-lens reflex camera (D.S.L.R.) is a big step from the relative simplicity of using a smartphone camera. However, it can be rewarding if you want higher-quality pictures, more control over how your images look and to learn more about the technical aspects of photography. But you should plan time to educate yourself on how the camera works and be prepared to spend at least a few hundred dollars on equipment, including for the camera body and interchangeable lenses.

Before you plunk down the money for expensive gear, do some research on popular models and check out the user reviews to get an idea of how D.S.L.R. cameras work. Visiting a camera shop or electronics store with display models to sample can give you a feel for using the bigger devices.

If you are shopping for an entry-level D.S.L.R., Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, recommends the $500 Nikon D3400 as the best D.S.L.R. for beginners thanks to image quality, ease of use and other factors — including Bluetooth connectivity for wirelessly sharing photos to a smartphone with the SnapBridge app. To get started, Nikon’s site offers a $15 online course on the basics of using its cameras. Classes on more advanced topics are also available in Nikon’s online school, and some areas host in-person photography courses as well.

If you find D.S.L.R. cameras too intimidating, other options for higher-quality pictures include smaller, lighter midrange mirrorless cameras like the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II (around $600) or advanced point-and-shoot compact cameras like the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX10 (available for around $600).

With top Olympics officials expected imminently to announce a punishment for Russia over its elaborate sports doping scheme, the whistle-blower who played a central role in the illicit program said he was in favor of allowing Russian athletes who can establish their innocence to compete under a neutral flag at the coming Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

“Innocent athletes should not be prevented from participating,” Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia’s former longtime antidoping laboratory chief, said in an email exchange on Friday and Saturday with The New York Times through his lawyer — his first interview since being put under protection of United States authorities.

International Olympic Committee officials will announce Tuesday how they will handle the matter of Russia’s eligibility at the Winter Games in February.

Dr. Rodchenkov said he supported one of the options that the officials are considering: allowing clean Russian athletes to compete but keeping all Russian emblems out of the Games.

In recent weeks, Dr. Rodchenkov’s detailed account about widespread breaches of drug-testing controls at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia — as well as his contemporaneous notes from that time and digital evidence related to his lab work — have been shared with Olympic officials.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — You may have wondered: Why doesn’t Will Shortz simply make and edit every puzzle himself? Why can anyone submit a puzzle to The New York Times? While it’s true that Mr. Shortz would have a much tougher time churning out consistently high-quality work, the real reason stems from the variety that different constructors’ voices can provide.

Today’s puzzle by Sam Trabucco is an excellent illustration of this point. Check out some of the answers that his grid is built around: the OTTER PUP / PUH-LEASE / UBERPOOL stack, the Pokémon-inspired GOTTA CATCH EM ALL, the HA HA HA / YEAH DUDE commentary and the fan favorite CHASE UTLEY.

Not only are the answers above ideal for a themeless puzzle, but they appear to convey Mr. Trabucco’s voice; it’s as if he’s right there watching us solve. Isn’t that neat? While I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Trabucco once in person, I feel I know a lot more about his interests after completing his puzzle. And this is just one constructor’s output; with nearly 900 contributors since Mr. Shortz began in 1993, it’s no wonder we see so many different kinds of entries that inspire both themed and themeless grids.

Of course, this discussion should not detract from Mr. Trabucco’s work here today. There is so much to like in his 70-word grid, and I learned things like ARM BAR and “The Last Emperor,” too. Personally, I found it easier than yesterday’s themeless, yet I understand why it was slotted as a Saturday rather than Friday: several answers here are trivia-based. Either you know UBERPOOL or you don’t. Same deal with GOTTA CATCH EM ALL, DATA TYPE and CHASE UTLEY. It also explains why their clues are so straightforward; the solver will have an easier way in.

Constructor Notes

The Sherlock Holmes stories generate lovely acrostic-length passages. In December 2000 we featured this from “His Last Bow”: “His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his … revolver practice within doors, his weird … scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of … danger … around him … made him the very worst tenant in London.” And as recently as 2014 we lifted this from “The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual”: “Although … methodical … [he] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very center of his wooden mantelpiece.” Now we’ll give the old sleuth a break for a spell.

The provision would lower rates for taxpayers simply if their businesses are organized as partnerships or other entities whose tax burdens flow to the individual. Half of that type of income goes to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to the Tax Policy Center. In total, that tax cut will cost the government about $476 billion over the coming decade.

Not all types of income would be eligible for the newly reduced rate. Short-term capital gains, dividends, interest and annuity payments, for example, are excluded. But the list of earnings that do qualify was expanded from earlier Republican proposals in the Senate.

Investments in mortgages held by real estate investment trusts would be able to take advantage of the lower pass-through rate instead of being taxed at ordinary income rates, which are higher.

Thanks to an amendment offered by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, certain income from gas and oil operators could also qualify for the new, lower rate. Industry representatives said they would have been excluded from the intended benefits that the real estate investment trusts and other publicly traded industries were getting.

“The Senate went out of its way to confirm that passive investors in these publicly traded investment vehicles get the benefit of the pass-through discount tax rate,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “This is a working definition of a tax boondoggle.”

Offshore Tax Break

A provision to give multinational companies like Pfizer, Google and Apple a tax break on the profits they have accumulated in offshore tax havens was made less generous than earlier versions of the proposal. But the companies would still bring those earnings home at rates of 7.5 to 14.5 percent — well below the existing corporate income tax rate of 35 percent and also lower than the new corporate income tax rate, which the bill would cut nearly in half to 20 percent. This break will still save the companies roughly half a trillion dollars compared with current law, according to an estimate by the Zion Research Group.

Banks Avoid a Hit

Banks and other financial institutions will still be able to avoid taxes by making payments to offshore subsidiaries. The lawmakers had initially intended to prevent the tax benefits from such actions, but the banks got a last-minute reprieve for some transactions. In calculating the companies’ tax bills, the bill excludes payments related to derivatives, a big source of income for financial institutions.

Some last-minute changes were smaller and more peculiar: The federal tax code includes limits on how much interest companies can deduct from their taxes. But the bill now excludes from those restrictions interest paid by car dealerships.

Alternative Minimum Tax Confusion

The bill extends so-called bonus depreciation — the ability to take big deductions related to certain corporate investments — at a cost of $34 billion, but pays for it by reinstating the corporate alternative minimum tax. The last-minute decision to scrap the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax left lawyers and accountants scratching their heads about the ultimate impact. Several experts said it appeared unintentional that the benefit of the tax credit for research and experimentation could effectively be lost. The provision is dear to many businesses.

“Oops,” said Mr. Looney of the Brookings Institution. “That’s an easy mistake to make on a first pass, but which you’d catch if you had more time.”

Family Leave Credit, but Not for Everyone

At least one Republican proposal floated for weeks made it into the final bill, but seemingly in a form designed to punish taxpayers in Democratic states. Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, introduced an employee credit for paid family and medical leave. But the final version doesn’t apply to employers in states where such paid leave is either required — or will soon be required — by state law, as in New York, California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. It also doesn’t apply to employees making more than $72,000 and will last only until the end of 2019.

“So in sum, we’ve got a short-term fertility incentive for lower/middle-income employees, as long as you don’t live in too blue a state,” Daniel Hemel, a professor of tax law at the University of Chicago, wrote on Twitter.

Hits for Low-Income Earners

While wealthy investors and business would receive numerous tax cuts — including eliminating the estate tax for all but a tiny sliver of the country’s wealthiest households — the Senate moved to tighten deductions for lower- and middle-income wage earners. The bill, for example, prohibits employers from rewarding employees with gift cards so that a reward of, say, $25 or $50 in the form of a gift card doesn’t escape being taxed.

At the same time, a provision to fund the I.R.S. so that it could offer advice to low-income filers was rejected in the final bill.

Although the bill expands the child tax credit by a year to 17-year-olds, that change ends at the end of 2024, a year before other individual tax cuts are scheduled to expire — so families with children born in 2008 will see that credit end when their children are still 16.

Subsidy for Private and Religious Schools

In the early morning hours on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence cast a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment to allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts for private and religious schools and some home schooling. Under current law, 529 accounts can be used only for higher education.","Tax Bill Offers Last-Minute Breaks for Developers, Banks and Oil Industry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/business/tax-bill-offers-last-minute-breaks-for-developers-banks-and-oil-industry.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Turner faced as much as 14 years in prison.

He lost his swimming scholarship to Stanford and had to register as a sex offender in Ohio, his home state.

The sentence was criticized as egregiously lenient, prompting an effort to recall Judge Persky. Mr. Turner served three months in jail and was released on Sept. 2, 2016.

“The jury heard the evidence and decisively rejected Turner’s efforts to blame the victim,” Michele Dauber, a professor of law at Stanford and the chairwoman of a committee to recall Judge Persky, said on Saturday. “The problem with this case is not that Judge Persky was unfair to Brock Turner, it’s that Judge Persky was unfair to the victim.”

The 22-year-old victim, who was not a Stanford student, was attacked after a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity. Two Stanford graduate students who were bicycling came upon the assault, according to court records. When Mr. Turner began to flee, they chased him, tackled him and held him for the police.

The victim has said she does not recall the assault. She said she was told she had been found behind a Dumpster, and learned from news reports that the witnesses discovered her attacker on top of her unconscious, partly clothed body.

Mr. Turner’s appeal takes issue with the prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci’s many references to the Dumpster during the trial, particularly her repeated use of the phrase “behind the Dumpster.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The appeal said the use of the phrase “implied an intent on the appellant’s part to shield” his activities from others and “implied moral depravity, callousness, and culpability on the appellant’s part because of the inherent connotations of filth, garbage, detritus and criminal activity frequently generally associated with Dumpsters.”

The victim and Mr. Turner were found in a three-sided structure that customarily houses a Dumpster. They were discovered on an open side, facing a darkened basketball court. The fraternity house faced the other side.

The graduate students approached from the basketball court side, meaning Mr. Turner and the victim were not obscured, the brief said.

A request for comment from Ms. Kianerci was not immediately returned on Saturday.

Mr. Turner was convicted of sexual assault of an unconscious person, sexual assault of an intoxicated person and sexual assault with intent to commit rape.

In a statement submitted to the court before his sentencing, Mr. Turner insisted that the sexual encounter was consensual, but he did admit to “imposing trauma and pain” on the victim.

At Mr. Turner’s sentencing, the victim read a lengthy statement.

“This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making,” she said in the statement. “Assault is not an accident.”

Mr. Turner’s father, Dan, was harshly criticized online after he made a statement saying that his son should not go to jail or have his life ruined for “20 minutes of action.”

A still-unresolved issue stemming from the case is the fate of Judge Persky, who sought in court to block signature-collection efforts calling for his ouster. That request was rejected on Friday by a state appellate court.

“We’re extremely pleased that the court of appeals turned down Judge Persky’s request for a stay,” Professor Dauber said. The committee she is leading has so far collected 76,000 signatures of the 90,000 needed to get on the June ballot.

Attempts on Saturday to reach Judge Persky, who is prohibited from commenting on the appeal because it is a pending case, were unsuccessful.

A very worthy, second New York Times Crossword outing from Lily Silverstein, with a central seed entry that will no doubt provoke some discussion. But that’s what we’re here for, isn’t it?

For those of you just joining us, a seed entry is a word or phrase that a constructor believes will make a lively start to the fill in a puzzle. The rest of the fill is built around it, and the seed entry typically gets a prominent place in the grid.

Today’s seed entry, according to Ms. Silverstein, is the central entry GENDER ROLES, clued as “Parts played on classic sitcoms?” Some solvers might discuss the entry because of the evolving nature of gender roles in society, but personally, I was more curious about the question mark at the end of the clue. It seemed to me that the clue would work just as well without a “?” but that was only on my first reading.

A “?” at the end of a clue typically means the clue cannot be taken at face value. It also means a clue is stretching beyond a single reality: Today, we’re not talking about literal roles or parts being played, but the fact that in old or “classic” sitcoms, people usually adhered to then-stereotypical gender roles, like the stay-at-home mom who raised the children or the beleaguered dad who worked outside the home. In an email, editor Will Shortz also remarked that “a secondary reason is the clue’s inexactness. It might not always be true. A question mark in a clue sometimes substitutes for ‘maybe’ or ‘perhaps.’”",A Story With an Apple,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2017-12-01.html

Likewise, Silicon Valley invests hundreds of billions of dollars in start-ups that it believes will deliver the best returns.
There are few senior women at the top venture capital firms.
Last year, of the approximately $60 billion that venture capital firms invested, just $1.5 billion went to businesses with female founders.
Investors in venture capital funds would have been as well off simply investing in the stock market over the past five to 15 years.","What we are only beginning to recognize is that demeaning and devaluing women is an insidious, expensive problem. It’s not just the eye-popping settlements in some cases, like the $32 million paid by Bill O’Reilly to settle a harassment claim. Nor is it just the high salaries network stars have been making while allegedly assaulting subordinates, like the $20 million, or more, for Matt Lauer. It only starts there.

The bigger cost derives from how women’s ideas are discounted and their talent ignored. I have seen it up close in the two worlds I know best: Wall Street, where I was chief executive of Smith Barney and of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and in Silicon Valley, where I’ve raised money to run my start-up, Ellevest. These places are perhaps the purest microcosms of capitalism, and their lessons are instructive for all of us.

Both Wall Street and venture capital are industries whose product is money: Wall Street directs trillions of dollars to the sectors or businesses that it believes will deliver the highest returns. Likewise, Silicon Valley invests hundreds of billions of dollars in start-ups that it believes will deliver the best returns. Both pick economic winners and losers.

Wall Street has for years prided itself on being a “meritocracy,” arguing that its performance-based culture drives capital to the best trading ideas and the best deals. Despite research showing that companies with more diversity, and particularly more women in leadership, offer higher returns on capital, lower risk and greater innovation than firms without such leadership, Wall Street has been, and is, predominantly male at the top. Its trading floors are 90 percent men. This ignores studies indicating that members of homogeneous groups tend to trust one another too much, leading to potential market mispricings.

Homogeneity has led Wall Street firms to travel in packs, going after the same opportunities at the same time: junk bonds in the 1980s, tech stocks in the late 1990s and subprime lending in the run-up to the crash 10 years ago. In particular, when the subprime bet proved wrong, the big banks went essentially bankrupt and were bailed out by the United States government because officials worried that the economic cost of their failure would have been catastrophic.

Thus one can draw a line from the gender discrimination on Wall Street through to the lack of women — and lack of diversity of thought — in the industry to increased risk and to the financial crisis.

Silicon Valley today is rife with parallels to Wall Street, its lessons unlearned. Like Wall Street, it prides itself on its meritocratic culture, arguing that its performance-based orientation will drive capital to the best start-ups. There are few senior women at the top venture capital firms. The industry funds few start-ups run by women. Last year, of the approximately $60 billion that venture capital firms invested, just $1.5 billion went to businesses with female founders.

One might argue that start-ups run by men just happen to deliver the highest possible returns. The mythology around the industry bolsters this, with venture capitalists boasting of investing in Facebook practically out of the dorm room.

But that argument doesn’t hold up. Investors in venture capital funds would have been as well off simply investing in the stock market over the past five to 15 years. That’s what I see in reviewing the data from the research firm Cambridge Associates: Investors in the high-risk, high-reward world of start-ups essentially did no better than they could have opening an account at their neighborhood brokerage. What might help those venture capitalists? First Round Capital reports that its investments in companies with a female founder have posted 63 percent better returns than men-only firms.

Venture capital and Wall Street are both funded by “other people’s money.” Pension funds, endowments, mutual funds and individual investors provide the fuel that enables this sexist, exclusionary behavior. The irony is that so many of these endowments and foundations exist to make the world a fairer place, not to exclude vast segments of the population. Yet because their money is tied up in industries where women’s perspectives, and diversity of viewpoints, aren’t valued on the whole, their causes — and their bottom lines — lose out.

This moment of ferreting out sexual harassers is a step forward. It also reveals how much work we have to do on the biases that allowed such behavior to flourish.

This summer, I was in Silicon Valley, pitching for a round of funding for my company. I was the only woman in a room of 18 venture capitalists. A few of the men were engaged, a few were typing on their iPhones, and the lead investor was alternating between peppering me with questions and leaning back in his chair with his arms folded. He challenged my knowledge on digital acquisition, on acquisition costs.

Fair enough, even if he was being a little prickly. Finally, I noted that our business was planning to hire a few financial advisers. He proceeded to give me chapter and verse on how financial advisers are hard to manage and instructed me on the economics of the financial advisory business.

I was astonished, because I have managed more financial advisers in my career than probably anyone in the country. And though it’s been years since I have been sexually harassed the way I was at Salomon, I realized in that moment how deep our gender views run, how men are still seen as leaders and women as more junior.

This man naturally assumed that he knew more about it than I did. It was his ingrained view of women — a view that’s costing all of us.",The Cost of Devaluing Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/the-cost-of-devaluing-women.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Q. What causes Bell’s palsy?

A. Bell’s palsy is a temporary partial facial paralysis that occurs when the nerve controlling the facial muscles is inflamed. But identifying the underlying cause of the inflammation “is a question for the ages,” said Dr. Joseph Safdieh, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.

The current prevailing theory is that Bell’s palsy develops after a viral infection activates the immune system, Dr. Safdieh said, adding that “once the immune system is activated, it goes and attacks a nerve.” The condition usually affects only one side of the face, causing asymmetry or drooping on one side (the reason for that is not known either).

Some experts believe Bell’s palsy is related to the herpes simplex or common cold sore virus. But several large randomized controlled trials that compared treatment with antiviral agents and prednisolone, an oral steroid that suppresses the immune system, found the steroid to be most effective. The results reinforce the idea that the condition is caused by an immune system reaction rather than the virus itself, Dr. Safdieh said.

The condition has also been associated with recent vaccinations and upper respiratory infections, “but many people are vaccinated and have upper respiratory infections and don’t develop Bell’s palsy,” Dr. Safdieh said. “The ultimate answer is ‘we don’t know,’ but that many things that activate the immune system can trigger it.”

One specific cause that should be ruled out is Lyme disease, especially if Bell’s palsy develops in the summer or early fall or in children, in whom it is less common, Dr. Safdieh said. Treatment will differ if the patient has Lyme disease.

Bell’s palsy is also associated with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that involves other parts of the body as well and is more common in African-Americans; both pregnancy and diabetes increase the risk for Bell’s palsy.

Bell’s palsy is often treated with oral steroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone. The earlier treatment starts, the better, but “most patients have a complete recovery within three months,” Dr. Safdieh said, though sometimes symptoms last longer and, in rare cases, never completely disappear. The disorder may also recur.",What Causes Bell’s Palsy?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/well/live/what-causes-bells-palsy.html

After all, in the early 1980s, the political upheaval and violence in nearby El Salvador — where I was based — dominated the headlines. We should have kept covering the civil war there, the spokesman said, since there really wasn’t anything worth covering in Guatemala.

But that only hardened our resolve to take a closer look. We redoubled our efforts to report on the military and opposition groups ensnared in what would ultimately be a 36-year conflict that claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people, mostly indigenous Maya, between 1960 and 1996. Some 45,000 victims disappeared, while more than one million people were displaced. Yet this conflict raged on in relative obscurity and mystery, even as the 1980s ushered in an era of horrific violence.

Traveling by bus from Guatemala City and into the Quiché highlands to the northwest, the urban bustle gave way to a dramatic landscape of rolling, verdant hills, though the awe inspired by that vista was soon displaced by a sense of menace. Army checkpoints appeared 30 minutes outside of Chichicastenango, where bus and car passengers lined up to show identity papers. Foreign tourists were generally exempt from the low-level suspicion and harassment shown to the Maya.

I was familiar with Guatemala’s turbulent political history and the C.I.A.’s support of its 1954 coup. But I was relatively new to the daily terror tactics of Central America where U.S.-backed troops used fear and violence to contain a growing left-wing insurgency. But unlike in El Salvador, where the United States openly provided military advisers and equipment, American support for Guatemala’s military government was purposefully hidden and downplayed.

The military’s campaign of violence and terror was carried out with rigor and exactitude. The way to multiply a political murder’s horror was to leave corpses in full public view, like on the side of the road with a slit throat and torn-off clothing. “This could happen to you,” was the clear message sent to potential victims, warning them of the fate that awaited those suspected of supporting the rebels.

These weren’t peripheral incidents with marginal players but a closely-managed pacification campaign whose violent counterinsurgency tactics were supported by other right-wing anti-Communist countries and their military attachés and trainers in Guatemala. Taiwan provided anti-Communist psy-ops training; Argentina contributed counterintelligence and interrogation techniques from its own Dirty War; South Africa supplied communications equipment and training; while Israel provided weapons for the soldiers and infantry. A small number of Spanish-speaking U.S. Special Forces troops worked in the field and at military training camps.

In January 1982, I traveled with Christopher Dickey, The Washington Post’s correspondent, to the military headquarters in Santa Cruz del Quiché to speak with the Guatemalan Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Benedicto Lucas García. The French-trained general implemented a scorched-earth policy aimed at eliminating a growing insurgency in the indigenous areas of the western highlands. The rebellion was at its peak, and the Guatemalan guerrillas considered themselves allies of Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the leftist F.M.L.N in El Salvador.

The general invited Chris and me on a helicopter flight over the mountainous farming area of the Quiché, where they targeted the enemy with simple, deadly logic: Anyone running from our white Bell helicopter was either a guerrilla or a sympathizer.

Accompanied by two door-gunners and an intelligence officer, Gen. Lucas García sat in the co-pilot’s seat and directed the flight around the rural areas. We were 15 minutes from the provincial capital, flying about 1,500 feet, when he spotted a group of women running away from the approaching helicopter. He ordered the pilot to circle the farm below and bank the helicopter hard so the door gunners could have a better view.

Then he yelled out the command to open fire, “Dale! Dale!” — “Give it to them! Give it to them!”

The gunners blasted away in a hail of smoke and spent cartridges, the pilot turned and banked again, noisily circling above as civilians were cut down with the American-supplied M60 machine guns. Gen. Lucas García explained to us that since the campesinos (peasant farmers) had run away from the helicopter, they had to have been guilty. When The Washington Post published Chris’s story, Gen. Lucas García denied he ever ordered his men to fire, even though a photograph of the door-gunner in action (Slide 3) accompanied the story.

On various occasions in the early 1980s, I left El Salvador to work in Guatemala, photographing in the Ixil triangle and western highlands. I used a Rollei 2¼ camera, a tripod and black-and-white film. The film, from Todos Santos and Nebaj, had been in storage and mostly unseen since 1985.

At the time, the violence in the highlands was fearful, mysterious and intimidating. Asking villagers in Todos Santos and Nebaj to sit for a portrait, I felt the best I could hope for was a glimpse of their dignity and independence and what they were desperately trying to hold onto in the midst of the cruel, scorched-earth injustices and devastating military sweeps: Exactly what the blasé embassy spokesman had dismissively wanted us to overlook.

In six-inch platform stiletto boots, corset and Elizabethan collar, a tall and thin figure towered over the crowd like an alien monarch.

The music began — Röyksopp and Robyn’s dark synth ballad “Monument” — and the figure began to move long sleeves of pink fabric, folded into teardrop-shaped cavities, as if puppeteered, her gestures alternating between robotic and languid. As she raised her head, her face revealed pure black eyes, twice the size of a normal human’s, that extended down her cheeks and pointed toward a buglike mouth.

It was 2 a.m. in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. The beat dropped — “Make a cast of my body, pull back out so that I can see” — and she pulled away the mask that was her face. Beneath the mask? Identically inhuman features. Some gasped, others cheered.

The performance bore no sign of drag’s defining camp. It was somber, with no touch of melodrama. But it was undeniably drag: weird and apocalyptic, drag as seen through a cracked mirror.

The performer, who goes by the stage name Hungry (and who prefers female pronouns when referring to her drag persona), is the creation of a 24-year-old Berliner, Johannes Jaruraak. Over the past year, Hungry’s fame has grown, from a modest social media presence and devoted local followings in Berlin and London to international performances, high-profile editorial makeup assignments and 171,000 Instagram followers.

She is known for looks that showcase a manipulated anatomy: dropped eyes, foreshortened noses, lips airbrushed to appear ephemeral. A designer with couture experience, Mr. Jaruraak sews each constricting costume himself. On the October Saturday that she performed in Gowanus, Hungry wore two looks. She arrived in a sea-punk blue construction complete with moth-shaped fabric nose piece and fitted cap, and changed into a pale peach shell for her performance.

Hungry wasn’t the only attendee whose look invoked the post-human. Be Cute, a monthly drag night hosted by the Brooklyn-based queen Matty Mendoza, known as Horrorchata, bills itself as “a Dance Party for Homos and Aliens from Outer Space that like to shake it on the dance floor.” Amid the crowd, a lethal-looking goth kept company with a queen wearing angular makeup who defined her look as “darkness in a dream that you don’t want to leave.” Others wore arachnid-looking headpieces or unnaturally hued contact lenses.

Horrorchata, who is a founder of Bushwig, an annual alternative drag festival, said: “I would say in the last three years, a lot of people are going toward the creative side of drag. It used to be all about glamour and pageant and stuff like that, and now it’s like, it’s cool to be punk rock.”

Ryan Burke, a New York-based photographer and “look queen” (he doesn’t perform, and defines himself as a self-portrait artist rather than a drag performer), spearheaded the style in the United States around 2010, when he began to experiment with paper cutouts to exaggerate his eyebrows and lips. He’d document his own looks, and those put together by his friends, religiously. “Instagram wasn’t anything,” Mr. Burke said. “But I started putting them on Facebook first, and it became a whole thing.”

“After a year or two, people had been trying different things that I had been doing,” Mr. Burke said. “All of these new club kids started popping up as all kinds of different alien-looking things.” Though Mr. Burke grew up watching “Star Wars” and liking sci-fi, he arrived at his unique manner of distortion because he had little reference for drag. “I had no background in what I was doing. I didn’t know makeup, so I had to glue stuff on a lot,” he said.

He has since learned makeup. He has 130,000 Instagram followers and a second career as an editorial makeup artist. Since 2010, he has garnered fans and imitators, especially in Europe, where his science-fictional stripe of drag is particularly popular.

Other influential drag artists who work in parallel styles include Sad Salvia, a Britain-based artist with 102,000 Instagram followers, whose minimalist looks feature an extended lip and subtle horns, and Davide Zingarelli, known as DShock, whose faces are highly bejeweled and pierced (28,000 followers.) The Parisian D.I.Y. design duo Fecal Matter, while not explicitly drag performers, work in an analogous style.

What unites these artists is not only the shock value of their look, or their sizable roles as social media influencers in the drag scene, but that they represent a new moment in alternative drag, and express a gravely beautiful vision of what it means to be queer. The look that Hungry had termed “distorted drag” is outside any number of binaries: gender, culture and human as opposed to machine, animal or alien. The looks are somber but not sober. They invoke a sense of elegantly constrained chaos, a descent into dream logic. Their style is suited to the end of the world, or else the beginning of a new one.

Joe E. Jeffries, a drag historian and videographer who teaches a course on drag performance history at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, traces the look’s history straight to Leigh Bowery and the club kids of the 1980s, and to East Village drag performers like Flloyd. Performers including Hungry have taken that thread and “elevated it, burnished it,” he said.

“I think society is coming around to the idea that it’s not a gender binary, that it is not one or the other, that it can be anything in between,” Mr. Jeffries said. “It doesn’t even necessarily have to be all human, and that technology isn’t necessarily the other alternative — that it can be species and creatures that we haven’t even fantasized before.”

Hungry said, “With the gender aspect of it, it’s not as bound to anything anymore. It is very free. It is now just about the expression of gender without needing to specify what you identify as.”

In performance, Hungry didn’t connote man or woman, or even human. “I don’t see many boundaries anymore,” Hungry said. “I have a lot of friends, especially in London, who are female identifying and who do drag. They do it well, they perform well. It has the same value.”

As she moved, she appeared to exiting an invisible cocoon. Her “reveal” — still a trope in drag — was less a revelation than an admission that whoever Hungry is, and whatever the myth of Hungry means, she is not skin deep. Her look isn’t meant to imitate something foisted on her by the indecencies of society. Hungry’s distorted drag is interested in the deep wells of the self, a dream sequence that expresses the alien within.

“Wonder Wheel,” Woody Allen’s latest movie, is one of his more unfortunate contributions to cinema. It tells the story of a desperately, unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter, whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants, as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife, Soon-Yi, the daughter of his longtime ex, Mia Farrow. I tend to think it’s a bad idea to put a movie on the couch, but what if it climbs on the couch and then starts winking?

“Wonder Wheel” returns Mr. Allen to Coney Island, the childhood home of his alter ego Alvy Singer, the narrator of “Annie Hall” who claims to have grown up under the amusement park’s roller coaster. (“I have some trouble between fantasy and reality,” Alvy says.) In “Wonder Wheel,” the sad wife, Ginny (Kate Winslet), lives in an apartment that looks directly onto the park’s looming Ferris wheel. The attraction obscures her view of the ocean, literalizing already narrow horizons, and casts deep, expressionistic blue and red light on the apartment’s dilapidated interior and its equally worn inhabitants.

Ginny isn’t all used up, despite the insistently unflattering way she is often presented. She winces and frowns a lot, and the camera conspires with the lighting and makeup to catch every twitch of distress, and the sweaty, oily sheen she never seems able to blot away. It’s no surprise that she’s worried. She works in a clam house on the boardwalk, scrambling for hoi polloi, while back at home she has to juggle her loud, loutish husband, Humpty (Jim Belushi), and her son, Richie (Jack Gore). Like the young Alvy in “Annie Hall,” Richie is a redhead. But while Alvy is depressed about the universe, Richie seems largely troubled by his home life, specifically his demonstrably miserable mother.

So, when Mickey (Justin Timberlake, too modern a presence), a lifeguard and self-described romantic, gives Ginny the once over, she gratefully falls into his arms. “Wonder Wheel” more or less becomes Ginny’s story, but she doesn’t get to own it. The movie is narrated by Mickey, who pops in and out and looks directly into the camera. He has literary ambitions, as he likes to remind us, as well as a pad in Greenwich Village. For a while, Mickey offers Ginny a respite from her everyday grind, at least until the arrival of Carolina (a fine Juno Temple), Humpty’s daughter from an earlier marriage. She’s on the run from her gangster husband. “I know where all the bodies are buried,” Carolina says.

Somewhat of a cultural magpie, Mr. Allen has often folded bits and pieces — and at times entire conceits — from other work into his movies. Mickey mentions Eugene O’Neill, a reference that suggests we’re meant to see something of that playwright in Ginny and Humpty at their most raw and boozily fraught. Mr. Allen’s often blunt, overwrought dialogue, however, also alternately brings to mind Budd Schulberg (“I coulda been a contender”) and imitation Clifford Odets. In some scenes, you almost expect Mr. Belushi, who’s playing his heart out, to start bellowing about someone named Lefty.

据估计，90%的儿童性虐待案犯是熟人，其中30%是家人。陌生人仅占10%。

父母怎么才能帮助让孩子尽可能安全？

尽早进行身体意识的教育

在孩子咿呀学步时，就要在换尿布或洗澡时使用身体部位和生殖器的真实名称，并让他们知道，除了父母、私人看护和医生外，谁都不能触碰他们的私密部位。还要进一步解释，父母、私人看护和医生的触碰应该是短暂的，并且如果是看医生，应该有父母或其他成年人在场。

“越早教孩子他们的身体属于他们自己越好，”印第安纳大学(Indiana University)公共卫生教授、金赛研究所(Kinsey Institute)研究员黛比·赫尔贝尼克(Debby Herbenick)说。比如，当你胳肢孩子，孩子让你住手时，就住手。这一点同样适用于用身体表达爱意。“有时候，家长觉得必须让孩子拥抱或亲吻亲戚，但孩子不愿意。你可以提出建议，但如果孩子拒绝就算了。这会教孩子明白，如何表达喜爱由他们自己决定，不是为了让其他人感到舒服或高兴，或是出于义务而不得不做的事情，” 赫尔贝尼克博士说。

心理学家兼作家温迪·莫格尔(Wendy Mogel)说，一旦孩子在洗澡或换衣服时提出隐私要求，就答应他们。“这表达了一种尊重的概念，让孩子能够区分什么合适，什么不合适，并教会他们，他们的身体是独立的，由他们自己掌控，”她说。

帮助孩子听从自己的直觉并依其行事

“我们往往会向孩子强调礼仪，但在他们开始觉得不舒服的情况下，他们往往会觉得自己不可以表现得无礼或者离开，”莫格尔博士说。

因此，她建议和孩子玩角色扮演，假装是拿一窝小猫给孩子们看的邻居。“我会提醒他们，如果觉得情况不对，他们不用保持礼貌，甚至不用答话。他们可以尽管跑开并告诉可靠的成年人。”

角色扮演有助于给孩子提供一个应对令人尴尬对话的剧本，芬克霍尔博士说。“孩子可能会觉得‘我要回家’或‘你不能那样摸我’难以说出口，练习说这些强硬的话可以增加他们在需要的时候能够说出来的可能性。”

芬克霍尔博士还表示，有必要不仅和孩子讨论成为受害者的可能性，还要和他们讨论成为施害者的可能，因为人口调查发现，约一半的性侵犯的施予方是青少年。

家长还可以做的另一件事是向孩子保证，他们的感觉是正确的。“我们生活在一种男孩女孩都倾向于压抑对方感受的文化中，”《女孩领导力》(Girls Leadership)的联合创始人蕾切尔·西蒙斯(Rachel Simmons)说。“我们应该对他们说，‘我相信你的感觉，你也应该相信’，因为只有当你认可自己的感受时，才能维护自己的权益。”

让孩子知道你的支持

这一点很重要：告诉孩子，如果有人让她不舒服或碰了不该碰的地方，她是可以告诉你的，她不会因此有麻烦。侵犯者往往会跟孩子说，如果他们说出去，没人会相信他们，他们会被社会看不起、会受到责备，将放弃他们与侵犯者之间这种看似特殊的关系，美国印第安纳大学医学院赖利儿童医院(Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health)儿童性侵害诊所“希望儿科中心”(Pediatric Center of Hope)的塔拉·哈里斯(Tara Harris)博士说道。

告诉你的孩子，他们可以和你说，你不会评判或责怪他们，而是会尽你一切所能去保护他们。并且要做一次体检，这既是为了爱护孩子，也是为了记录证据。

对孩子来说，如果侵犯者是社会上受尊敬的人（如教师或教练）——这些似乎能掌控孩子未来的人，要报告侵害则尤其困难。

“这是父母发声的机会：我会和你站在一起——不论是什么成功，什么机会，都不值得用你现在所承受的侵犯去换取。”西蒙斯说道。

留意孩子的行为

“新闻推送的性质极度扭曲了父母眼中危险出现的概率。如果孩子身上没有植入GPS定位跟踪器，离开视线一秒，父母都会去想孩子今天是不是会被侵犯、骚扰或被绑架——这几乎不大可能，”莫格尔博士说。

然而，在合理范围内，孩子的生活需要得到密切关注。“我鼓励父母立下这个规定：晚上要把手机和电子设备放在父母房间，”哈里斯博士说。“孩子晚上应该睡觉，而不是玩手机；人们通常在晚上给孩子发不适当的内容。”监视夜间交流是预防可疑关系发展的一种方法。

如果你注意到孩子确有不适，请认真对待。“如果孩子突然比以往自闭，或一个人在房内独处的时间更多，请与他们谈谈，”赫本尼克博士说。“让他们知道，‘我注意到你的问题了，我想确保你没事’。”

(FT)Each weekday, DealBook reporters in New York and London offer commentary and analysis on the day’s most important business news.","Remember that the VIX tracks investor expectations of how volatile stock markets will be in the month ahead. The possibility that Mr. Flynn could implicate senior White House officials in Mr. Mueller’s investigation would certainly throw the markets into high uncertainty.

Major stock indexes have pulled back today as well, despite the tax news. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down nearly 1 percent at 2,622.12, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down a more modest 0.6 percent, at 24,120.72.

More potential holdouts back the Senate tax plan.

Two Republican senators who had previously opposed the bill for its treatment of so-called pass-through businesses, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, now say they will vote for the legislation.

What convinced them? Tweaks to how pass-through businesses are treated:

The Senate tax bill allows pass-through owners to deduct 17.4 percent of their business income as a way of lowering their taxes. Republicans were planning to increase the deduction to 20 percent to address the concerns over how pass-through owners were being treated by the bill. Now, the deduction is to be raised to 23 percent, an aide to Mr. Daines said.

The remaining holdouts include Susan Collins of Maine and several senators concerned about the bill’s effect on the deficit.

The issues that still need to be addressed in the Senate bill.

Senators are still expected to vote today on the proposal. But its chances of succeeding may come down to whether deficit hawks in the Senate like Bob Corker of Tennessee can be convinced that the overhaul will not add to the national deficit. Last night, lawmakers were pushed to remove a provision that would have automatically raised tax rates if economic growth did not prove strong enough to pay for cuts.

That’s on top of other bad news for Senate Republicans, including the Joint Committee on Taxation finding that the bill would add $1 trillion to the deficit, though G.O.P. officials largely dismissed that conclusion. Here’s a handy breakdown of various analyses of the bill’s potential effect on the deficit.

How Republican leaders are proposing to find at least $400 billion in new revenue

• Slowly raising corporate rates above 20 percent

• Huge automatic cuts to government programs, from Medicare to farm subsidies to student loans

The big problem

According to Caitlin Owens of Axios:

Aides say they still hope to bring all 52 Republicans to yes. But it’s going to be extremely hard to find ways to raise as much as $500 billion in revenue overnight, and raising taxes could lose other members.

No chief executive wants to see this…

Shares of Blue Apron are up nearly 10% Friday. The bump in share price comes after the meal-kit maker said late Thursday that co-founder Matt Salzberg is stepping down as chief executive and is being replaced with chief financial officer Brad Dickerson.

Shares of Blue Apron have stumbled since its initial public offering in June. The company’s stock is down 70 percent from its I.P.O. price. That is the worst performance of any U.S.-listed I.P.O. this year.

Shares of companies that have gone public this year on exchanges in the United States have gained, on average, 24 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. Shares of tech companies that have debuted in the United States this year are up 17 percent so far.

Robert Mercer has financial ties to Project Veritas.

A family investment vehicle tied to the billionaire helped finance Project Veritas, a conservative activist organization, according to tax filings obtained by BuzzFeed.

From the article:

Gravitas Maximus LLC — a Mercer investment vehicle through which he also funded the conservative outlet Breitbart — gave $25,000 to Project Veritas, according to a nonpublic portion of a 2012 tax form. The family’s involvement has not previously been made public.

Project Veritas popped up in the news this week when the WaPo reported that the organization tried to convince some of its reporters to write about false claims involving the Alabama Republican senate candidate Roy Moore.

Mr. Mercer stepped down in November as co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies amid signs of unease among the firm’s clients over his embrace of polarizing political figures.

He has tried to distance himself from Breitbart’s executive chairman, Steve Bannon, by selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters. But people with knowledge of his thinking previously told the NYT that that he was likely to accelerate his political donations.

A key figure from ‘Barbarians at the Gate’ is taking a step back.

Peter Cohen, a longtime financier, will step down as the financial firm’s C.E.O. He will remain chairman, but leading the firm on a day-to-day basis will be Jeffrey Solomon.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Cohen has had a long career in banking, one whose highlights include a starring role in the famed fight over RJR Nabisco. It was Mr. Cohen — then the head of Shearson Lehman Hutton — who, along with his colleague Tom Hill, provided the financial backing for F. Ross Johnson’s attempted leveraged buyout of the company. Of course, he and Mr. Johnson were eventually defeated by KKR.

The banker later founded Ramius Capital, a hedge fund, in 1994 and later merged it with the much older Cowen in 2009 to become a firm whose offerings run from investment banking to asset management.

Mr. Cohen said in a statement:

“The new year will mark my 50th anniversary in the industry and will also be Cowen’s 100th year anniversary. We have transformed Cowen over the last eight years, through a series of acquisitions and organic initiatives, into an organization that has a solid foundation with tremendous growth opportunities.”

Are stock investors still confident on a tax overhaul?

The Dow Jones industrial average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday, largely on increased optimism that the Senate would pass its tax bill. The Dow has had 63 record closes this year, and it has crossed five one-thousand-point markers this year, the most ever.

But today is a new day. Futures in both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 were down in premarket trading.

Why investors shouldn’t be so optimistic on taxes: Lower corporate tax bills might not bolster the earnings of big companies that much. “The effective tax rate among S.&P. 500 companies is already 26 percent. A 20 percent corporate tax rate would help, but it would not be as big a boon to large companies as it would be to small companies,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, told CNBC.

If the Senate tax bill fails …

“If the tax reform doesn’t get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction,” said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.

Mr. Van Saun told the NYT that stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut were to be derailed in Congress.

The pessimistic line on the market: “All good things must come to an end,” strategists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a recent note, according to Bloomberg.

Shervin Pishevar is the latest tech star to face misconduct claims.

Mr. Pishevar, an outspoken venture capitalist who was an early backer of digital darlings like Uber and Airbnb and is a major donor to Democratic politicians, is accused of repeatedly assaulting or harassing women. Five women spoke with Bloomberg about what they said were incidents of him forcibly kissing, groping or otherwise harassing them.

And it had been previously reported that he had been arrested in London earlier this year after being accused of assaulting a woman, though he was released by police.

In a statement, Mr. Pishevar denied the claims and said he was the victim of “an organized smear campaign.”

The context: Three other prominent investors — Steve Jurvetson, Justin Caldbeck and Dave McClure — have left or been forced out of their firms following accusations of sexual misconduct.

The health care deal that Wall Street has been waiting for is near.

CVS is closing in on an agreement to buy Aetna for more than $66 billion, in which it would pay at least $200 per Aetna share, according to the WSJ. (Michael has heard the same thing.) A transaction could come as soon as Monday.

Shares in CVS rose on the news, but those in Aetna hadn’t risen much. The research analyst Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners told Bloomberg that Aetna shareholders may be worried about how much of the offer would be in CVS stock, given the complexity of putting together a big pharmacy chain and a health insurance provider — in other words, two relatively dissimilar businesses.

While the White House works to get closer to Saudi Arabia …

The Economist takes a close look at the civil war in Yemen, which the magazine calls “the worst humanitarian crisis in the world,” and the kingdom’s role in it:

As a result, Yemenis have become the pawns in the regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Alarmed by Iran’s spreading influence, the Saudis have begun to speak of the Houthis rather as Israelis refer to the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah: a dangerous Iranian proxy army on their border.

It’s another critical look at Saudi Arabia, which has been courting the international business community while also shocking business leaders with its mass detention of royals, including the businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

Kirkland Poaches Lawyers From Debevoise

An exclusive from our NYT colleague David Gelles:

Erica Berthou and Jordan Murray, two senior investment fund lawyers, are jumping to Kirkland & Ellis from Debevoise & Plimpton. Both will be partners in Kirkland’s Investment Funds Group.

At Debevoise, Ms. Berthou was leader of the firm’s global investment management and funds group, and Mr. Murray was deputy chair of the global corporate department.

“Their experience and talent will be a major benefit to our many private equity sponsor clients and will significantly enhance our global platform, which aims to provide full coverage throughout the life cycle of a fund,” John O’Neil, global head of Kirkland’s investment funds group, said in an internal memo that will go out this morning.

“He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election.
By “happenstance” and the reach of the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson wrote, he had been put in position to “slowly begin cultivating a back-channel to President Putin’s Kremlin” in recent years.
Ms. Butina, who helped Mr. Torshin make the request through Mr. Clay, hosted Mr. Erickson at a September 2014 meeting of the group at its Moscow office.
According to Mr. Clay, neither Mr. Trump nor his campaign officials attended the veterans’ dinner.","“Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” the N.R.A. member and conservative activist, Paul Erickson, wrote. “He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election. Let’s talk through what has transpired and Senator Sessions’s advice on how to proceed.”

It is not clear how Mr. Dearborn handled the outreach. He forwarded a similar proposal, made through Rick Clay, an advocate for conservative Christian causes, to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a top campaign aide. Mr. Kushner rebuffed the proposal at the time, according to two people who have seen Mr. Kushner’s email.

Mr. Sessions told investigators from the House Intelligence Committee that he did not recall the outreach, according to three people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Dearborn did not return requests for comment, and Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with matters related to the investigations, declined to comment. Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Erickson were not successful.

Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia, on orders from the highest levels of its government, undertook a sophisticated campaign to hack Democratic computers, spread propaganda and undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. The repeated outreach around the N.R.A. convention, where Mr. Trump accepted the group’s endorsement, came just weeks after a self-described intermediary for the Russian government told George Papadopoulos, a campaign aide, that the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. And just weeks later, the president’s eldest son arranged a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the would-be Democratic nominee.

“The Kremlin believes that the only possibility of a true reset in this relationship would be with a new Republican White House,” Mr. Erickson wrote to Mr. Dearborn, adding, “Ever since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.”

Congressional investigators obtained the email as part of their inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether Mr. Trump’s campaign aided the efforts. It appears to have caught the attention of senators as well. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, penned letters to several Trump campaign foreign policy advisers last week asking for all documents related to the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson, Mr. Torshin, Mr. Clay, Mr. Dearborn and others.

Mr. Erickson, a longtime conservative operative who has been involved in several presidential campaigns, presented himself in the email as a well-connected intermediary to the upper reaches of the Russian government. By “happenstance” and the reach of the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson wrote, he had been put in position to “slowly begin cultivating a back-channel to President Putin’s Kremlin” in recent years.

“Russia is quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S. that isn’t forthcoming under the current administration,” he wrote.

Indeed, evidence does appear to show deep ties between Mr. Erickson, the N.R.A. and the Russian gun rights community that were formed in the years when many American conservatives, put off by the Obama administration’s policies, were increasingly looking to Mr. Putin as an example of a strong leader opposing immigration, terrorism and gay rights.

The N.R.A. was one of Mr. Trump’s biggest backers during the campaign, spending tens of millions of dollars to help elect him.

Mr. Erickson has known Maria Butina, a former assistant to Mr. Torshin and the founder of the Right to Bear Arms, a Russian gun-rights group, for several years. Ms. Butina, who helped Mr. Torshin make the request through Mr. Clay, hosted Mr. Erickson at a September 2014 meeting of the group at its Moscow office. And in February 2016, the two incorporated a company, Bridges LLC, together in South Dakota. What the company does is unclear.

In December 2015, Mr. Erickson returned to Russia as part of an N.R.A. delegation that included David Keene, the group’s onetime president, top donors and David A. Clarke Jr., the former sheriff of Milwaukee County who became a popular Trump campaign surrogate. At one stop, the group met with Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister in charge of defense. A photograph from the meeting shows Mr. Torshin was also present.

In the United States, the hospitality was returned. Mr. Torshin and Ms. Butina attended the N.R.A.’s annual convention in 2014 and 2015. Ms. Butina told the conservative news site Townhall that she attended the N.R.A. Women’s Leadership Luncheon as a guest of Sandra S. Froman, a former president of the group. And in 2015, she was given a tour of the N.R.A.’s Virginia headquarters.

Attempts to contact Ms. Butina were unsuccessful.

Mr. Erickson does not explicitly name Mr. Torshin in the email to Mr. Dearborn, but the message appears to refer to him, the people familiar with the communication said. Instead, he describes “President Putin’s emissary on this front,” whose plans match those of Mr. Torshin.

Mr. Torshin, he wrote, was planning to attend a reception being planned by Mr. Clay honoring wounded veterans that he expected Mr. Trump would also attend. Mr. Torshin expected to use the reception to “make ‘first contact’” with the candidate and present Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, with a gift from the Russian Orthodox Church.

According to Mr. Clay, neither Mr. Trump nor his campaign officials attended the veterans’ dinner. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Mr. Torshin did attend a separate N.R.A. dinner that night.

Mr. Torshin served in the upper house of the Russian Parliament and was a member of the country’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a government body that includes the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs and the director of the Federal Security Service, known as F.S.B., the K.G.B.’s successor. He has been a leading advocate of gun rights in Russia and of more closely linking the government and the Russian Orthodox Church.

Spanish investigators say that while he was in Parliament, Mr. Torshin laundered money for the Russian mafia through Spanish banks and properties. Mr. Torshin has denied those accusations.",Operative Offered Trump Campaign ‘Kremlin Connection’ Using N.R.A. Ties,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-nra-campaign.html

“I say this just very objectively: I thought the question was patently unfair,” Hannity told me.","In 1989, now living in Santa Barbara, Calif., Hannity began calling in to the local talk station, KTMS, to argue the merits of the Reaganite worldview he’d absorbed from Grant and others. That fall, he applied for an unpaid position at KCSB, the radio station of the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a host, Hannity was quick to test boundaries, to jab at what he regarded as the liberal pieties of the student body. After just a few months on the air, he invited onto his program a Lutheran minister named Gene Antonio, who contended that the government was hiding the truth about the AIDS crisis. “First of all, the rectum is designed to expel feces, not take in a penis, and so what happens is the body rebels against that,” Antonio told Hannity, explaining his theory of why gay men were prone to various diseases.

In a later broadcast, Hannity took a call from Jody May-Chang, the host of a KCSB show called “Gay and Lesbian Perspectives.” Hannity asked if it was true that May-Chang had a child with another woman. It was, May-Chang said. Hannity shot back that he felt sorry for the kid. “I think anyone that believes, anyone listening to this show that believes homosexuality is just a normal lifestyle has been brainwashed,” Hannity concluded.

Richard Flacks, then the station’s faculty adviser, says that “it was this specific moment when he deals with Jody that was something more than repulsive speech.” After the studio took the young host off the air, Hannity contacted a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union and successfully petitioned the university for a second chance. Then, in an act of characteristic bravado, he called for a public apology and an extra hour on the air every day. He was turned down.

Hannity told me his removal was “deserved”; in retrospect, he said, his statements were “ignorant and embarrassing.” His views on same-sex marriage, he stressed, were now “libertarian,” and he has gay friends. But it was the start of a pattern that would repeat throughout his radio and TV career: Poke, prod, provoke, step back and do it all over again. Bill Dunnavant, Hannity’s boss at his first professional radio gig, in Huntsville, Ala., recalled turning on the radio one afternoon and hearing Hannity engaging in a contentious live interview with the madam of a Nevada brothel. Dunnavant told me he pulled over at the nearest pay phone. “Don’t you ever do that again!” he shouted at Hannity. “This is a family station.”

Hannity told me, “You know, the only way to be successful — it took me a little while to figure it out — is you’ve got to be yourself on the radio.” His ratings slowly improved, and in 1992, he accepted a job at WGST in Atlanta, one of the largest markets in the south. At WGST, he alternated condemnation of the White House-bound Bill Clinton, an early Hannity bête noire, with lighter fare, like a one-off April Fools’ Day segment in which he prodded young callers to vow not to engage in premarital sex. He also began periodically traveling to New York to appear as a political commentator on daytime programs hosted by Phil Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael. The segments were short, but the camera liked Hannity’s blocky features and his forceful delivery.

In 1996, Hannity’s agent, David Limbaugh, got word of a new cable network being funded by the Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Limbaugh had an inside line — the network’s head, Roger Ailes, had helped start his brother Rush’s television show. He suggested Hannity apply.

A few hours later, Hannity was in Ailes’s office in New York. Their conversation was short and straightforward: “Roger goes, ‘Great, you’re going to do a debate show,’ ” Hannity remembers. “And that’s all it took. My life changed forever.”

Hannity’s program was given the all-important 9 p.m. slot at Fox News, but through the summer of 1996, as the network edged closer to its debut, the show still had no co-host. Ailes brought in a range of options, including Joe Conason, a seasoned investigative reporter who was then the executive editor of and a liberal columnist for The New York Observer. Conason did a screen test but was never asked back; eventually, the job went to the mild-mannered Alan Colmes. (Colmes died in February of lymphoma.) “I came to the conclusion that Roger wanted a handsome, smart conservative on one side and a nerdy liberal on the other,” says Patrick Halpin, a commentator and frequent guest on “Hannity & Colmes.” “Alan, God rest his soul, was smart and knowledgeable, but he wasn’t Joe, who would’ve been too strong for Hannity.”

For his producer, Hannity proposed Bill Shine, whom he met while subbing in as a host on a short-lived cable network called NewsTalk Television. “The worst thing you can do to Sean Hannity,” Shine told me, “is remind him of his first day.” Hannity was stiff and “petrified,” in his own recollection, prone to tensing up in front of the camera. At one point, Hannity and Shine ran into each other in a parking garage on 48th Street, near the Fox headquarters. Shine asked Hannity if he thought the show would last five years. “Five years would be great,” Hannity said.

In 1997, Hannity took a nighttime radio slot at WABC — the show went into national syndication the day before the 9/11 attacks — and learned to use the radio program as a workshop for television. On WABC, he could afford to float new ideas, test new lines of attack. By the next day, in time for the start of “Hannity & Colmes,” the material had been sharpened and refined into talking points he could fire at his Fox audience. It was in this manner — percussively, repeatedly — that he helped bolster the case for an invasion of Iraq and chipped away at Republican support for a bipartisan 2007 path-to-citizenship bill that later perished in the United States Senate.

When Colmes left “Hannity & Colmes” in 2009, the program was rebranded as just “Hannity,” and dressed up in American-flag-inspired graphics. Hannity credits Ailes for sticking with him long enough to see him prosper on television. The Fox C.E.O., Hannity told me, “was a father figure,” and in 2016, Hannity vociferously defended his boss in the face of sexual-harassment allegations. (With Hannity, as with Trump, loyalty is paramount, and although he and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly have not always gotten along, “Hannity” was O’Reilly’s first stop at the network after being fired from Fox this year in response to allegations of sexual harassment.)

“Sean definitely led the ‘Come on, guys, we can’t let our boss go down’ group,” Geraldo Rivera told me. “But Sean is also the one who ultimately said to me, ‘From what I’ve seen and heard, some of the allegations are true.’ ” Hannity told me of Ailes: “You know, sometimes people are complicated in life, sometimes it’s not black and white. Some of the most brilliant people I have met in my life — something I don’t have to worry about; I consider myself pretty average — the most brilliant people, often their blessing can be their curse. Do I believe everything that was said? No. Do I think maybe some of it is true? Maybe.” He added, “But if you assume for a second some of it was true, that’s a side of him I never knew, never saw.”

As a broadcaster, Hannity has thrived as a champion of insurrection. In the early 1990s, he rose to regional prominence as a staunch backer of Gingrich’s crusade to wrest control of Congress from the Democrats; after joining WABC in 1997, he rode the Monica Lewinsky scandal to the top of the New York talk-radio charts. And in 2009, he threw his support behind the Tea Party, a movement that inspired his early support for Trump. He became cable TV’s most ardent booster of the movement, giving ample airtime to various Tea Party figures and broadcasting his television and radio programs from a Tea Party rally in downtown Atlanta. “It was exciting,” Hannity recalls. “There was so much energy, and they were talking about all the [expletive] I’d been talking about for years: Small government, lower taxes.”

Hannity’s overt backing of the Tea Party was not unique at Fox News. But he wasn’t just backing the movement on air: He was also participating in fund-raising activities and allowing his image to be attached to promotional mailers for groups like the Tea Party Patriots, which was also an advertiser on his radio show. And occasionally he pushed into fringier terrain, as when in 2011 he aired a television interview with Trump, then toying with running for president the following year, during Trump’s crusade to force President Obama to release his birth certificate. Obama, Trump said, “could have easily have come from Kenya, or someplace.”

“The issue could go away in a minute,” Hannity interjected. “Just show the certificate.”

At least publicly, Ailes did not always seem comfortable with Hannity’s association with the Tea Party, and in 2010, he forbade Hannity to tape his Fox show from the stage of a Tea Party fund-raiser in Ohio. (Hannity says he was unaware that the group had charged for tickets.) But according to a source at Fox News, Ailes’s private reaction was considerably more measured: “Look, Roger was smart — he knew how much money was being generated by the opinion-side guys versus the news-side guys.” Hannity was called into Ailes’s office and sent on his way with a promise not to involve the show in any future fund-raising gigs.

The success of the Tea Party movement, Hannity told me recently, made him certain that if Obama-era Democratic rule were going to be toppled, it would not be with more establishment Republican politics. In 2015, after observing Mitt Romney’s sound thumping in the previous presidential election, he decided to fly around the country to secure the first interview with Republican contenders, preferably immediately after each one announced. He chartered flights himself, spending almost a million dollars in travel expenses. He saw it as “an investment in the business.”

“I’d take friends, my staff, whatever,” he told me. “I’d always fill the seats.” He gravitated early to the Tea Party favorite, Ted Cruz. “But then I’d go to a Trump rally,” he told me. “You only had to open your eyes and see the enthusiasm.”

Among Hannity’s critics, his relationship with Trump is frequently depicted as nakedly and sycophantically transactional — one career entertainer grabbing onto the coattails of another and hanging on for dear life. But people close to the president and Hannity say this caricature vastly oversimplifies the complicated and evolving alliance between the two men and misunderstands the degree to which Trump, as candidate and president, has come to Hannity’s positions, rather than the other way around.

“A big part of how Trump gauges how things are going is how they play out on television in particular,” a Trump campaign official told me. And long before he began his presidential bid in the lobby of Trump Tower in June 2015, Trump was a frequent viewer of “Hannity.” “From that first trip down the escalator at Trump Tower,” the official went on, “Trump was able to literally speak like he was on ‘Hannity.’ ”

As the primaries gave way to the general election, Hannity and Trump’s campaign staff were in touch on an almost-daily basis. “Occasionally, we’d talk on Sean’s show knowing Trump was watching,” Gingrich told me. “The two most effective ways of communicating with Trump are ‘Fox & Friends’ and ‘Hannity.’ ”

John Gomez, Hannity’s old friend, who traveled with him on several legs of his Republican primary tour, recalled that Hannity saw something of himself in the president. “Sean knows that there’s nothing better in radio than that shocking moment, that moment that freezes you,” Gomez told me. Trump did what other politicians wouldn’t. “They’re afraid to state a controversial point. That bugs Sean.”

Bill Shine told me that when it came to the opinion side of the Fox News operation, Hannity was “early on, pretty [much] first” when it came to vocal support of Trump. This put the host at odds with a sizable portion of the Fox News brass, along with Rupert Murdoch, who, according to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, had advised Ailes to “tilt to anyone but Trump,” even if that anyone was Hillary Clinton. The vehemently anti-Clinton Hannity was not about to let that happen. (Ailes, after leaving Fox News, later joined the Trump campaign as a debate adviser.)

Hannity spoke directly to Trump during the campaign. “I was a little bit of a liaison,” he says, between the Trump camp and Fox News. In August 2015, Hannity’s colleague Megyn Kelly asked Trump at a Fox News-sponsored debate to account for his derogatory comments about women. “I say this just very objectively: I thought the question was patently unfair,” Hannity told me. In “Devil’s Bargain,” his book on Bannon and Trump, the Bloomberg Businessweek correspondent Joshua Green writes that Trump phoned Hannity the weekend after the debate, threatening to boycott Fox. Shortly thereafter, he tweeted: “Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy & assures me that ‘Trump’ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews.”

Kelly has since decamped to NBC, but the fissures exposed during the 2016 campaign have widened. “Back in the day, Roger had this saying: ‘You don’t piss inside the tent,’ ” a longtime Fox employee told me. But since Ailes’s death, in May, news-side stars have sniped publicly at hosts like Hannity. In November, Shepard Smith used his afternoon show to throw cold water on the theory — one given extensive airtime by Hannity — that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, orchestrated a sale of uranium to Russia in exchange for a donation to the Clinton Foundation. (Through a spokeswoman, Smith denied he’d been referring to Hannity, and said he and Hannity “respected one another’s roles at the channel.”) And Chris Wallace, the veteran anchor, recently complained, in comments widely seen as directed at Hannity, about some of his colleagues’ propensity for attacking the rest of the media. “Bad form,” Wallace told The Associated Press.

The problem for Fox News is that while Hannity has risen to become the top ratings-earner of the nightly lineup, he is also a figure prone to barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism. And Fox executives frequently have been forced to juggle advertiser discontent with the need to ensure that Hannity, does not leave for a rival network, like Sinclair Broadcast Group, a right-leaning owner of local TV stations.

In November, Alvin Chang, a writer for Vox, crunched data from two years of Hannity TV transcripts and concluded that Hannity was, in his mentions of topics like “the deep state” and the uranium deal, the media’s “top conspiracy theorist.” In our conversations, Hannity rejected the label, calling it a “typical left-wing attack. My whole career I’ve pursued the truth and have been proven right time after time while my colleagues are often dead wrong.” And to watch Hannity regularly is to observe how distant the host is from a figure like the Infowars proprietor Alex Jones. Jones endorses theories; Hannity almost never does, leaving that job to his guests. It is a dance that has the effect of nourishing the more wild-eyed beliefs of his fans while providing Hannity a degree of plausible deniability.

This approach was on full display during the 2016 election, when Hannity invited a doctor to analyze Hillary Clinton’s health on the basis of video footage. (“That looks like violent, out of control movements on her part,” Hannity suggested hopefully.) And it was most infamously evident in his coverage of the case of Seth Rich, a young staff member at the Democratic National Committee murdered in July 2016, in what Washington police say was a street robbery gone bad. But others, like the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, soon began suggesting that Rich had been killed in retaliation for the leaking of sensitive internal D.N.C. emails. This February, a prominent Trump supporter, Ed Butowsky, offered to bankroll a former Washington homicide detective and Fox News contributor named Rod Wheeler to look into the case; according to court documents in a continuing federal lawsuit brought by Wheeler, he and Butowsky later met with Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary, and briefed him on the story.

For Hannity, Wheeler’s investigation did double duty as drama and political cudgel: If Rich was involved in the leaks, then the contention that Russia had undertaken the hack on behalf of Trump would be discredited. And on May 16, he invited Wheeler onto “Hannity.” “Is there any evidence,” Hannity asked, that Rich “might have been disgruntled by the treatment of Bernie Sanders and the unfairness, and that the fix was in, to put Hillary in that position” as the Democratic presidential candidate, “and maybe had evidence of that?” Wheeler demurred, but said that his investigation had uncovered proof that Rich was “having problems” at the D.N.C. “So connect the dots here,” Wheeler suggested. (In his lawsuit, Wheeler claims that the Trump administration and Fox News conspired to push the Rich story on air. Butowsky denies many allegations within the lawsuit and has filed a motion to have it dismissed.)

After Rich’s family demanded an apology and a retraction from Fox News, Hannity stopped mentioning Rich on the air, and he declined to discuss the case directly with me. But he has also tweeted that he is still looking into the circumstances of Rich’s death: “Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever. Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder. Updates when available.” He visited Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, and he told me that he has continued to exchange messages with Kim Dotcom, a New Zealand-based fugitive internet entrepreneur and another proponent of the Rich-as-D.N.C.-leaker story. “There is a much deeper story yet to be heard,” he said.

Hannity’s intransigence is Trumpian in its effectiveness: By backing off on reporting on Fox News about Rich, but maintaining his contention that there “is something going on,” he is effectively having it both ways. At least until a killer is found, he will never have to admit he is wrong. And Trump will continue to be the beneficiary.

One Sunday evening this fall, Hannity sat in the back room of Chris & Tony’s, an Italian restaurant in a strip mall off Jericho Turnpike, in Syosset, a Long Island town. Hannity visits Chris & Tony’s regularly, and he ordered without looking at the menu — baked clams, Kobe beef meatballs, a cheese-covered dish he informed me was known as Heroin Chicken. He poked at the meat hesitantly. At 55, Hannity is increasingly worried about his weight; he recently switched to light beer, and he has upped the frequency of his workouts with his martial-arts trainer, Glenn Rubin.

“We have days we call ‘keeping it real,’ ” he said. “And keeping it real is like this guy who’s so big and so strong, and he’s coming up to me all throughout an hour-and-15-minute session and putting me in chokeholds, seeing how I respond to a gun to my head. You know, how do I deal with blades? And then another day is pain day, and then literally you put out your arms, ‘Boom, boom, boom.’ ” He mimed a hammer-punching motion against his forearm and stomach. “It’s made me stronger than I’ve ever been in my life.”

A waiter appeared with two more pints of beer. When he left, Hannity gestured toward him. “I’m no different to all the service businesses,” he said. It was a theme he returned to frequently, his enduring fixation on consumer demand — what made people angry or happy, what turned them on or off. Hannity, who was recently inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, told me he continues to pay for his own focus-group surveys of his radio and television shows: What he seems to fear more than anything else is the prospect of a fan picking up the remote.

For now, he has little to worry about. During the Moore scandal, he ascended to the top of the cable-news ratings heap. In the weeks after our first meeting, I kept in close touch with Hannity by text. As John Gomez, Hannity’s longtime friend, had warned me, Hannity appears to be constitutionally unable not to answer his phone, and the messages often arrived at night — “asleep at 11 p.m.?” read one chiding text — or even on commercial breaks from his television show.

Sometimes, Hannity would preview segments to me, offering the broad arguments that he would refine and repeat that night. “Remember trump lost VA and NJ. No shock,” he texted after Republican losses in races for governor in those states; that night on the air, he repeated the words almost verbatim. “Massive boomerang coming back on Dems on Russia,” he texted before a segment on the purported uranium deal; a few days later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s office announced it would consider appointing a special counsel to look into the supposed deal. The influence obviously thrilled him, as did the reactions it could provoke. “I say it,” he texted, “and it’s gone. Then liberals bubble and fizz and give off steam like Alka-Seltzer in water.”

In October, Hannity flew to Middletown, Pa., to interview Trump in advance of a rally to gin up support for tax reform. Sitting inches from the president, Hannity covered the biggest issues of the day, serving as rudder and prompt — steering Trump gently to friendly terrain. The new tax cuts, Trump said, would be “massive”; working-class Pennsylvanians were “incredible”; health care reform would be “great”; and Democratic policies were “terrible,” an adjective the president went on to apply to Colin Kaepernick, the education system and the urban crime rate.

Hannity, smiling solicitously throughout, let the roar of the crowd stand in for his response.

“I will say this,” Trump told his friend, before leaving the stage. “You have been so great. And I’m very proud of you.”",How Far Will Sean Hannity Go?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/how-far-will-sean-hannity-go.html

Last week, I watched our president interrupt a White House ceremony honoring the Navajo code talkers to degrade Senator Elizabeth Warren by referring to her as Pocahontas. In front of a painting of the signer of the Indian Removal Act himself, Andrew Jackson. Weeks deep into Native American Heritage month. It was like the worst game of Clue. The president disrespecting my elders, in the cellarium, with the tiki torch. I felt rage. More than usual, which is crazy, because since the election I pretty much use a steady supply of mozzarella sticks to soften my constant fury.

Since that ceremony, more than the disbelief — because of course he would do that — one thought keeps coming back to me. It is the root of my frustration: Donald Trump would make a terrible Navajo. Now, I know what you’re thinking, “We don’t know that. Forty-five might make a terrific Navajo.” Well, hear me out.

First, Navajos serve in the military. Not me, but a lot of us do. Native Americans enlist in the military at a higher per capita rate than any other racial demographic. Many of the code talkers even doctored their birth certificates so they could join early.

Navajos respect women. Precontact, my tribe was matrilineal. Women owned all the property and ran everything. Historically speaking, we were also cool with trans people and immigrants.

Navajos actually close deals. You think Donald Trump could sell a $300 hand drum to a nice woman from Minnesota whose husband is trying to drag her away? Because I did that when I was 9.

We can handle being hated. Not just by white people which, hoo boy, there’s definitely that, but also by other Natives. We’re one of the largest of the 500-plus federally recognized tribes in the United States. We’re basically Regina George from “Mean Girls.” Get a group of Natives together and I guarantee they will bond by complaining about Navajos. And we don’t care, because people with real power don’t care what others think of them.

Navajos are funnier than the president. Like legitimately funny. Because we’re biting, which is a polite way of saying we’re mean. Personally, I love Senator Warren and can’t wait for her to be president, but I or any random Navajo could have come up with better burns for her than Mr. Trump did: “Elizabeth Snorin’ ”; “Human PowerPoint”; “Government Drone.”

And this is probably a small thing, but Navajos don’t, say, direct people to meet with Russian ambassadors as a means to potentially undermine our democracy.

I just really don’t think he has what it takes, for all of those reasons, but mostly because many Navajos, the code talkers specifically, truly love this country, despite everything it’s done to try to erase us from it. And in three years who knows where the president will be, but I know those proud Marine veterans will still be representing their land and its people. They inspire us to remember that in the recesses of our discouraging past, there are still flashes of grace, dignity and bravery. I hold onto that notion every day.

Three months ago, The Washington Post reported that even as Donald Trump ran for president, he pursued plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The next day, The New York Times published excerpts from emails between Felix Sater, a felon with ties to Russian organized crime, and Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump’s lawyers and Sater’s childhood friend, about the project. Sater was apparently an intermediary between Trump and Russia, and in a Nov. 3, 2015, email to Cohen, he made the strange argument that a successful deal would lead to Trump’s becoming president. Boasting that he was close enough to Vladimir Putin to let Ivanka Trump sit in the Russian president’s desk chair, Sater wrote, “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.”

These stories were, at the time, bombshells. At a minimum, they showed that Trump was lying when he said, repeatedly, that he had “nothing to do with Russia.” Further, Sater’s logic — that Putin’s buy-in on a real estate deal would result in Trump’s election — was bizarre, suggesting that some part of the proposed collaboration was left unsaid.

But three months feels like three decades in Trump years, and I mostly forgot about these reports until I read Luke Harding’s new book, “Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.” One uncanny aspect of the investigations into Trump’s Russia connections is that instead of too little evidence there’s too much. It’s impossible to keep it straight without the kind of chaotic wall charts that Carrie Mathison of “Homeland” assembled during her manic episodes. Incidents that would be major scandals in a normal administration — like the mere fact of Trump’s connection to Sater — become minor subplots in this one.

That’s why “Collusion” is so essential, and why I wish everyone who is skeptical that Russia has leverage over Trump would read it. This country — at least the parts not wholly under the sway of right-wing propaganda — needs to come to terms with substantial evidence that the president is in thrall to a foreign power.

Harding, the former Moscow bureau chief of The Guardian, has been reporting on shady characters like Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was indicted last month, long before Trump announced his candidacy. He was able to interview Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier attempting to detail Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin, and who describes the conspiracy between the American president and the Russians as “massive — absolutely massive.”

“Collusion” doesn’t purport to solve all the mysteries of this alleged conspiracy. There’s no longer any serious question that there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but the extent of the cooperation, and the precise nature of it, remains opaque. Harding makes a strong case for Steele’s credibility, but Steele reportedly said that the raw intelligence in his dossier is only 70 percent to 90 percent accurate, so it’s hard to know which parts of it to believe.","Odds Are, Russia Owns Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/opinion/trump-patriot-russia.html

It waited almost 10 hours to release the first results, which showed Mr. Nasralla ahead by five percentage points with 58 percent of the polling places counted.

But the count then stalled until Tuesday afternoon and after it resumed, Mr. Hernández steadily closed the gap and eventually overtook Mr. Nasralla. The shift led to allegations that the commission was counting only those polling places where Mr. Hernández had won, and was setting aside for special review the tally sheets from areas where he had lost.

The commission agreed to count the remaining tally sheets under pressure from international observers. In a sign of how widespread distrust of the electoral commission has become, Honduras’s conservative main business group joined the call for a full count.

“At the end, there is a lack of confidence in the commission from all sectors,” said Rodolfo Pastor, a strategist for the left-wing Alliance Against the Dictatorship, Mr. Nasralla’s coalition. “The perception that there was manipulation has been created.”

The opposition has asked the electoral commission to disclose vote databases, and it demanded a recount in three departments where turnout was said to be about 20 percentage points higher than the average elsewhere in the country.

Unless those demands are met, the opposition alliance said, it would not take part in the last stage of the count. “That would endorse fraud,” Mr. Pastor wrote in a text message.

Protesters blocked roads and bridges for a second day on Friday to demand an impartial count. In some places they burned tires, filling the air with thick, black smoke. There was some looting, and security forces clashed with protesters in several places, leading to injuries.

Opposition supporters charged that the violent protesters and looters were infiltrators, deployed to give the government an excuse to use the security forces. Vice President Ricardo Alvarez acknowledged that many of the looters were people “taking advantage of the situation,” not supporters of the opposition.

The political turmoil adds to the problems facing Honduras, where two-thirds of the population lives in poverty. Street gangs and drug traffickers operate freely in parts of the country, and despite a fall in the homicide rate, Honduras is still one of the deadliest countries in the world outside a war zone.

Corruption is endemic: Hondurans marched in the streets for weeks in 2015 to protest the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from the main public health system. High-ranking police officers linked to the assassination of two antidrug officials were removed but have not been investigated.

The postelection unrest also highlights the intense polarization in Honduras, a political divide that burst to the surface in 2009, when President Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a coup.

Mr. Zelaya’s move to the left, including a growing closeness to Venezuela, had alarmed the country’s political and business elites. At the time, however, they justified the coup by arguing that Mr. Zelaya had been seeking to get around a constitutional ban on re-election.

“There’s an institutional weakness and a matter of political culture,” said Dan Restrepo, who was an adviser on Latin America at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. “I think the coup was a symptom rather than a cause of it.”

“There’s hasn’t been political and national reconciliation within the Honduran political classes,” he added. “We’re seeing another manifestation of that now.”

Protests against Mr. Zelaya’s ouster persisted for months, and he ultimately formed Libre, the main party behind the alliance that is supporting Mr. Nasralla.

Ultimately it was Mr. Hernández, not Mr. Zelaya, who found a way to lift the ban on re-election. Two years ago, five Supreme Court judges, handpicked by Mr. Hernández, ruled that the prohibition was unconstitutional.

Mr. Hernández had been widely expected to win a second term. His iron-fist policies against crime gave many people a sense that security was improving, and his social programs handed out benefits to the poor.

His allies in the media assured favorable coverage during the election campaign, and despite campaign finance restrictions, his ads accounted for almost two-thirds of all campaign publicity, according to a report released this week by election observers from the European Union.

But the election results suggest that many voters did not approve of Mr. Hernández’s growing control over the government.

But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.","Chris Donovan arrived in Flint after the scandal over the Michigan city’s contaminated water supply had been dominating national headlines. He was there, just like dozens of other journalists, covering the crisis. “When I first went, everything I was photographing was really obvious,” he said of his initial trip in 2015. “It was people handing out water, protests and people showering with bottled water.”

But the more he got to know the city and its people, the more frustrated he became with the popular narrative: that Flint was a bad place. So after the city’s turn in the breaking news spotlight, he has returned each year to tell the beleaguered city’s other stories.

He could relate: His hometown, Saint John, New Brunswick, is very much like Flint, with both industry and population shrinking. “I had no idea what to expect,” Mr. Donovan said, other than unemployed factory workers. He did find plenty of idled laborers, but he also found a city greater than the water crisis that still seemed to publicly define it long after the media had moved on.

Mr. Donovan was so dedicated to documenting that lesser-known side of Flint and its people that his friends gently teased him about spending spring break there. Mr. Donovan laughed and said it fits. He could either go back to his hometown in Canada or travel the much shorter five hours to Flint from Toronto, where he lives.

“I’ll continue to go back, and I’ll continue working in Flint probably the rest of my life, just because I have an attachment to the city and the story,” Mr. Donovan says.

His latest story is about the last high school football team in the city, The Jaguars. The team was born from the merger of two schools, Southwestern and Northwestern Academies, and their two teams: the Knights and the Wildcats. It also nods to the athletic history of the city, which has produced dozens of professional football players over the years.

Chris Wilson was one of those. He graduated from Flint Northern in 2000 and went on to play professionally, first in the Canadian Football League and for Washington’s N.F.L. team. He is now back home overseeing the school’s entire program — from 8-year-olds playing flag football to the varsity level playing full-contact.

He has a simple but much-needed mission: To instill hope and purpose in these young men, in much the same way those values were instilled in him.

“By having sports start early, not only do we put out better talent and create a better brand of football, but now kids can know how to go to school and get their work down and strive for a goal,” Mr. Wilson said. Rather than turning to the streets to make quick cash, young people can discover new options and possibilities for a positive life and career though the discipline and teamwork of sports.

Photo

The young men of the Flint Jaguars are, by all accounts, resilient and intelligent, growing up hard and playing a hard sport. To earn their trust, Mr. Donovan had to figuratively get off the bench. “A big part of the way that I work is sharing my own experiences with these kids to show them that I’m a human, that I’m not just there to take pictures and leave.”

He played basketball with them and talked with them, and their comfort with him is evident in his photos. Mr. Donovan is invisible on the field and the locker room, and the Jaguars are at ease around him enough to be themselves in their sport and in their emotions, whether those be grief, intensity or exultation. Under the stadium lights, or against the green school bus seats, they show up as young adherents of a beloved American sport.

Just as the rest of Flint has faced tough times, the school struggles financially, to the point that last year the sports program was hanging by a thread. The city is still plagued by toxic water, and off the field the players must contend with the dangers of every day life. But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.

Trey Huddleston gets ready for the homecoming dance while his mother watches; Alone Branch intently works out in the weight room, whether its football season or not. Jalynn Bond is somber one moment, walking through the neighborhood where he lost his brother to gun violence; the next, he’s grinning and flexing at his teammates in the locker room because one of them dared to suggest Mr. Bond was smaller.

As is his habit, Mr. Wilson stands at the center of them (Slide 7), leading a prayer to inspire the team before taking the field. At a game against their rivals, Saginaw High, a brawl erupted between players, and two police officers used pepper spray to break them up. Mr. Wilson and the other coaches restored order and handed out suspensions, but both he and Mr. Donovan criticized the use of pepper spray in ending a scuffle between teenagers, none of whom, Mr. Wilson noted, were being hostile to teachers or coaches.

The program still struggles, just like Flint still struggles. But while Mr. Wilson talks about those challenges and the sacrifices that have been made to keep this program running, he couches it in terms meant to motivate his Jaguars in their daily lives.

“If you haven’t folded already, in a poor city in America, dealing with a water crisis, guess what?” he said. “There’s nothing else out there for you. There’s nothing that’s gonna hit you harder than that.”

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen returns with a puzzle that puts things inside of other things, as opposed to Monty Python’s Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things.

Today’s Theme

I normally love Mr. Chen’s puzzles and he is a godsend to beginning puzzle makers who are learning the art of construction, but I have to say that this one confused me. I get the theme, but I believe that solvers will have to take the theme clues absolutely literally in order to solve it. I made this a lot harder on myself by expecting the answers to the clues to “read” like a new phrase, and they do not. As always, your mileage will vary.

If you solve cryptic crosswords, you are used to seeing indicator words in the clues. Words like “about” or “around” can indicate to solvers that they need to look for a word that is wrapped “around” another word, or that another word is inside. Keep that in mind as you solve. At 22A, for example, the clue “Lists about a port on the Black Sea” has as its answer ROYAL TASTERS, and the letters for YALTA are either shaded or circled. The word “about” in this clue means that the “Lists” are literally “about,” or wrapped around “a port on the Black Sea.”

Don’t see it? Let’s zoom in a little closer:

ROYAL TASTERS: YALTA is the Black Sea port

Now let’s see what’s “about” YALTA:

ROYAL TASTERS: ROSTERS is what’s “about” YALTA, and a roster is a list. “Lists about a post on the Black Sea.”

Got that?

Let’s try another one. At 92A, “Fear among underground workers” solves as MINDREADERS. That doesn’t really make sense, so let’s dice this up:

MINDREADERS: DREAD is “among” or inside “underground workers.”

MINDREADERS: Those “underground workers” are MINERS.

Those worked well for me, but not all of the theme entries hung together, in my opinion. Well, that’s not entirely true; they work under the strictest interpretation, but some of the phrases and clues Mr. Chen used seemed a bit random to me. “Flourishes around monsoon events,” for example, is an odd but lexical phrase. The answer, BRAIN SURGEONS, would be absolutely mystifying if you hadn’t gotten some of the easier theme entries first. BURGEONS means “Flourishes,” but it probably wouldn’t be my first guess, and it goes around RAINS, or “monsoon events.”

Like I said, stick to the literal interpretation of what the indicator words are asking you to do, and you’ll do fine.

“It’s mostly Handel now because he is really much better than anyone else writing then,” Ms. van Kampen said.","In 2014, Ms. van Kampen took her play to Dominic Dromgoole, then the artistic director at the Globe. “He said, ‘The bit I’m interested in is Farinelli, and if you do it, I’ll put it on,’” Ms. van Kampen recounted. She didn’t take him seriously, but shortly thereafter discovered that the play was listed in the Globe’s new season brochure. “Then I had to do it!” she said with a laugh.

“More seriously, I think I’ve always responded to people asking me to do things,” she added. “Perhaps Dominic thought it would be a collection of arias with a few words between. I don’t think he thought it would be a fully fledged play.”

Ms. van Kampen does use arias of the period, by Handel and Porpora, to both punctuate and accelerate her fully fledged play, mostly set in 1737, when Farinelli, invited by Elisabeth, the wife of Philippe, arrives at court. He immediately establishes a bond with the afflicted monarch (played by Mr. Rylance), first seen fishing from a goldfish bowl in his bedroom. The king is profoundly moved, and partially cured, by the purity of the castrato’s voice.

“This is not a straight play, nor is it a musical nor an opera,” said Ms. van Kampen. “It’s a hybrid form of all those things.” (The singer was also the subject of the biopic “Farinelli,” which won the 1995 Golden Globe for best foreign film.)

At first, Mr. Dove said, they weren’t sure how to best stage the singing. He and Ms. van Kampen decided that Farinelli would be played by two men: Mr. Crane, in the speaking role, and Mr. Davies, who steps onstage to sing as his alter ego stands quietly by. (James Hall will also sing the role on days when there are two performances.)

Both subject and form are ambitious, but Ms. van Kampen said she was not nervous about the play’s reception. “I had nothing to lose,” she said. “And once the audience laughed at the first preview, I was fine.”

“Farinelli and the King” won glowing reviews. “A richly unusual evening that not only demonstrates music’s curative power for a mad king but its ability to offer spiritual uplift to just about everyone else,” wrote Michael Billington in The Guardian after the premiere.

Ms. van Kampen, who trained as a pianist at the Royal College of Music, worked as a professional musician until she was 33, when a friend asked her to step in as the musical director for a production at the Royal Shakespeare Company. “As soon as I set foot in there, I knew it was for me,” she said. She met Mr. Rylance soon after, in 1987, and they married in 1989.

When he became artistic director of the newly founded Shakespeare’s Globe, Ms. van Kampen became its musical director, developing an extensive knowledge of Renaissance music. Compared with researching that era, she said, deciding upon the music for “Farinelli” was relatively easy. “The Baroque is not as unfamiliar to us, the orchestra is not very different to today and there is masses of written music,” she said.

Her years at the Globe, she added, also provided “a master class” in dramatic composition and in balancing the needs of music and prose in a play. She wrote and rewrote “Farinelli,” she said, with both Mr. Rylance and Mr. Dove (“absolutely fantastic on dramaturgy with new writers”) as sounding boards.

Mr. Rylance said that although they had talked constantly about the play, his wife hadn’t written it for him. “I don’t think I was initially available,” he said. “When I did join, I don’t think I changed anything, but Claire has known and watched me for a long time. She knows how to write for an instrument. I think she has put in those things I can do as an actor.”

Photo

He added, “For me, the essential questions are ‘Why did Farinelli give up the Michael Jackson career that he had in order to sing for one man for so many years?’ and ‘Why was the music healing?’”

The period was fascinating in terms of its attitudes toward mental illness, Ms. van Kampen said. “The church thought of insanity as demonic possession, but there were new approaches, too, like the belief that music could heal. The doctor in the play, very much a man of the Enlightenment, believes this.”

It was therefore vital, she said, that the powerful effect of the voice was dramatically convincing for audiences. Once Mr. Davies had accepted the singing role, she tailored her musical choices to the specific qualities of his voice, rather than trying to imitate the elusive sound of the castrato.

“When Claire rang, I originally thought no,” Mr. Davies said in a telephone interview from New York, where he was appearing in Thomas Adès’s “The Exterminating Angel” at the Metropolitan Opera. “Farinelli was a sopranist, with a much higher range than I have, and I thought a female voice would be better.” Finally, persuaded by Ms. van Kampen that it was the effect rather than strict historical authenticity that mattered, he agreed.

With what he described as “a pretty encyclopedic knowledge” of the period, he helped Ms. van Kampen decide on the arias; they have changed two for the Broadway production and added an additional song. “It’s mostly Handel now because he is really much better than anyone else writing then,” Ms. van Kampen said. (Although Farinelli didn’t sing in Handel’s company, she saw no reason that he couldn’t have learned the songs.)

“I try not to draw focus; I’m a bit like a ghost or a hologram,” Mr. Davies said. “I wouldn’t make the mistake of acting opposite Mark Rylance anyway.”

The arias, Ms. van Kampen said, are not about dazzling the audience with coloratura sound, but about the beauty and healing power of a voice. “The audience coming to the show is primarily not an opera audience,” she said. “I wanted to find something universal. Whether it’s Billie Holiday or Maria Callas or Iestyn Davies; if a voice moves us, we feel it.”",Writing Her Way From Backstage to Broadway,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/theater/farinelli-and-the-king-claire-van-kampen-play.html

After Mr. Trump named him as his national security adviser in November, Mr. Flynn began briefing him — some say daily — on foreign policy.
In his phone call with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Flynn asked that Russia “not escalate the situation,” according to court documents released on Friday.
A phone call that included Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn, Ms. McFarland, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon was scheduled for 5 p.m., shortly after Ms. McFarland’s email exchange.
Mr. Cobb said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak in the call.","But it is evident from the emails — which were obtained from someone who had access to transition team communications — that after learning that President Barack Obama would expel 35 Russian diplomats, the Trump team quickly strategized about how to reassure Russia. The Trump advisers feared that a cycle of retaliation between the United States and Russia would keep the spotlight on Moscow’s election meddling, tarnishing Mr. Trump’s victory and potentially hobbling his presidency from the start.

As part of the outreach, Ms. McFarland wrote, Mr. Flynn would be speaking with the Russian ambassador, Mr. Kislyak, hours after Mr. Obama’s sanctions were announced.

“Key will be Russia’s response over the next few days,” Ms. McFarland wrote in an email to another transition official, Thomas P. Bossert, now the president’s homeland security adviser.

In an interview, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the Russia inquiry, said there was nothing illegal or unethical about the transition team’s actions. “It would have been political malpractice not to discuss sanctions,” he said, adding that “the presidential transition guide specifically encourages contact with and outreach to foreign dignitaries.”

The only problem, Mr. Cobb said, was that Mr. Flynn had lied to White House officials and to F.B.I. agents about what he had told the Russian ambassador. Mr. Flynn’s misstatements led to his firing in February and his guilty plea on Friday to charges of lying to federal agents.

With Mr. Flynn’s plea and agreement to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Russian election interference, the inquiry edges closer to Mr. Trump. The president tried to persuade the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to drop the bureau’s criminal investigation of Mr. Flynn, and fired Mr. Comey after he failed to comply.

Mr. Trump and his aides have suggested that his concern about Mr. Flynn’s potential legal jeopardy was motivated mainly by the president’s admiration for his former national security adviser’s military service and character.

But the new details about Mr. Flynn’s Russia contacts underscore the possibility that the president may have been worried not just about Mr. Flynn but also about whether any investigation might reach into the White House and perhaps to the Oval Office. That question will be at the center of any consideration by Mr. Mueller of whether Mr. Trump’s actions constituted obstruction of justice.

The Trump transition team ignored a pointed request from the Obama administration to avoid sending conflicting signals to foreign officials before the inauguration and to include State Department personnel when contacting them. Besides the Russian ambassador, Mr. Flynn, at the request of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, contacted several other foreign officials to urge them to delay or block a United Nations resolution condemning Israel over its building of settlements.

Mr. Cobb said the Trump team had never agreed to avoid such interactions. But one former White House official has disputed that, telling Mr. Mueller’s investigators that Trump transition officials had agreed to honor the Obama administration’s request.

Mr. Bossert forwarded Ms. McFarland’s Dec. 29 email exchange about the sanctions to six other Trump advisers, including Mr. Flynn; Reince Priebus, who had been named as chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the senior strategist; and Sean Spicer, who would become the press secretary.

Mr. Obama, she wrote, was trying to “box Trump in diplomatically with Russia,” which could limit his options with other countries, including Iran and Syria. “Russia is key that unlocks door,” she wrote.

She also wrote that the sanctions over Russian election meddling were intended to “lure Trump in trap of saying something” in defense of Russia, and were aimed at “discrediting Trump’s victory by saying it was due to Russian interference.”

“If there is a tit-for-tat escalation Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia, which has just thrown U.S.A. election to him,” she wrote.

Mr. Bossert replied by urging all the top advisers to “defend election legitimacy now.”

Mr. Flynn, who had been fired by Mr. Obama as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was the point person for the transition team on policy toward Russia and other countries. After Mr. Trump named him as his national security adviser in November, Mr. Flynn began briefing him — some say daily — on foreign policy.

Ms. McFarland, who served until May as deputy national security adviser and is awaiting confirmation as ambassador to Singapore, was sometimes referred to by other transition officials as “Flynn’s brain.” She could not be reached for comment.

Mr. Flynn’s Dec. 29 call with Mr. Kislyak was one of the first formal interactions between the incoming administration and a foreign government. On that winter day, Mr. Trump’s closest associates were scattered around several warm-weather locations.

Mr. Flynn was in the Dominican Republic. Other senior members of Mr. Trump’s transition team, including Ms. McFarland, were at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Kushner was vacationing in Hawaii with his family.

Obama administration officials were expecting a “bellicose” response to the expulsions and sanctions, according to the email exchange between Ms. McFarland and Mr. Bossert. Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser, had told Mr. Bossert that “the Russians have already responded with strong threats, promising to retaliate,” according to the emails.

In his phone call with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Flynn asked that Russia “not escalate the situation,” according to court documents released on Friday. He later related the substance of the call — including the discussion of sanctions — to a senior transition official, believed to be Ms. McFarland. A few days later, he briefed others on the transition team.

Mr. Flynn’s intervention appeared to have a dramatic effect. To the surprise of foreign policy experts, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not immediately respond with retaliatory expulsions of Americans from Moscow.

Mr. Trump praised that decision in a tweet, writing: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart.”

It is uncertain how involved Mr. Trump was in the discussions among his staff members of Mr. Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador. Mr. Spicer told reporters on the morning of Dec. 29 that the president-elect would be meeting with his national security team, including Ms. McFarland, that day. A phone call that included Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn, Ms. McFarland, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon was scheduled for 5 p.m., shortly after Ms. McFarland’s email exchange. It is unclear whether the call took place.

Mr. Cobb said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak in the call. After the inauguration, “Flynn specifically denied it to him, in the presence of witnesses,” he said.

Some legal experts have speculated that the contacts during the transition between Trump aides and foreign officials might violate the Logan Act, a law that prohibits private American citizens from working with a foreign government against the United States. But the act has not been used to prosecute anyone since the 19th century. Mr. Cobb said the law “certainly does not apply” to a presidential transition team.

The day after the president fired Mr. Flynn, he talked about the F.B.I. inquiry with Mr. Comey, the agency’s director. Mr. Comey has said the president urged him to drop the inquiry. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump said, according to a memo that Mr. Comey wrote immediately afterward. The White House has denied that account. The president fired Mr. Comey in May.

Testifying before Congress in June, Mr. Comey declined to say whether the president had fired him to impede the investigation. “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct,” he said. “I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that’s an offense.”",Emails Dispute White House Claims That Flynn Acted Independently on Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/russia-mcfarland-flynn-trump-emails.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

We use them as prisms for discussions of privilege, of class, of tradition, of race (in the case of Ms. Markle), of what Britain was and what it should be. We examine them through their sometimes parasitic, sometimes symbiotic relationship with the British news media, which treats them at times as if they were little more than upper-crust Kardashians.

Covering the British royal family isn’t like covering a normal family. You’re not going to get anything out of them. They’re masters of the no-content remark. Their public appearances are tightly controlled, and their activities most days — showing up at charity events, making boring remarks and leaving — are not in themselves raucously exciting to behold. When they give interviews, it’s usually to British news organizations, and always under the most anodyne of circumstances.

And of course they’re not our royal family, so it’s hard to regard them with anything like the awe they provoke in pro-monarchy Britons. (Many Britons, of course, wish they would just go away.) I’ve met a few of them, and I can report that they are much as you might imagine, only more so.

Once, at a meet-the-princess lunch, I watched Diana reduce a bunch of seasoned (male) American foreign correspondents to spineless blobs of obsequious jelly competing to express their sympathy for how hard her life must be and bragging about how arduous their jobs were. (“Richard Gere is renting a house down the street from me, and so I can see something of what you must go through every day with the paparazzi,” said one. “I work for a newspaper in Los Angeles, and have to write on deadline with an eight-hour time difference,” said another.)

My favorite royal encounter happened to an American friend some years ago. It was at a fancy party outside London at which the queen was a surprise guest. My friend had not yet had dinner, but she had had several glasses of Champagne.

A receiving line formed. The queen stood next to an aide whose job it was to whisper in her ear a little tidbit about the identity of each new person, including where they come from.

“I understand that you’re from Texas,” she said, as the line moved along. My friend, addled by drink and confused by the queen’s clipped accent, thought she said “Have you paid your taxes?”

And so she responded the way any American would, when asked such a personal question by a British monarch. Looking at the queen with her best republican expression, she declared, “No taxation without representation!”

D.J.I. dominates the overall drone market, with a nearly two-thirds share in the United States and Canada, according to Skylogic Research, a drone research firm. To grow beyond hobbyists, the company has been targeting commercial customers, like utilities, law enforcement and property developers.

The allegations could not be independently confirmed, and a spokeswoman for I.C.E. declined to comment. In a statement to The New York Times, a D.J.I. spokesman said that users can control how much access the company can have to their data and that it shares data only “pursuant to appropriate legal process.”

The accusations point to a broadening debate in both the United States and China over how to secure vast data reserves that are being vacuumed up by commercial technology companies. Likened by metaphor-minded tech types to gold or oil, data has become a hugely valuable way to suss out market trends and target ads.

Now equipped with remote sensing technology to monitor crops, infrared scanners to scrutinize power lines, cameras and tracking systems, drones — much like smartphones — are the stuff of espionage dreams. Customers often have little knowledge of where their data might end up, experts said, while D.J.I. and others give themselves considerable leeway in the fine print of their user agreements to transfer data across borders.

American intelligence and political circles are beginning to consider how companies and governments manage the data they collect. Given that major Chinese companies must maintain close ties to the government, new China tech players like D.J.I. have raised particular concerns.

This summer, the United States Army issued guidance calling for forces to stop using D.J.I. drones because of unspecified security vulnerabilities.

Yet those worries have not spread widely to customers, according to Colin Snow, chief executive of Skylogic.

“Only those few who use drones around critical infrastructure are concerned and chose not to use D.J.I.,” Mr. Snow said in an email. “The rest don’t care because of the price/benefit of D.J.I. aircraft.”

Chinese officials expressed similar concerns in the wake of Edward J. Snowden’s disclosures that American companies aid in Washington’s electronic espionage efforts. A recent cybersecurity law calls for companies like Microsoft and Apple to store data within China’s borders. Earlier this year Apple said it would build a new data center in China to meet that requirement.

The I.C.E. memo listed what it said were a number of examples of D.J.I. drones used in potentially sensitive areas. It said that a Department of Homeland Security facility built to study diseases that threaten American agriculture and public health used D.J.I. drones to assist with construction layout and security. The agency did not respond to a request for comment.

The memo said in other cases, water reserves, power plants, rail hubs and other large-scale infrastructure were often monitored by Chinese-made drones.

“Much of the information collected includes proprietary and sensitive critical infrastructure data, such as detailed imagery of power control panels, security measures for critical infrastructure sites, or materials used in bridge construction,” the memo said.

D.J.I. said that consumers have total control over whether to upload data, such as flight plans and video, to the company’s servers. Yet like many apps, the company’s software encourages such uploads. D.J.I.’s app offers an automatic function to store user flight logs periodically, though it can be turned off. Out of concerns about data protection, the company added a feature last year that allows a drone pilot to cut off any connection to the outside internet while flying.

A new D.J.I. product set up to help large companies, government agencies, farms and law enforcement manage drones, uploads a large amount of critical data — like flight plans, video and location — to servers. D.J.I. said it was working out the terms of service for the product, and will likely include an option to allow companies to store data to their own servers.

Similar concerns have emerged in China over Apple’s products. In particular, state-run media have showed how the iPhone keeps track of a user’s commonly visited locations. Turning off the function requires a journey deep into the phone’s settings. Apple has said it has strong data privacy and security protections in place in China.

For D.J.I., questions about its data storage practices are not new. Last year company officials told The New York Times that it complied with Chinese government requests to hand over data it collects in China and Hong Kong.

More recently, one security expert recently outlined how D.J.I. left key digital information accessible to the public that could allow someone to look at customer data on its servers, including military and government flight logs. In a statement, D.J.I. said it hired an independent cybersecurity firm to investigate the report and the impact of any unauthorized access to consumer data.

Dan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group, a computer-security company, said such weaknesses were often a bad sign.

“In my experience doing security assessments I’ve never found a massive pile of egregiously staggering security problems somewhere to then find a shining, palace of hardened impenetrable security elsewhere in the org,” he wrote in a Twitter message.

In terms of companies with major security vulnerabilities in one part of the company, he added, “it’ll be a Dumpster fire the whole way through.”","Drone Maker D.J.I. May Be Sending Data to China, U.S. Officials Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/technology/dji-china-data-drones.html

When I drove, I was early to every meeting. It was the American dream! Except it wasn’t: As I meandered down mostly empty four-lane freeways in my Ford Fiesta rental, I became acutely aware that, unlike on the Slow Roll or Q-Line, I wasn’t meeting anyone. I was alone, trapped in a cocoon. The car, once hailed as the key to every major United States city, is essentially the undoing of organic urban cohesion.

While in the past Ford and G.M. have been accused of ignoring the needs of their hometown, both car companies have begun to shift toward embracing the 21st-century Detroit citizen, who either cannot afford to own a car or else might choose not to. Ford in particular has rebranded itself as a “mobility” company, investing heavily in new ride sharing technology.

I visited Ford’s sprawling campus in Dearborn, Mich., and met with Jessica Robinson, director of City Solutions, in a towering white garage space surrounded by Ford Fusions that had been converted into autonomous vehicles, their trunks stuffed full of processors. A nearby screen eerily displayed the world from the car’s perspective. I was a green flickering blob.

“We can’t just think like a car company anymore,” Ms. Robinson said. “We have to become ethnographers. So we went into communities and asked how people were getting around to try and address solutions from the ground up.”

Ford started a competition called Go Detroit Challenge, which funded six Detroit tech companies working on innovative transportation solutions including CART, a program which pairs customers, ride share companies, and grocery stores to enable low-income populations greater access to healthy food.

This year both Ford and G.M. have doubled down on the potent combo of electric vehicles and driverless technology. This was also the year I finally took the plunge and bought Chevy’s all-electric Bolt EV, which features a range of 248 miles per charge. Driving the Bolt for the first time was an emotional experience for me; it was like touching the future. No more gas stations, no more emissions. The clean torque of an electric engine, both whisper-quiet and instantaneous, is addictive. I will never go back.

As more cars like the Bolt EV become available, it’s exciting to see car companies in the United States once again on the forefront of innovation. Maybe one day Detroit’s beautiful, empty interstates will turn into rivers of individuated, autonomous mass transit. Everyone can read novels while they get whisked around in driverless Lyft vehicles. It sounds utopic. It also sounds sterile. Such algorithmic efficiency is the opposite of Slow Roll’s messy, collaborative, communalism.

I found myself discussing cars and community (and novels!) with Susan Murphy, the owner of Pages Bookshop on Grand River Avenue in the Grandmont-Rosedale neighborhood. Grandmont-Rosedale is a diverse enclave caught in a no man’s land: far from the bustle of downtown but still within Detroit’s city limits. In many ways, however, places like Grandmont-Rosedale are the heart of Detroit. The neighborhood has managed to resist the wide-scale blight that affected many of the surrounding areas in part because of an active community organization, the Grandmont Rosedale Development Corporation (G.R.D.C.), which helps organize a local farmers market, repairs dilapidated housing stock and provides assistance and retail space to small businesses like Pages.

Ms. Murphy’s shop is cozy and curated; it’s one of those magical places where you want to linger for hours. Pip, the resident black-and-white feline, prowled the new fiction section as Ms. Murphy described the challenges of running an independent bookshop perched on the edge of Grand River Avenue, one of Detroit’s many four-lane corridors that cars often use as their own private Grand Prix. These roads were designed to get drivers out to the suburbs as quickly as possible. They were not designed to create urban communities.

“It’s difficult to get people to stop,” Ms. Murphy said. “We have to get creative with our programming. But the community here has been so supportive. This is a neighborhood of readers.” She is hopeful that Detroit Vegan Soul, opening next door, will create a critical mass of foot traffic, the beginning of a movement: BBQ tofu and Elena Ferrante. The G.R.D.C. is also in ongoing conversation with the city about small but powerful infrastructural changes like traffic-calming curb extensions, raised crosswalks, or grassy medians that will encourage people to slow down and perhaps even buy a book.

SUCH STRUCTURAL REIMAGINING seems important to making Detroit more people and environmentally friendly. A 21st-century city now incorporates rainwater catchment gardens and solar parks and car-charging stations into its designs. But again and again I came up against this idea that true urban sustainability cannot be about infrastructure alone. True sustainability is dependent upon people.

The good news is that Detroiters are perhaps Detroit’s greatest asset. They have never stopped innovating and caring, and nowhere is this more evident than in the vast proliferation of urban gardens and farms that dot the city’s landscape.

Photo

In many ways, Detroit seems ideal for such an urban agricultural revolution: What better way to activate those 40 square miles of vacant lots than to turn them into farmland? If you visit the vast farmers market in Eastern Market on weekends you will find a cornucopia of local produce from some of the city’s 1,400 gardens and farms.

For Malik Yakini, executive director of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, urban agriculture cannot simply be about profits; it must be an act of social justice. Mr. Yakini founded D-Town Farm, a seven-acre farm near Grandmont-Rosedale, as an education center to teach children about self-empowerment, food production and environmental stewardship, with a particular emphasis on African traditions of planting and harvest.

I visited D-Town Farm on a dense, humid day in July. Mr. Yakini was busy mowing the fields. “Give me a second,” he said. “You can go to work if you’d like.” I joined a University of Michigan masters student and a farmer named Babatunde as they thinned tiny corn sprouts. There is something instantly gratifying about plunging your hands into soil still cool from the night. With a simple touch I had made contact with the food chain.

“It’s about food sovereignty,” Mr. Yakini said when he finished mowing. “Many people in this city don’t have access to fresh food. They aren’t in control of the food-delivery systems. We’re trying to hand that back to people.” As part of this hand back, D-Town has plans of opening the Detroit Food Commons, an ambitious development that will include a co-op grocery store, a community incubator kitchen and a lecture hall. These are the future palaces of the food sovereign.

RecoveryPark, on Detroit’s East Side, provides another model of urban farming entirely. The farm is in an area that was particularly hard hit by the city’s downturn. There are more vacant lots than houses.

“We found that in order to be profitable you really need at least 10 acres,” said Gary Wozniak, RecoveryPark’s founder. “You need to go large scale.” To this end, RecoveryPark has purchased or acquired over 400 parcels of land, totaling about 60 acres in all. They are essentially a commercial farm that just happens to be in a city. A key component of RecoveryPark’s mission is to offer jobs and training to addicts and those in recovery programs who would otherwise struggle to find work.

Photo

“We’re in this for the long term,” Mr. Wozniak said. “In Detroit, you have to be.”

On paper, RecoveryPark’s business plan is a thing of beauty, a potentially unprecedented model of urban farming. But looking over the vast expansion plans of commercial greenhouses, hoop houses and indoor tilapia farms, I found myself wondering: Can we still call this an urban neighborhood? It’s like a Zen koan: If you plop a 60-acre farm in the middle of a city, is it still a city? Where are the sidewalks? Where are the places for casual contact?

ON MY LAST VISIT to Detroit in July, I stayed at the Ark, one of the more unusual places I’ve ever found on Airbnb. It’s a solar-powered shipping container shack in the middle of an urban farm called Food Field. The farm, run by Noah Link, stands on the site of an abandoned convent. There’s an orchard of fruit trees and emus perambulate right out your back door. Food Field has an on-site farm stand and sells to a range of Detroit institutions including the chic Selden Standard restaurant and the Detroit Zen Center.

At the Ark, everything is off-grid. The solar panels feed a limited bank of batteries, and so I became profoundly aware of my electrical usage. A box fan, when left on, would cut out in the middle of the night. I would sweat and curse the simultaneous hipness and impermeability of shipping container shacks until the roosters roused me at dawn.

The Ark, for all of its lumps, strikes me as a wonderfully adaptive place — Noah supplants his farm income as a host for out-of-town guests and these guests are in turn introduced to the infectious, survivalist spirit of Detroit. The Ark, like the city itself, is not always comfortable, but it is an experience you will never forget.

As I was leaving the Ark for the airport, my phone beeped. It was Ben Wolf, the shipping container fabricator. He had forgotten to tell me about his next project. He was working with a Shakespearean enthusiast to build a mobile, three-story Globe Theater completely out of repurposed shipping containers. They were going to tour the theater around the city, performing Shakespeare’s complete works for the masses.

Ms. Chaulk wanted to get answers from someone who knew and understood her situation. It turned out that person was not the therapist, but Mr. Hertwig.

Indeed, one ponders the mysterious ways of chance and fate after learning that Ms. Chaulk visited the therapist just once (after couples counseling). Meeting Mr. Hertwig that day in the waiting room was “a total fluke” and “surreal,” she said.

She found talking with the husband of the woman that her husband was having an affair with more therapeutic than any therapy session.

For one thing, she was able, through Mr. Hertwig, to “piece together some of the timeline,” she said, to better know what had happened by comparing their spouses’ behavior and schedules over the previous months. “I’ll never get the full story,” she said. “But having some sense helped me find some closure and move on.”

It also helped that Mr. Hertwig knew exactly what she was going through because he was going through it, too. “With some of my friends, they were so angry on my behalf and I didn’t want the anger,” Ms. Chaulk said. “Whereas Benjamin and I could express a wide spectrum of feelings.

Mr. Hertwig, looking back on the encounter four years later, had a similar assessment of his conversations with Ms. Chaulk, who had “experienced the flip side of the coin,” he said. Being able to talk to her likewise for him made the therapist largely unnecessary. What was more helpful, he said, was “the feeling of looking across at someone who had experienced much of what I experienced and felt what I had felt.”

Mr. Hertwig is a former soldier who had served in Afghanistan, a difficult experience he was struggling with. In his essay, he said he was “attracted to her strength — maybe to her as well.” How did Ms. Chaulk feel in that moment?

For so long in her relationship with her husband, she said, “I’d been lying to my friends and everyone, pretending all was well when it wasn’t. During that time in the cafe, I was willing to look it in the eye and embrace it and make a plan. That was the first time I was honest with myself and how I was feeling.”

If she felt a similar romantic spark toward Mr. Hertwig, it was because they were communicating honestly, she said, “and because we so clearly were on the same page. We had some very similar values. Being able to share that with someone was intimate in its own way.”

These days, Ms. Chaulk is a nurse in the same Canadian city where the story takes place. She is divorced from her husband, with whom she shares custody of their son, and is currently in a long-term relationship.

Every now and then, she said, she dusts off Mr. Hertwig’s essay. “Rereading it puts me back in a place where I was the most honest I’ve been with myself,” Ms. Chaulk said. “I use that story as a checkpoint so that I maintain that.”

Mr. Hertwig is now a Ph.D. student in English in Vancouver, British Columbia. He said he has more emotional distance from both his divorce and his military service, and better understands how the two were interconnected. He recently published a book of poetry, “Slow War,” that deals with these topics.

Mr. Hertwig is no longer in contact with his ex-wife. He has been dating the same woman for several years, and he also communicates with Ms. Chaulk every so often through Facebook. Despite their brief interaction, and the unhappy circumstances under which it took place, Mr. Hertwig said he will always feel “linked” to her, even as the years pass.

“Because however brief, it was important to me,” he said.

But it also implies her absence from her own family’s holiday meal, whether that was the case or not. Ms. Barney, who has spent a lot of her career photographing theatrical tableaus of affluent, if cold, New York society, said she found relief in the rituals of her adopted Rhode Island community.

“There is a warm family feeling in that town, and it’s why I love it,” she said, adding that she might be the only person, as a native New Yorker, to lock the door in her area. “There is a feeling of intimacy and warmth I did not grow up with.”

Does it matter that Mr. Phillips’s wedding cakes are individually created and may even, in some sense, be “art”? No. Many goods and services, from bespoke suits to bathroom tiling, involve professional and even artistic judgment by the people we hire to execute them. But just because something is aesthetically pleasing or involves creativity and even passion does not mean the activity of creating that object can be insulated from ordinary laws governing business practices. First Amendment law is abundant on this point. If Mr. Phillips decided that he could not be true to his muse without the use of banned coloring agents, would the food safety laws have to yield? Of course not.

And so the simplest and best way out of this case would be for the Supreme Court to avoid the messy question of whether bakery products are constitutionally protected expression. Colorado is not seeking to impose its aesthetic, political or religious judgment on Mr. Phillips’s art. It is just saying that he can’t discriminate among the people who seek to buy his art.

An anti-discrimination law is a regulation not of expression, but of conduct. Like many other states, Colorado prohibits Mr. Phillips, as the owner of a business open to the public, from refusing to sell certain products to certain customers based on their race, religion, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics. It is well settled that such laws are constitutional. If Picasso opened a shop in Colorado to sell his paintings, the same rules would apply to him.

Even if we were to grant that Mr. Phillips is engaged in some form of self-expression, the Supreme Court has explained many times that the First Amendment does not prevent generally applicable social and business regulations from imposing incidental burdens on speech. For example, newspapers may not be censored, but their owners may be required, like all other businesses, to pay taxes, even if they would rather use the money to do more investigative reporting.

Mr. Phillips might have a legitimate right to refuse to make a cake carrying certain words or images he finds offensive, just as an African-American baker could refuse to decorate something with a white-power symbol. But that is not this case. He refused service to the gay couple before they even talked about any design.

Mr. Phillips has become an icon for evangelicals who imagine themselves as a beleaguered minority battling the social and legal consensus in favor of L.G.B.T. equality. A brief by a group of conservative academics compares him to the Jehovah’s Witnesses children in a landmark 1943 Supreme Court decision who fought for the right to refuse to salute the flag. But the two situations are so factually and legally remote that the analogy cannot be taken seriously.

No one has required Mr. Phillips to pledge allegiance to gay marriage. Nor has anyone denied him the freedom to speak, write or pray against it. Mr. Phillips is not a church, a political pamphleteer or a schoolchild being forced to honor a graven image. He is a small-business owner who makes and sells pretty things to eat.

That is honest and important work, but the First Amendment does not give merchants like him the right to refuse to comply with anti-discrimination statutes just because they think their personal beliefs are more important.

Last week, I watched our president interrupt a White House ceremony honoring the Navajo code talkers to degrade Senator Elizabeth Warren by referring to her as Pocahontas. In front of a painting of the signer of the Indian Removal Act himself, Andrew Jackson. Weeks deep into Native American Heritage month. It was like the worst game of Clue. The president disrespecting my elders, in the cellarium, with the tiki torch. I felt rage. More than usual, which is crazy, because since the election I pretty much use a steady supply of mozzarella sticks to soften my constant fury.

Since that ceremony, more than the disbelief — because of course he would do that — one thought keeps coming back to me. It is the root of my frustration: Donald Trump would make a terrible Navajo. Now, I know what you’re thinking, “We don’t know that. Forty-five might make a terrific Navajo.” Well, hear me out.

First, Navajos serve in the military. Not me, but a lot of us do. Native Americans enlist in the military at a higher per capita rate than any other racial demographic. Many of the code talkers even doctored their birth certificates so they could join early.

Navajos respect women. Precontact, my tribe was matrilineal. Women owned all the property and ran everything. Historically speaking, we were also cool with trans people and immigrants.

Navajos actually close deals. You think Donald Trump could sell a $300 hand drum to a nice woman from Minnesota whose husband is trying to drag her away? Because I did that when I was 9.

We can handle being hated. Not just by white people which, hoo boy, there’s definitely that, but also by other Natives. We’re one of the largest of the 500-plus federally recognized tribes in the United States. We’re basically Regina George from “Mean Girls.” Get a group of Natives together and I guarantee they will bond by complaining about Navajos. And we don’t care, because people with real power don’t care what others think of them.

Navajos are funnier than the president. Like legitimately funny. Because we’re biting, which is a polite way of saying we’re mean. Personally, I love Senator Warren and can’t wait for her to be president, but I or any random Navajo could have come up with better burns for her than Mr. Trump did: “Elizabeth Snorin’ ”; “Human PowerPoint”; “Government Drone.”

And this is probably a small thing, but Navajos don’t, say, direct people to meet with Russian ambassadors as a means to potentially undermine our democracy.

I just really don’t think he has what it takes, for all of those reasons, but mostly because many Navajos, the code talkers specifically, truly love this country, despite everything it’s done to try to erase us from it. And in three years who knows where the president will be, but I know those proud Marine veterans will still be representing their land and its people. They inspire us to remember that in the recesses of our discouraging past, there are still flashes of grace, dignity and bravery. I hold onto that notion every day.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Every now and then, a new constructor comes roaring around the bend and shows us how to make puzzle construction look effortless. Brian Thomas offers us a puzzle with a theme that might not seem entirely original, but enough time has elapsed since the last one and Mr. Thomas’ theme is different and tighter than the older one so that I could give it a pass.

I’m glad I did. This is a really nice debut that makes good use of a simple theme and some decent fill.

Today’s Theme

What I liked about Mr. Thomas’ theme, beside the smooth solve, is that it’s a story — and I love stories. That in itself helps the theme hang together, and today we are watching an international car race. Once you get one theme entry you can probably guess the rest of them; they’re old puns but put together, the theme winds up being fun.

As the race starts at 19A, the car from Warsaw pulls into first, or POLE INTO FIRST. At 30A, you can hear the car from Moscow RUSSIAN PAST. I’ll let you discover who wins, and point you instead to the debuts of BONE MASS and SCRUNCHIE.

“The Rohingya are finished in our country,” said Mr. Kyaw Min, who lives in Yangon, the commercial capital of Myanmar. “Soon we will all be dead or gone.”

The United Nations report also said that the crackdown in Rakhine had “targeted teachers, the cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya history, culture and knowledge.”

“We are people with our own history and traditions,” said U Kyaw Hla Aung, a Rohingya lawyer and former political prisoner, whose father served as a court clerk in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.

“How can they pretend we are nothing?” he asked.

Speaking over the phone, Mr. Kyaw Hla Aung, who has been jailed repeatedly for his activism and is now interned in a Sittwe camp, said his family did not have enough food because officials have prevented full distribution of international aid.

The man, who grew up in Illinois, said he had met Mr. Levine at the Ravinia Festival, the summer music event Mr. Levine led as music director from 1973 through 1993, according to the police report. The New York Post first reported details from the report Saturday.

The man told the police that he was a music lover with dreams of becoming a conductor, and that he was 4 years old when his parents first took him to meet Mr. Levine at Ravinia. He told the police that the misconduct began in the summer of 1985, when he was 15 and Mr. Levine was in his early 40s. He told the police that Mr. Levine drove him home and, in the driveway of his family’s home in Kenilworth, “started holding my hand in a prolonged and incredibly sensual way.”

He said that Mr. Levine told him he wanted “to see if you can be raised special like me.”

The abuse escalated the following summer, the man told the police, when he would visit Mr. Levine at the Deer Path Inn, a hotel near Ravinia.

“I would get there and the lights are off, and he would say to me after I came in and after a hug ‘take your clothes off,’” the man wrote in a statement to the police.

“On various occasions he would ask me how I touched myself and then he would touch me the way I touched myself,” the man wrote. “I was never able to be aroused by this. But then he would masturbate himself at his bed or in the bathroom.”

The police report contains a college recommendation that Mr. Levine wrote for the man on Met stationery in 1987. In it, Mr. Levine wrote that he had known the teenager for “almost fifteen years.” The man also told the police that Mr. Levine had given him money over the years, which he estimated added up to $50,000.

Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, said Saturday night that the company would begin an investigation of Mr. Levine.

“This first came to the Met’s attention when the Illinois police investigation was opened in October of 2016,” Mr. Gelb said. “At the time Jim said that the charges were completely false, and we didn’t hear anything further from the police. We need to determine if these charges are true and, if they are, take appropriate action. We will now be conducting our own investigation with outside resources.”

The man told the police that the abuse went on for years, and that “this pattern repeated itself hundreds of times,” later continuing in New York City. At one point, the man wrote, Mr. Levine invited him to New York for an audition to see if he had the makings of a conductor — and concluded that he did not, and that he should focus on his other talents. “While the musical mentorship potential was over at the end of the audition, the promise of his raising me ‘special’ like him never ended,” he wrote in the statement to the police.

The man told the police that he “only recently realized” that his history with Mr. Levine was affecting his life in “a negative manner.” The police report indicates that Lake Forest detectives interviewed Mr. Gelb of the Met and several journalists who have written about Mr. Levine over the years. Detective Wendy Dumont of the Lake Forest Police declined to comment when reached Saturday.

Beth Glynn, a former board member at the Met Opera, confirmed on Saturday that she had spoken with a police detective after having been called by the man accusing Mr. Levine of misconduct.

“I don’t know how he got my number,” she said in a brief phone interview. “I told him twice he must call the police and I hung up.”

Mr. Levine, 74, is among the world’s most famous and influential conductors, a star of European festivals and American orchestras alike. But his commitment to the Met is unprecedented — he has been virtually synonymous with it since he became its music director four decades ago. He has led more than 2,500 performances with the company, more than any other conductor — expanding its repertory, spurring the creation of its young artists’ program and raising its orchestra’s level to that of the world’s finest symphonic ensembles. Mr. Levine was paid $1.8 million for the 2015-16 season, according to the Met’s most recent tax filings.

But rumors about Mr. Levine and sexual abuse have also circulated for years. Johanna Fiedler, who was the Met’s press representative for 15 years, wrote about them in her 2001 book “Molto Agitato: The Mayhem Behind the Music at the Metropolitan Opera.”

“Starting in the spring of 1979, these stories came to the surface at more or less regular intervals,” she wrote. “Each time, the Met press office would tirelessly point out the cyclical nature of the gossip and the complete lack of substance.”

In 1987 Mr. Levine dismissed the rumors in an interview with The Times, recalling that he had been told years earlier that there were “reports of a morals charge in Pittsburgh or Hawaii or Dallas.”

“Both my friends and my enemies checked it out and to this day, I don’t have the faintest idea where those rumors came from or what purpose they served,” Mr. Levine said at the time.

In recent years Mr. Levine has struggled with health problems and surgeries, which caused him to resign as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, after seven seasons, in 2011. He missed two Met seasons after sustaining a spinal injury that year.

He returned in 2013, but complications related to his Parkinson’s disease sometimes caused his left arm to flail and made it increasingly difficult for performers to follow his conducting. He stepped down from his position in April 2016, becoming the Met’s music director emeritus.

Mr. Levine’s physical capacities have lately seemed to improve, and he has a robust schedule at the Met this season, already leading a run of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” and Verdi’s Requiem this fall. He has jumped into a new production of Puccini’s “Tosca” set to premiere on New Year’s Eve, with Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” and “Luisa Miller” to follow in coming months.

He was just days away from announcing a plan to deal with the power failures that had plagued his state for years.

On his phone came Twitter notification after Twitter notification with news that would upend his plan: Mr. Musk had offered to build the most powerful battery ever made, and do it faster than ever imagined.

Recalling that moment, Mr. Weatherill said he started to sweat. If he embraced Mr. Musk’s proposal, would it look like a billionaire American entrepreneur was strong-arming his state into redefining its energy policy? Was Mr. Musk’s offer real, or merely a publicity stunt?

“Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free,” Mr. Musk tweeted. “That serious enough for you?”

“Of course, the whole thing then exploded, and everyone’s piling on me, saying ‘Grab it!’” Mr. Weatherill said at a conference in Adelaide, the state’s capital, in September.

For Mr. Weatherill, the project has been a repudiation of a federal policy that de-emphasizes renewable energy. For Mr. Musk, the battery has been a headline-grabbing venture that could prove that his radical vision of the world’s energy future is both functional and economical.

“This fits into his M.O. of doing these big, grandstanding things to get attention for the company and the technology that he’s building,” said Ashlee Vance, the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Musk. “Tesla’s at this really critical stage where they’re trying to be both a car company and an energy company at the same time.”

Australia is a fitting target for Mr. Musk. The country is the world’s largest exporter of coal. By most measures, it is the sunniest continent on earth. It has abundant wind and hydroelectric power capabilities. And yet the cost of electricity in Australia increased 20 percent from 2012 to 2016, and Australians this year paid between 50 and 100 percent more for their power than Americans, according to experts.

South Australia has the highest electricity prices in the world. This imbalance of supply and demand has resulted in regular blackouts and astronomical bills for the state’s 1.7 million residents.

The high-capacity Tesla battery does not create energy, it just stores it. The state already invests in wind and solar energy. The battery would give it a bank of saved energy, which could ease pressure during periods of high demand and help better manage the electrical grid.

“More than 40 percent of South Australia’s electricity is coming from wind, which is good,” said Tony Wood, an energy director at the Grattan Institute, a think tank. “But the consideration of how to integrate it — and manage that intermittency — wasn’t so good.”

The day after Mr. Weatherill was roused from his couch in March, he and Mr. Musk spoke on the phone about the proposal. The Australian, knowing the tech mogul’s ability to stir the news media, had one demand: If Tesla were to win the contract, Mr. Musk would appear in South Australia to announce it to the world.

“He usually doesn’t come for announcements of winning a tender,” Mr. Weatherill said, “but he said he’d come.”

Mr. Musk nearly broke his promise, after a rocket launch by his company SpaceX was delayed. But in September, Mr. Musk arrived in Adelaide to announce the $50 million deal and to start the 100-day countdown to the project’s completion.

“What this serves as is a great example to the rest of the world of what can be done,” Mr. Musk said at the time, adding that half the battery had already been finished.

Mr. Musk declined to be interviewed for this article.

In March, when Mr. Musk first presented his proposal, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke with the entrepreneur and tweeted enthusiastically about its potential.

Months later, when Tesla and the French renewables company Neoen were awarded the contract, however, Mr. Turnbull’s Liberal Party government assailed the battery project and continued its attack on South Australia’s energy policy.

“30,000 South Australian households could not get through watching one episode of ‘Australia’s Ninja Warrior’ with this big battery,” said Scott Morrison, the country’s treasurer.

Mr. Turnbull’s government has promoted fossil fuels over renewable energy to stimulate growth and prevent South Australia’s power shortages. The government has questioned the battery’s capacity, implied the state has been hoodwinked by a clever salesman and suggested that Mr. Weatherill was looking for publicity ahead of a 2018 election.

“The Tesla battery has been sold to the people of South Australia as an answer to their woes,” Josh Frydenberg, the energy minister, wrote in an email. “But in reality it is just a fraction of the storage and backup that South Australia needs.”

Franck Woitiez, the general manager of Neoen’s Australia division, which will operate the battery from its wind farm, said the Turnbull government was out of touch with the future of renewable energy.

“There’s no turning back,” said Mr. Woitiez. “It’s not tomorrow, it’s now.”

The next several weeks, the beginning of Australia’s summer, will be crucial for judging the battery’s success.

“Summer is when Australia gets its peak demand,” said Mr. Wood, the energy researcher. “It will be a very important and high-profile demonstration in the role that batteries can play.”

But some experts said the stakes would be even higher for Mr. Musk. He could shop the idea globally — if it works.

“He needs these battery packs to really become effective,” said Mr. Vance, Musk’s biographer. “He needs this to justify the entire reason of Tesla’s existence.”",Australia Powers Up the World’s Biggest Battery — Courtesy of Elon Musk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/world/australia/elon-musk-south-australia-battery.html

“To make the field grow and expand and have the procedure come out to more women, it has to be reproduced,” she said, adding that within hours of Baylor’s announcement, advocacy groups for women with uterine infertility from all over the world had contacted her to express their excitement at the news.

“It was a very exciting birth,” Dr. Johannesson said. “I’ve seen so many births and delivered so many babies, but this was a very special one.”

At Baylor, eight women have had transplants, including the new mother, in a clinical trial designed to include 10 patients. One recipient is pregnant, and two others — one of whom received her transplant from a deceased donor — are trying to conceive. Four other transplants failed after the surgery, and the organs had to be removed, said Dr. Giuliano Testa, principal investigator of the research project and surgical chief of abdominal transplantation.

“We had a very rough start, and then hit the right path,” Dr. Testa said in a telephone interview. “Who paid for it in a certain way were the first three women. I feel very thankful for their contribution, more so than I can express.”

Both Dr. Johannesson and Dr. Testa said that a large part of their motivation came from meeting patients and coming to understand how devastated they were to find out that they would not be able to have children.

Dr. Testa said: “I think many men will never understand this fully, to understand the desire of these women to be mothers. What moved all of us is to see the mother holding her baby, when she was told, ‘You will never have it.’”

The transplants are now experimental, with much of the cost covered by research funds. But they are expensive, and if they become part of medical practice, will probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is not clear that insurers will pay, and Dr. Testa acknowledged that many women who want the surgery will not be able to afford it.

Another hospital, the Cleveland Clinic, performed the first uterus transplant in the United States in February 2016, but it failed after two weeks because of an infection that caused life-threatening hemorrhage and required emergency surgery to remove the organ. The clinic halted its program for an extended period, but has restarted it and has patients awaiting transplants, a spokeswoman, Victoria Vinci, said.

The woman who gave birth at Baylor was the fourth to receive a transplant there, in September 2016.

The process is complicated and has considerable risks for both recipients and donors. Donors undergo a five-hour operation that is more complex and takes out more tissue than a standard hysterectomy to remove the uterus. The transplant surgery is also difficult, in some ways comparable to a liver transplant, Dr. Testa said.

Recipients face the risks of surgery and anti-rejection drugs for a transplant that they, unlike someone with heart or liver failure, do not need to save their lives. Their pregnancies are considered high-risk, and the babies have to be delivered by cesarean section to avoid putting too much strain on the transplanted uterus. So far all the births have occurred a bit earlier than the normal 40 weeks of gestation — at 32 to 36 weeks.

Women who have transplants cannot conceive the natural way, because their ovaries are not connected to the uterus, so there is no way for an egg to get in there. Instead, they need in vitro fertilization. Before the transplant, women are given hormone treatments to make their ovaries release multiple eggs, which are then harvested, fertilized and frozen.

Once the woman has fully recovered from surgery and begun menstruating, the eggs can be implanted in the uterus, one at a time, until she becomes pregnant.

In Sweden, doctors waited a year after the transplant before trying to start a pregnancy, to allow the women time to heal. At Baylor, the team moved much faster, and began trying to impregnate the women within a few months of the surgery, soon after they began menstruating.

Dr. Testa said it was his idea to start the pregnancies earlier, because the women were young and healthy, and did not need a year to bounce back from surgery. He argued that the waiting time just kept them on anti-rejection drugs — which have significant side effects — for longer than necessary.

“We went shorter,” he said. “I think we were right.”

He and Dr. Johannesson said the Swedish team, and other centers planning transplants, had also begun to consider shortening the wait.","Woman With Transplanted Uterus Gives Birth, the First in the U.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/health/uterus-transplant-baby.html

A few years ago, while poring over the countless images he had collected over the decades, he decided to use them in an installation that looks at how Puerto Rico — and Puerto Ricans — were portrayed by their colonial masters.
Long interested in museums — especially ethnographic ones — he was inspired to open his own: The Museum of the Old Colony, a movable installation comprising images, text and objects that has already been exhibited at New York University and will open in the coming weeks at the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art.
The phrase “Old Colony” is a play on words, referencing both the island’s political status and a popular local soft drink.
“Pablo Delano’s Museum of the Old Colony is a great contribution in questioning the veracity of ‘historic’ photos and the problem of how Puerto Rico was represented by American photographers starting with the military invasion of 1898,” said Marianne Ramirez-Aponte, the executive director and curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art.","The images from Puerto Rico show devastated landscapes, flooded streets and barefoot children. In some cases, they are accompanied by snide comments that tease or blame the subjects for their predicament. Are these from 2017, post-Hurricane Maria?

No, try 1899.

A year after the Treaty of Paris ended the Spanish-American War and the United States acquired Puerto Rico (along with Cuba and the Philippines), images from an illustrated census provide early insight to the nebulous, paternalistic and at times violent relationship between the United States and its island territory.

The photographer Pablo Delano has long collected images of Puerto Rico: In some ways, it is in his blood, since his father, Jack Delano, had gone to Puerto Rico in the 1940s as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration, then returned after World War II to work in film, television and photography, producing one of the most telling (and loving) looks at the island.

But these photos from 1899 appealed to him for different reasons. A few years ago, while poring over the countless images he had collected over the decades, he decided to use them in an installation that looks at how Puerto Rico — and Puerto Ricans — were portrayed by their colonial masters. Long interested in museums — especially ethnographic ones — he was inspired to open his own: The Museum of the Old Colony, a movable installation comprising images, text and objects that has already been exhibited at New York University and will open in the coming weeks at the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art.

“I was struck by how similar the 1899 pictures looked to the ones we’re seeing from Hurricane Maria,” said Mr. Delano, who teaches at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. “Some of the photos were even taken in the same towns and streets. It was difficult to look at because to me it suggested visually maybe we are back where we started. It raised the question: What has been the outcome of this century of occupation?”

Some answers were evident in the slow and spotty federal response to the hurricane, as well as President Trump’s postings on social media showing little empathy for the plight of some 3.4 million American citizens. To many on the island and its diaspora, the president’s remarks, the slow pace of recovery, even FEMA’s supplying of candy and snacks instead of healthier emergency rations, were sobering reminders of their second-class citizenship.

The phrase “Old Colony” is a play on words, referencing both the island’s political status and a popular local soft drink. While the show was conceived several years ago, its images and captions – which include misspelled place names and casual racist slurs – provide ample proof that the relationship between the island and American authorities has been unequal from the start.

The books and images Mr. Delano collected for decades portray Puerto Ricans as colonial subjects whose lives will be improved by the imposition of American values and, in 1917, American citizenship. They were done — mostly by outsiders — to introduce American readers to the people and places that were taken as the spoils of war, and often with a distinct, propagandistic point of view.

“People were generally portrayed as ignorant or stupid,” Mr. Delano said. “There was a very strong racialization that was very different from how race was thought of under the Spanish colonials.”

Dark-skinned workers and their families shown barefoot and in threadbare clothes are touted as “newly made Americans,” while six dark-skinned children sitting on a fallen palm street are called “pickaninnies.” One stereo card image shows two children in ragged, torn clothing as wearing “their Sunday Dress.” A white tourist child is shown drinking from a coconut using “a sanitary straw,” the implication being that she had to be protected from local contagion.

“Now in the context of Trump going to the island and making snide, condescending comments made me think of them in the context of some of the original captions,” he said. “If you read some of those original captions, they are identical to the tone and content of what Trump was saying. The boys in rags being described as ‘their Sunday Dress’: Who with any heart, with any compassion, would make fun of boys wearing rags? That was in 1899, yet we see a similar attitude coming from Trump when he goes there and throws paper towels at people.”

Other images, commissioned by the Puerto Rican government to mark 50 years since the American annexation, were boosterish, like one showing a local man riding a bike festooned with American flags. Even an image of schools is not of a college classroom or high school, but a school for maids being trained for domestic work in suburban New York.

Not surprisingly, there are images of American officers poring over a map of the island, and local police rounding up scores of Puerto Rican nationalists after a failed attempt to assassinate President Truman.

These images show the roots of the current predicament on an island whose people were to be lifted up by Americanization, only to go into free fall a century later thanks to a collapsing economy, a brain drain and $74 billion owed to American hedge funds that purchased Puerto Rican debt and are intent on collecting it.

That was before Hurricane Maria, which – like all natural disasters – exposed the weakness in the system and lack of emergency planning beforehand or the slow aid afterward. And while the installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art was in the works before the hurricane, the storm only made it more relevant and urgent.

“Pablo Delano’s Museum of the Old Colony is a great contribution in questioning the veracity of ‘historic’ photos and the problem of how Puerto Rico was represented by American photographers starting with the military invasion of 1898,” said Marianne Ramirez-Aponte, the executive director and curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art. “That foreign gaze, of the Other, we are confronting again today in light of the great interest internationally after the destruction suffered by Puerto Rico after the hurricanes, and the curiosity to understand our complex relationship to the United States; a relationship that determines the socioeconomic structures affecting practically all aspects of Puerto Rican lives.”

When asked of the show’s relevance, Mr. Delano, a man given to disarming humor, put on an affected announcer’s voice. “As history marches forward!” he intoned. “There seems to be a general acknowledgment by countries involved with colonialism, they must have had some sense that it was not just. More and more, former colonial powers are feeling some obligation to the places they colonized.

“But this place, where I was born, is still experiencing the ravages of colonialism.”

The new manager of the Yankees has a charming little parlor trick that just might help in the dugout. Show Aaron Boone almost any baseball card, and he can tell you where the photo was taken, simply from the background details. By extension — and more important — he knows precisely what the player is doing, too.

“He has a photographic memory of details, of physicality, of mechanics,” said Jim Bowden, who drafted Boone as general manager of the Cincinnati Reds. “It’s a really special trait. If something’s off, even a little bit, he’ll pick up on it immediately because his brain sees stuff that most brains don’t.”

Boone, 44, has not been officially announced as Joe Girardi’s successor with the Yankees. But General Manager Brian Cashman selected Boone from a pool of six candidates, and the managing general partner, Hal Steinbrenner, approved. Boone was an ESPN broadcaster with no coaching or managing experience, but his baseball lineage runs deep.

In 1980, at age 7, he rode in a parade float down Broad Street in Philadelphia, celebrating the Phillies’ World Series title. His father, Bob, was their catcher — an All-Star like his grandfather Ray Boone and his brother Bret. The boys were regulars around Veterans Stadium, and later in Anaheim after Bob joined the California Angels.

Before his last game with the Phillies, in the 1981 playoffs, Bob Boone did an interview with Tom Seaver on NBC. Seaver asked how he prepared that morning.

“A little different for me today, Tom,” he said. “I got here a little later than I normally do. I had to go out and watch my son play pee-wee football this morning. It was a really exciting game, a nip-and-tuck battle. They ended up losing, 7-0, but it was quite a game. It was a nice, relaxing morning for me.”

It was the kind of answer you could imagine Aaron giving now about his own sons — detailed, sincere and just a bit silly. The play-by-play man, Don Criqui, followed up by remarking on the Boone family.

“There’s never been three generations to make it to the major leagues,” he said, “but they say the Boones might well be the first.”

They were indeed, and Aaron embodies a bit of all of them, according to Hal McCoy, the longtime baseball writer for the Dayton Daily News, who grew up watching Ray Boone play for Cleveland and covered the other three.

“Ray was more of a stern guy, Bob was a cerebral guy, Bret was a tough guy,” McCoy said. “Aaron is a combination of all of them. That’s what makes him stand out. He can be cerebral and tough at the same time.”

The Reds drafted Boone from the University of Southern California in the third round in 1994, drawn by his athleticism, smarts and background. Boone could be fiery; he was ejected from his major league debut three years later for throwing his helmet after a play at the plate. But he was also a keen observer, thirsting for information despite a lifetime in the clubhouse.

“He always wants to know more about the global part of the game,” said Bowden, who now works for MLB Network Radio. “He was curious about the front office, the bullpen, the scouting room, the draft room — always curious about how things worked. He truly loved all aspects of the game.”

That extends to the people who cover it. Just before spring training in 2003, McCoy suffered strokes in both optic nerves. His sports editor sent him to spring training in Sarasota, Fla., and McCoy — nearly blind — struggled to recognize faces in the clubhouse. Boone pulled him aside and asked what was wrong. McCoy explained and said he was going to quit.

“He grabbed me by the elbow and sat me down,” McCoy said. “He said: ‘I don’t ever want to hear you say you’re giving up. You love what you do too much. Everybody in this clubhouse will help you.’ He was right.”

McCoy credits Boone’s kindness with saving his career. Naturally, Boone also ribbed McCoy, playfully — he once asked why he was talking to a Coke machine. But when Boone’s name appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot, he received only one vote: McCoy’s.

Meeting the demands of the news media, who meet twice a day with the manager, should go smoothly for Boone. In a market like New York, a manager without those skills would create unneeded distractions.

“He’ll be a Joe Torre type of guy — everybody’s going to love him,” McCoy said. “He was our go-to guy. If the Reds lost, he was at his seat after every game, answering questions. There were days when the clubhouse would be completely empty, except for Aaron. Even if he had nothing to do with the loss, he would be introspective and available.”

The Reds traded Boone to the Yankees in July 2003, and his homer won Game 7 of the American League Championship Series — a moment that turned out to be the final gasp of Yankees superiority over the rival Boston Red Sox. Boone’s off-season knee injury, sustained while he played basketball, cost him most of his $5.75 million contract and led the Yankees to trade for Alex Rodriguez.

Boone played five more seasons, with four teams. He finished with Houston in 2009, playing 10 games down the stretch without a hit. But it was a triumph because Boone — then just 36 — had undergone open-heart surgery in March to fix a problem with his aorta and aortic valve, a condition he had known about since college.

A year later, he was calling games for ESPN. He lives with his family in Arizona and voraciously follows his favorite football teams, U.S.C. and the Philadelphia Eagles. He imitated batting stances, pitching motions and other mannerisms on his broadcasts. He was an aggressive fantasy baseball owner in a SiriusXM league with hosts and callers; his team name, “Hum Baby,” was the catchphrase of Roger Craig, a San Francisco Giants manager popular with players.

Boone’s ability to connect, especially in a young Yankees clubhouse, was said to be critical to Cashman. Previous managing experience is hardly necessary anymore; 17 of the 30 major league managers, including Boone, are working in their first major league managing job. In some ways, Boone fits the modern profile — he is one of 26 current managers who attended college, and has recent playing experience.

“He has the swag of a player,” Bowden said. “That’s important with this generation. Very few have it, and you can’t fake it.”

Those relationships should help Boone sell players on the vision of the front office, which may be the manager’s most important task in the era of analytics. The Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who just met in the World Series, often used unconventional strategies based on data. Their managers, A. J. Hinch and Dave Roberts, got players to buy in.

“Joe Girardi had a great 10-year run, but what Brian did was look at the next 10 years,” Bowden said. “Joe was great for the last 10 years, like Joe Torre was great before him. But the game is changing at such a speed that you’ve got to be able to not only jump on and go with it, but relate it to this generation of young stars.”

Those stars may already know Boone’s most famous moment, which plays on the scoreboard before every game at Yankee Stadium: the knuckleball from Tim Wakefield, the deep fly ball into the left-field seats, the joyous throng at the plate.

All these years later, though, if you ask Boone what he remembers most about the homer, he’ll mention something different: As he floated around the bases, the Velcro came loose on his batting gloves. If you’re paying attention, you can notice the strap dangling off his wrist in every highlight.

To Boone, the details always matter. Now more than ever.

WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, removed a top F.B.I. agent this summer from his investigation into Russian election meddling after the Justice Department’s inspector general began examining whether the agent had sent text messages that expressed anti-Trump political views, according to three people briefed on the matter.

The agent, Peter Strzok, is considered one of the most experienced and trusted F.B.I. counterintelligence investigators. He helped lead the investigation into whether Hillary Clinton had mishandled classified information on her private email account, and then played a major role in the investigation into links between President Trump’s campaign and Russia.

But Mr. Strzok was reassigned this summer from Mr. Mueller’s investigation to the F.B.I.’s human resources department, where he has been stationed since. The people briefed on the case said the transfer followed the discovery of text messages in which Mr. Strzok and a colleague reacted to news events, like presidential debates, in ways that could appear critical of Mr. Trump.

“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the special counsel’s office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” said a spokesman for the special counsel’s office, Peter Carr.

The inspector general’s office at the Justice Department said that as part of a larger inquiry it was conducting into how the F.B.I. had handled investigations related to the 2016 election, the office was “reviewing allegations involving communications between certain individuals, and will report its findings regarding those allegations promptly upon completion of the review of them.”",Mueller Removed Top Agent in Russia Inquiry Over Possible Anti-Trump Texts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/mueller-removed-top-fbi-agent-over-possible-anti-trump-texts.html

“Whatever happens, it won’t be good.”Santiago joined the 18th Street gang in 1998, at 15.
These days, he said, the police staged fake gunfights just to kill gang members, then explained it away by calling them terrorists.
“We are the pretty girl that everyone wants to dance with right now,” Santiago told me.","When I met him, Santiago sat alone on the second floor of a crowded family restaurant in central San Salvador, sipping a bowl of soup. He wore jeans, work boots and a polo shirt that hid his tattoos. To passers-by, he looked like any other workingman enjoying his lunch.

“Tell me about terrorism,” Santiago said. He’d heard that I once worked in Afghanistan. “How do you define it?” El Salvador’s Supreme Court had declared the gangs to be terrorist groups, a move that seemed designed at least in part to draw aid from the United States. For more than an hour, while Santiago smoked cigarettes and drank beer mixed with lemon juice, we talked about terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. Santiago granted that the gangs of El Salvador were violent, but theirs was a violence of a different nature. “The only parallel I see is that we represent a certain community, a segment of society that has been marginalized,” he said. “But our violence is not ideological and certainly not religious.”

I asked him how the gangs represented anyone other than themselves. What services did they provide to the communities? The Taliban governed those under their control with laws that, while brutal, were often more consistently enforced than the government’s. The gangs, by comparison, were predators, killing shopkeepers for failing to pay bribes and battling rival gangs over issues of territory and respect that had nothing to do with the needs of the community.

Santiago nodded. “The question isn’t what services we provide,” he said. “The question is more fundamental: What does our existence say about the government and the services it fails to provide? We exist because there is nothing else.”

Like the F.M.L.N., the gangs of El Salvador were shaped by the long civil war that began in 1980. Back then, the F.M.L.N. was a constellation of leftist groups facing off against the right-wing government. As the battles became increasingly violent, hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans relocated to the United States, settling largely in Los Angeles, where their children organized to protect themselves from other poor minorities trapped on the outskirts of the American dream. By the time they were deported, years later, they had formed the very gangs gnawing at Salvadoran society — gangs that were notably brutal, known for severing the heads of enemies and utterly disregarding the fate of civilians caught in the crossfire. Now, as they had during the civil war, hundreds of thousands of refugees were fleeing, including more than 50,000 children under 18 who in recent years have attempted the 1,500-mile overland journey to the United States.

The original anti-gang mano dura was first employed by the Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, the right-wing party that first won the presidency in 1989. That ultimately served only to strengthen the resolve and coherence of the gangs. When the F.M.L.N. took power in 2009, it tried something different. It began working in secret to broker a truce between the nation’s warring gangs. The premise was simple: through trusted intermediaries, bring top leaders together in minimum-security prisons, allow them to interact and encourage them to forge a peace on the streets.

When this original truce finally fell into place in 2012, it almost immediately cut the national homicide rate roughly in half. But as it became public, questions surfaced: Were the gangs merely consolidating their positions before they unleashed another wave of violence? Were the leaders being given special treatment that included access to drugs and prostitutes? Was the government investing in a strategy in which the gangs could negotiate by killing more people? Once exposed, the truce never enjoyed much popularity among Salvadorans, and the United States fiercely opposed it. In 2014, the government began backing away from the effort, and the homicide rate began to climb significantly once again.

When Sánchez Cerén became president in June 2014, he cut off all government support for the effort and within seven months had sent the gang leadership back to maximum-security prisons, severing their lines of communication. One of the most peaceful periods since the civil war led to one of the most deadly, and not just because intragang warfare was on the rise. Police violence radically escalated, too, with authorities killing eight times as many suspected gang members in 2015 as they did in 2013. In a remarkable feat of reporting, journalists for the Salvadoran newspaper El Faro found that between January and August 2016, for every police officer that died in a gunfight, 53 suspected gang members were killed. In the history of modern war, combatants are far more likely to be injured than killed. But in El Salvador, during 1,074 firefights with alleged gang members in a 20-month period, the police killed 693 and injured only 255. The country’s vice president has publicly granted officers the right to use deadly force “without any fear of suffering consequences.”

What is happening is like a war in nearly every way, but the vocabulary of war has no words to describe this new variation. The gangs look something like an insurgency, but they appear to have no political aim other than to avoid being killed. The mere existence of would-be diplomats like Santiago reflects a new dynamic, once unthinkable, and at least a potential willingness in some corners to lay down arms. In December 2016, leaders of MS-13 told El Faro that they would be willing to sit down with the government, even placing the dismantling of the gang on the table if it achieved peace. Where before that option was out of the question, the leaders appear to have evolved in the wake of the truce. In February, they created the Gang Coordination Group for Dialogue. The group even reached out this year to a United Nations special envoy, asking him to initiate a dialogue between the gangs and the government.

The F.M.L.N. has so far failed to respond to these overtures, and so have many Salvadorans. A recent poll showed that 40 percent of Salvadoran adults approve of torture to combat the gangs, while nearly 35 percent endorse extrajudicial killings. The politicians are unpopular, but so are the gangs. In the neighborhood of Montreal de Mejicanos, a violent hilltop slum under the administration of MS-13, one resident told me that in her area, Finca Argentina, the gangs had killed a boy who refused to join, buried him in an anonymous grave and forbade his parents to retrieve the body. In Aguilares, I attended the funeral of a bus driver killed because his bosses refused to pay two different gangs for the same route. His brother told me the pain and anger were enough to make him want to join their rivals, but he would let the government kill them instead.

A gang in El Salvador makes in a year what a Mexican cartel might make in a week. MS-13, the nation’s largest gang, with 40,000 members, takes in about $30 million annually, collecting extortion payments of a few dollars, sometimes in coins, and distributing it in small handouts to its members who also live off whatever food they can strong-arm from local vendors. They seem uninterested in ideology. What power they have derives from their station as the only organized group present in El Salvador’s slums; the only family for Salvador’s tens of thousands of abandoned boys; and, for many, the only economy that exists.

Ultimately, Santiago said, the gangs would have to wait out the violence until the next round of elections. By Santiago’s estimate, the gangs could easily deliver 10 percent of the vote, a decisive portion in a two-party system. In March 2018, the nation will hold elections for municipal leaders and legislators, many in areas under gang control. The gangs could use their power to demand that Arena ease the mano dura if the party was elected, an act of retribution against the F.M.L.N. for taking such a hard-line against them. “The government will have to pay the bill for what they’ve done,” he said. “They will have to answer to us, in one way or another.”

Santiago seldom stayed anywhere more than a day at a time. Sometimes he would spend a night or two at the home of his ex-girlfriend, with whom he has a daughter, now 7. He also has a 5-year-old son with another woman. On rare occasions, he stayed with his grandmother. Other times, when he felt there was more heat, he stayed in rented houses that appeared, at least from the outside, to be abandoned.

His obsession with security was warranted: Marvin, his counterpart from MS-13, had been picked up in the middle of the night in his home. So had Nalo, the political commissioner for the 18th Street Revolutionaries. When we arrived at one of the empty houses one evening, Santiago pulled up in a driveway overgrown with weeds and idled for a minute, observing the scene. The house was dark: a single-story structure with curtains drawn against grated windows. Across the street, someone had installed a public-address system and hung a sign to transform a similar home into a church. The voices of evangelicals praising God drifted across the otherwise silent street. Satisfied that no one was outside, Santiago unchained the garage, threw open its rusted doors and drove inside.

The house looked only slightly better on the inside. The matted fabric of the living-room furniture was covered in cigarette burns. Spider webs filled the hallways. Santiago turned the water off the last time he left, and the toilets would not flush. He decided to wait for the service across the street to end before going outside to switch it back on. “I prefer if people don’t see me here,” he said.

Someone had mounted a new flat-screen TV to the cinder block wall. Santiago dropped onto the sofa and turned on the local news. He liked to keep track of political developments elsewhere in Latin America, he said.

As he flipped through channels, his cellphone rang. He answered, then listened quietly for a moment. “Do you want to file a complaint?” he asked finally. “I or someone else from the team can take you to the human rights office tomorrow, to fill out the paperwork.” He listened again, said he understood and hung up with a sigh.

It was the wife of one of the leaders, he said. Her husband had been imprisoned for years, and she hadn’t been allowed to talk to him in the months since the extraordinary measures went into effect. She said the police still harassed her, stopping by her home, breaking furniture, stealing valuables. She had thought about filing a complaint, but there were rumors that the prisons might begin allowing family visits again. If she filed a complaint, the police might not let her see her husband. In the end, she decided to drop it altogether.

Santiago liked his work, but it was growing harder. Most of his friends were dead or in jail, he said. A few made it to the United States and lived quiet lives with wives and kids. He sometimes thought he should follow them, but he feared discovery by American authorities. “I’m the last of my group that remains,” he said. “Whatever happens, it won’t be good.”

Santiago joined the 18th Street gang in 1998, at 15. His father, who had been a police officer, had left his family behind, making his way to the United States when Santiago was too young to remember, and Santiago as a young man had little ambition beyond, perhaps, moving his own life in a different direction. During the early years as an 18th Street member, he spent his days working in an upholstery shop while finishing his high-school degree at night. He supported his mother with money from odd jobs, but wanted something more. He liked being part of a community, he said, but otherwise it “had no purpose, it was just for the sake of it, just to be living the thug life.”

Slowly, the gangs began to formalize, issuing codes of conduct that prohibited attacks on fellow members and the use of hard drugs like crack. Santiago himself was a part of this evolution. Just before he graduated from high school, a founder of the 18th Street gang, Carlos Mojica, known as El Viejo Lin, invited him to a meal. Lin had turned his sights on developing 18th Street into something that more closely resembled organized crime. Santiago went to the meeting straight from school and was still wearing his uniform when they sat down. Lin smiled. “Continue studying as much as you can,” Santiago recalls him saying. “People like us need to find an interest, something to occupy our minds.” He gave Santiago a reading list that included the Salvadoran constitution and the Bible. “He told me that I should go to church,” Santiago recalled. “I thought he was crazy, but then he told me: ‘I’m not saying you should become a Christian, but trust me, you won’t find peace anywhere else.’ ” Santiago took his advice seriously, memorizing passages from the Bible and beginning to organize evangelical events. His was an odd gospel, one that combined Christian principles like unity and love with an acceptance of the violence and crime by which the gangs defined themselves.

That all changed in 2006, when Santiago was charged with attempted murder following a shootout with MS-13, even though he claims he played no part in it. After the government dropped the charges for lack of evidence, Santiago says, he decided that it was time to put an end to the criminal chapter of his life. He asked the leadership if he could focus his energies on finding channels for peace. They agreed.

Santiago never shared with me how, or what, he was paid for his work, but it couldn’t have been much. His daughter was supported by remittances from her mother’s relatives in the United States. The only lucrative stream of income they could have tapped, from the cartels that passed through their territory, was off-limits. I asked Santiago why the gangs, with all their manpower, never tried to tax the cartels. He laughed. “No way, man,” he said. With the government war on them, the gangs could hardly afford a fight with the cartels. “I have read a little about Hitler,” Santiago said. “He was caught out because he opened too many fronts.”

Santiago is a fast and energetic talker, and when he gets going — bouncing from China’s Communist government to Colombia’s peace process to Russia under Putin — he engages his arms and torso like a conductor, as if summoning his own best ideas. He once told me that in another life, he would have studied law, a profession more suited to his intellectual curiosity. But he also told me that he didn’t regret joining a gang, only that he hadn’t started his reform efforts sooner. Gang structures are cellular, and on a neighborhood level, they often operate independently of the broader leadership. Santiago knew most everyone, and he spent his days on the phone with his rivals and sometimes met them in person. They shared details of the latest death by the hand of a rival or the police. They discussed coming meetings with church or nongovernmental leaders. They planned joint communiqués and kept open the lines of communication to avoid any setbacks in the cease-fire.

He pondered whether he would have joined the gang if he had grown up under different circumstances. While many gang members blame the government for breaking the first truce, for Santiago the failure was simpler than that. The truce improved the lives of gang members, who were dying in fewer numbers, and of the government, which could take credit for the lower homicide stats. But average Salvadorans didn’t see much improvement in their lives. Extortion continued, as did the murder of innocents. Santiago said that continuing to demand money from civilians had been the central mistake of the truce; why it had been destined to fail.

“It’s really sad to reach this conclusion,” he told me earlier. “We understood this maybe 24 months after the truce began, but it was too late. We should’ve started there.”

I asked Santiago if he would ever allow his son to join a gang. “My son is the most outgoing kid you’ll ever meet,” he said, allowing himself a smile. “He shakes your hand, asks your name and wants to tell you all about his school. If he wanted to join a gang, it would be more than 10 years from now. By that time, I hope this dynamic of violence will have changed; if not, no one will want anything to do with it.”

More than 22,000 police officers are responsible for security in El Salvador, and they are now working alongside about 14,000 soldiers. Rather than the armed forces becoming more like a domestic police force, though, the police have become more like military occupiers. Early one evening, I accompanied the police on a patrol through Soyapango, a dense municipality of 300,000 consisting of low-slung homes and corrugated shacks to the east of the capital. It is considered one of the most dangerous places in the country. As we drove down a narrow avenue packed with pedestrians, we passed a man carrying a woman, unconscious, across the street, his face fixed in panic. He neither stopped the police to ask for help, nor did they offer any.

The captain and a driver picked up three young officers from the sidewalk of the central square: well-groomed, well-built 27-year-old graduates of the same class at the police academy. We eased out of the dense streets of central Soyapango toward a neighborhood called Horizontes, in the thick of MS-13 territory. Even in the generally dilapidated state of San Salvador, there was a noticeable increase in the general disrepair. The streets were crushed into rubble, empty lots were overgrown and abandoned, most of the houses were made of cinder block, without so much as a coat of paint or plaster. Trash filled the open spaces like wild grass.

The plan, such as it was, involved searching a nearby “destroyer house,” slang for a hide-out, this one in Horizontes, where they believed some MS-13 members might be seeking refuge after a firefight with the police. In reality, the mission was simpler than that: a “presence patrol,” to show they could come and go as they wished in enemy territory, a reminder to the gangs, or anyone who helped them, that the government would not sit idle. One officer told me that he and his fellow officers had killed five gang members in a firefight two weeks earlier, in the exact spot where we walked. He pointed to a sewage pipe emerging from a storm drain. “One of them died there,” he said, adjusting his assault rifle. The survivors had run, he said, but the police had come to believe that the gang members were hiding in the destroyer house.

Stripped of paint, its windows sealed with boards, the home looked abandoned. An officer nicknamed Chino, because his fellow officers thought his light skin and almond eyes made him look Chinese, banged on the door. When no one responded, he knocked out the front window board. To our surprise, a young man wearing only boxers stepped into the living room, his hands raised. Chino leapt through the window cavity and took aim at him. “Get down,” he yelled. “What are you doing here?”

The young man dropped to his knees. “I live here,” he replied, looking up slightly.

“That’s a lie,” the cop responded. “You’re hiding out.”

A foam mattress with a soiled, twisted sheet lay in the center of the room. A badly torn sofa, its coils exposed through faded velvet, was pressed against a wall. Chino asked the man how long he’d been in the gang. “I’m not involved in anything,” he replied. “I sell tomatoes in the central market. I live with my girlfriend here. She’s pregnant with our second kid.”

Chino told him to lie flat and then placed the tip of his boot beneath the young man’s chin and lightly lifted his face, now looking him directly in the eye. “I don’t believe your wife lives here,” he said. “Like this.”

Another officer came in from the backyard; he was clutching a police belt with the holster attached. “Did you take this from a police officer?” Chino demanded, tossing the belt on the mattress pad.

The boy began to plead. “No way, you guys would kill me,” he said, shaking his head. “Imagine me doing something like that, with two kids.” The cops stepped outside to call in the apparent theft of the belt. From the other end, they received orders to leave the boy alone. Because he was 17 and thus underage, he was not worth the trouble.

Past the house, we came upon a shooting range used by the gangs. A few crude human silhouettes were spray-painted on a cinder-block wall, with crooked circles drawn over their hearts. The concrete was pocked with bullet holes. On an adjoining wall, someone had scrawled the words Ver, Oír y Callar, a gang refrain across El Salvador: See, hear and be silent.

We walked to Valle de las Delicias, a neighborhood a few blocks over. Giant blue-and-black murals covered the backs of buildings, memorials to fallen leaders that, despite the surrounding decay, were remarkably well maintained. As we snaked through an alley, we came upon another young man, slender with curly hair and acne scars covering his face, who was talking to someone on a candy-bar-style cellphone that hailed from the 1990s. An officer snatched the phone away, tossed it to a colleague and began to frisk the man roughly.

“I didn’t do anything,” he said, resisting the manhandling. The boy’s parents raced onto their porch.

“He didn’t do anything, why are you harassing him?” the father, who was smaller than his son and wore a yellowed tank top, demanded. The officer pressed down on the boy’s neck until he was nearly bent over. He asked his colleagues for a camera to register him. “He’s got no record of any crimes, why are you placing him in the system?” the father asked.

“Shut up or I’ll register you next,” the officer snapped.

The cops left the family seething on their porch. “Look at how they abuse him, just because he is young,” the father told me. “I don’t understand how they can live with themselves. They have kids, too. How would they like it if someone did this to their kids?”

At the end of the patrol, we walked to the edge of the neighborhood, marked by a giant ceiba tree that soared some 150 feet above a parking lot at the edge of a fallow field. The officer who had registered the boy asked me what the family had said to me. I told him. He paused to reflect.

“In these marginalized communities, every family has at least one person involved with the gangs,” he said. “Of course I’m sad about this. I’m sad about the poverty, I feel sorry for these families, those involved in the gangs, but especially the innocents who die.” A police truck idled beneath the tree’s broad canopy. The officers got in, one by one.

“All of this is about poverty and marginalization,” he said, nodding at a trash bin near the tree’s sprawling roots, where the words “[Expletive] Police” were written in English.

Santiago was often lonely in his work. Gang life revolved around crime, not peace, so he remained on the fringe. Until last year, his community included an informal group of a few high-ranking religious leaders, diplomats and the gang commission. They met to discuss strategies to reinitiate the truce or at the very least to keep open the lines of communication.

With the pressure brought by the extraordinary measures, the meetings had all but ceased. Santiago still tried to communicate with the members of the group, and occasionally, he would visit one. And so, on a Saturday afternoon in October, he drove to the Lutheran church offices to catch up with the bishop, Medardo Gómez.

“May I help you, sir?” the receptionist asked, eyeing Santiago as he loitered in front of her desk.

“I’m here to see the bishop,” Santiago said with a broad smile.

“He’s in the middle of a meeting right now,” she said, staring at her computer.

Santiago took a seat and waited. It was nearly noon, and a small crowd sat outside the bishop’s office. Most were dressed in formal attire. Santiago wore a collared shirt, jeans and a pair of Nike running shoes that a friend had given him. After a few minutes, an older woman with a pressed suit and fine jewelry walked into the lobby. She stopped when she saw Santiago in the waiting room.

“Oh, my God, it’s you,” she said, racing toward him and giving him a hug. “Does he know you’re here?” she asked, nodding toward the bishop’s door. “We haven’t seen you in months,” she continued excitedly. “How are things? We heard about Alex,” she said, referring to a member of the political committee from the 18th Street Revolutionaries who had been arrested. “This situation is just horrible right now. You’re the first person I’ve seen in months.”

She ushered him to the bishop’s door and presented him. The bishop, an elderly man with rheumy eyes, sat at the head of a modest conference table, hosting a small gathering. The crowd dissipated when Santiago entered, and the bishop stood to greet him. “It’s good to see you here, I wasn’t sure if you had been grabbed, too,” he said, placing his mottled hand on top of Santiago’s. “I told Alex he needed to make routine changes. But they caught him at home, at dawn.”

“Thank God they didn’t do anything else to him,” Santiago said.

Like Santiago, Alex was a part of the political committee from the beginning, ever since the truce was first announced. Now he was locked up for murder, the bishop said.

“I’ve been told that there are testimonies saying it wasn’t him,” the bishop continued, staring at the table as if talking to no one in particular, “Maybe they will prove it.” He turned to face Santiago, who was looking at the vast collection of photos on the bishop’s desk and walls. “It seems that you are the only survivor.”

Marvin, Santiago’s counterpart within MS-13, was in prison and suspected to be cooperating with the authorities under a plea agreement. Nalo, a top leader of the 18th Street Revolutionaries, whose real name is Carlos Eduardo Burgos Nuila, was too. Alex, meanwhile, was imprisoned but, so far as anyone knew, had signed no such deal. Though the gangs had moved swiftly to replace them and resume communications with the rest of the committee, the bonds were new and untested.

Santiago asked the bishop how things had been going with the other members of the informal group — the diplomats, nongovernmental workers and church leaders. The receptionist entered with the bishop’s lunch, a watery bowl of stew. The bishop looked down at it with disappointment.

The bishop said he was planning a forum to bring together local leaders and government officials to talk about the extraordinary measures, specifically the impact the violence was having in neighborhoods. He lifted the bowl to his lips and drank, then picked at a tough-looking piece of short rib before giving up. “We must insist on dialogue and push forward at all levels,” he said. “We don’t have to see it only as a dialogue with gangs, but we want to integrate, boost dialogue, with everyone.”

The bishop held a faint hope that by bringing residents of the affected areas out to speak with officials, they would hear stories about the misery their policy had wrought. “The measures have made matters worse instead of being helpful,” he said. “The idea of a forum is to say, both nationally and internationally, ‘Look, the extraordinary measures here are not working.’ ” He paused and sighed. “We can’t deny the death toll has decreased,” he continued. “But the way the police are behaving now, they have stopped being agents of safety. Now they are agents of death.”

Santiago grew animated. To hear a respected church leader echo his feelings had brought him to something like catharsis. These days, he said, the police staged fake gunfights just to kill gang members, then explained it away by calling them terrorists. “Do I look like a terrorist?” he asked the bishop.

The bishop shook his head and pushed his chair back from the table. There were heavy bags under his eyes, and he was running late for a meeting in another part of town. He looked at Santiago. “No, it’s clear to me that they have just said this to justify repression and request international assistance,” he said.

Santiago saw the bishop off, then lit a cigarette in the building’s courtyard, beside a dormant fountain overrun with foliage. “These chats give me strength; they tell me that I’m not alone,” he said, flicking his ash into an empty bucket. “That at least someone thinks like I do.”

Last summer, things began to unravel for Santiago. The government campaign against the gangs continued, and the truce — though still in effect — was fraying, its future in question. In August, prosecutors took 18 non-gang members involved in creating the original 2012 truce, mostly low-level functionaries and government officials, to trial on charges of criminal conspiracy and smuggling banned goods into prisons.

Santiago watched the trial on television. Marvin and Nalo, two of his gang counterparts, had in fact turned state’s witnesses after their incarceration. Nalo was the star witness during the trial. He testified that gang members were given fried-chicken dinners and flat-screen TVs for their willingness to reduce the homicide rate but also described the cash dealings they had with both major political parties ahead of the 2014 presidential election, which included more than $250,000 in payments for their support. Still, no politicians were charged or even asked to testify, neither were the intellectual authors of the truce, including the current defense minister. Eventually, all the defendants were acquitted and the judge called out the prosecutors for charging individuals who were merely acting on government orders. Unbowed by their defeat in court, the government quickly appealed the judge’s ruling and brought a new round of charges, this time accusing individuals involved in the 2012 truce of extortion. But it hardly mattered. The government’s mano dura had broken the gangs’ political commission apart. Though the truce still held among the gangs, it was as much about self-preservation in the face of government aggression as it was about creating peace.

Though Santiago felt sorry for his former compatriots, he mostly felt devastated that years of work — building alliances and trust in civil society, forging relationships with rivals, selling the vision on the streets — had been turned into a public spectacle. But he had his own problems to worry about. By the end of August, even before the defendants were found not guilty, he was already preparing to flee the country.

Santiago knew there would be no reprieve, at least not until the 2018 elections. Well before the trial, Santiago wrote a manifesto for the gangs. For the first time in decades, they would not support the F.M.L.N. at the polls. They would instead use their political might to swing the elections away from them, whether to the right-wing party or, potentially, third-party candidates. The quid pro quo had always been support — in return for money — for the F.M.L.N. But President Sánchez Cerén of the F.M.L.N. had broken its longstanding relationship with the gangs by waging war against them. So the gangs would respond by wielding their 10 percent of the vote to punish them in the Legislature. The approaches from political parties had already started: politicians seeking access, favors, votes ahead of next year’s election. “We are the pretty girl that everyone wants to dance with right now,” Santiago told me.

But they would do so without Santiago. The authorities had found him. This February, months before the trial started, he was pulled over for a routine traffic stop after another meeting with Bishop Gómez. The police ran his car and identification, then let him go. But Santiago was suspicious. He sent his car to a specialist who found a GPS tracking device stuck to the chassis. Santiago switched vehicles.

In April, shortly after Easter, the police stopped him again. This time they charged him with resisting arrest and placed him in detention. After four days, two prosecutors and a police investigator came with an offer. The truce trial was a few months away and Santiago could testify against his former compatriots or he could go to jail for the rest of his life, on possible charges of gun trafficking, electoral fraud and smuggling contraband into jails. After making the offer, the authorities were forced to let him go — they had no grounds to hold him.

But he knew they would arrest him again, and he would be faced with the same dilemma. He didn’t want to snitch and undermine what he genuinely believed was the only way out of the cycle of violence consuming El Salvador. It would be turning his back on everything he’d worked for and all those he had tried to convince. At the same time, with the prisons teeming with disease and overpopulation, he couldn’t imagine being consigned to a shared cell for the rest of his life. He was only 34. He decided to flee.

When we last spoke, he would not tell me where he was, only that he had no plans to return to El Salvador, at least not for the next year or so. He was no longer the optimist of even six months earlier. The F.M.L.N. would lose the presidential election in 2019. And his people, the gangs and their community, would ensure they had a tough time in next year’s legislative and municipal elections. But in the meantime, he could do nothing to further the cause of dialogue. For now, that effort was broken.

“Right now, I’m a bit more of a realist,” he said. “I could argue that no matter which party wins, they are not going to look for an alternative.” The civil war took years and tens of thousands of deaths to push both sides to negotiate. So, too, would this war. Wars only end when someone wins or when both sides grow tired of the killing. “The violence has to reach a much higher level than where it is now to force that reckoning,” he said. “Only then will people start thinking about an integrated solution. The truth is, the country has to bleed more.”",‘They Will Have to Answer to Us’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/magazine/el-salvador-police-battle-gangs.html

Happy holidays! In the spirit of the season, here’s a suggestion: Instead of inflicting a garish tie on your brother or a carcinogenic face cream on your aunt, how about saving a life?

It’s time for my annual “gifts with meaning” guide, with suggestions for presents that won’t just clog a chest of drawers. Consider a $20 flock of ducks to an impoverished Bangladeshi family through Heifer International, or a $143 CARE scholarship for a girl in a developing country to attend high school. Or some other ideas you may not have thought of:

Deworm a child. Or a village of children! One-quarter of people worldwide have worms in their bellies, impairing their nutrition and often leaving them anemic. Children can be dewormed for about 50 cents each, and this leads them to miss less school and earn more as adults. Kids in the American South were dewormed 100 years ago by the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, leading to large gains in school enrollment and in literacy, and now we can easily and cheaply achieve the same gains worldwide.

An excellent website called Givewell.org rigorously examines which charitable causes get the most bang for the buck (I strongly recommend browsing the site), and it recommends several deworming organizations. My favorite (yes, I have a favorite dewormer) is Deworm the World.

Pull a tooth! Millions of Americans can’t afford health or dental insurance, and a lifeline comes from volunteer doctors and dentists working through Remote Area Medical, an aid group that holds huge health fairs for those with no other access to help. During my visit to a fair in Virginia, I watched as one 30-year-old man had 18 teeth pulled.

Some uninsured families camped out for three days for a chance to see a doctor or dentist, and people had tears in their eyes as they thanked Stan Brock, the group’s founder. Some children walked out with new glasses and could see for the first time. Remote Area Medical doesn’t solve the systemic health care problems, but for those who have suffered an agonizing toothache for months or years, a dentist makes a life-changing difference — and since the doctors, dentists and nurses donate their time, it’s very cost-effective.","For the Holidays, Pull a Tooth or Save a Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-annual-gift-guide.html

“The Shape of Water” is partly a code-scrambled fairy tale, partly a genetically modified monster movie, and altogether wonderful. Guillermo del Toro, the writer and director, is a passionate genre geek. Sometimes his enthusiasm can get the better of his discipline, producing misshapen (but never completely uninteresting) movies like “Pacific Rim” and “Crimson Peak.” At his best, though — in “The Devil’s Backbone,” “Pan’s Labyrinth” and now, at last, again — he fuses a fan’s ardor with a romantic sensibility that is startling in its sincerity. He draws on old movies, comic books, mythic archetypes and his own restless visual imagination to create movies that seem less made than discovered, as if he had plucked them from the cultural ether and given them color, voice and form.

The most obvious reference point for “The Shape of Water” is “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” a Cold War-era camp-horror classic about a strange beast, quasi-fish and sort-of human, discovered in the rain forests of the Amazon. In Mr. del Toro’s update, such a creature is brought to Baltimore in the early 1960s and kept in a tank at a government research lab, where he is subjected to brutal torture in the name of science and national security.

“The Asset,” as his minders call him, poses no threat to anyone. He is, as wild things tend to be in movies nowadays, an innocent at the mercy of a ruthlessly predatory species, which is to say us. His particular nemesis is Richard Strickland, a government-issue, square-jawed square played with reliable menace by Michael Shannon. Strickland lives in a suburban split-level with his wife and two kids, drives a Cadillac, reads “The Power of Positive Thinking” and is into mechanical missionary sex (and workplace sexual harassment). His favorite accessory is an electric cattle prod, a detail that links him to the Southern sheriffs occasionally shown terrorizing civil rights demonstrators on television.

A caricature? Maybe. But also a perfectly plausible villain, and in his diabolical all-American normalcy a necessary foil for the film’s loose rebel coalition, a band of misfits who come to the Asset’s defense. The most important of these is Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a member of the laboratory’s nighttime cleaning staff, who plays jazz records for the piscine captive, feeds him hard-boiled eggs and before long falls in love with him.

WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out at the F.B.I. on Sunday, defending himself after the guilty plea by his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, by charging that the bureau’s reputation was “in tatters — worst in history” and denying that he had told his first F.B.I. director to end the Flynn investigation.

James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testified before Congress in May that Mr. Trump had asked him to drop the inquiry into Mr. Flynn one day after Mr. Trump had fired Mr. Flynn. Mr. Comey declined to do so, and the president fired him several months later.

In a 6:15 a.m. tweet on Sunday, the president called Mr. Comey a liar and said the news media had spread falsehoods.

A few years ago, while poring over the countless images he had collected over the decades, he decided to use them in an installation that looks at how Puerto Rico — and Puerto Ricans — were portrayed by their colonial masters.
Long interested in museums — especially ethnographic ones — he was inspired to open his own: The Museum of the Old Colony, a movable installation comprising images, text and objects that has already been exhibited at New York University and will open in the coming weeks at the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art.
The phrase “Old Colony” is a play on words, referencing both the island’s political status and a popular local soft drink.
“Pablo Delano’s Museum of the Old Colony is a great contribution in questioning the veracity of ‘historic’ photos and the problem of how Puerto Rico was represented by American photographers starting with the military invasion of 1898,” said Marianne Ramirez-Aponte, the executive director and curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art.","The images from Puerto Rico show devastated landscapes, flooded streets and barefoot children. In some cases, they are accompanied by snide comments that tease or blame the subjects for their predicament. Are these from 2017, post-Hurricane Maria?

No, try 1899.

A year after the Treaty of Paris ended the Spanish-American War and the United States acquired Puerto Rico (along with Cuba and the Philippines), images from an illustrated census provide early insight to the nebulous, paternalistic and at times violent relationship between the United States and its island territory.

The photographer Pablo Delano has long collected images of Puerto Rico: In some ways, it is in his blood, since his father, Jack Delano, had gone to Puerto Rico in the 1940s as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration, then returned after World War II to work in film, television and photography, producing one of the most telling (and loving) looks at the island.

But these photos from 1899 appealed to him for different reasons. A few years ago, while poring over the countless images he had collected over the decades, he decided to use them in an installation that looks at how Puerto Rico — and Puerto Ricans — were portrayed by their colonial masters. Long interested in museums — especially ethnographic ones — he was inspired to open his own: The Museum of the Old Colony, a movable installation comprising images, text and objects that has already been exhibited at New York University and will open in the coming weeks at the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art.

“I was struck by how similar the 1899 pictures looked to the ones we’re seeing from Hurricane Maria,” said Mr. Delano, who teaches at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. “Some of the photos were even taken in the same towns and streets. It was difficult to look at because to me it suggested visually maybe we are back where we started. It raised the question: What has been the outcome of this century of occupation?”

Some answers were evident in the slow and spotty federal response to the hurricane, as well as President Trump’s postings on social media showing little empathy for the plight of some 3.4 million American citizens. To many on the island and its diaspora, the president’s remarks, the slow pace of recovery, even FEMA’s supplying of candy and snacks instead of healthier emergency rations, were sobering reminders of their second-class citizenship.

The phrase “Old Colony” is a play on words, referencing both the island’s political status and a popular local soft drink. While the show was conceived several years ago, its images and captions – which include misspelled place names and casual racist slurs – provide ample proof that the relationship between the island and American authorities has been unequal from the start.

The books and images Mr. Delano collected for decades portray Puerto Ricans as colonial subjects whose lives will be improved by the imposition of American values and, in 1917, American citizenship. They were done — mostly by outsiders — to introduce American readers to the people and places that were taken as the spoils of war, and often with a distinct, propagandistic point of view.

“People were generally portrayed as ignorant or stupid,” Mr. Delano said. “There was a very strong racialization that was very different from how race was thought of under the Spanish colonials.”

Dark-skinned workers and their families shown barefoot and in threadbare clothes are touted as “newly made Americans,” while six dark-skinned children sitting on a fallen palm street are called “pickaninnies.” One stereo card image shows two children in ragged, torn clothing as wearing “their Sunday Dress.” A white tourist child is shown drinking from a coconut using “a sanitary straw,” the implication being that she had to be protected from local contagion.

“Now in the context of Trump going to the island and making snide, condescending comments made me think of them in the context of some of the original captions,” he said. “If you read some of those original captions, they are identical to the tone and content of what Trump was saying. The boys in rags being described as ‘their Sunday Dress’: Who with any heart, with any compassion, would make fun of boys wearing rags? That was in 1899, yet we see a similar attitude coming from Trump when he goes there and throws paper towels at people.”

Other images, commissioned by the Puerto Rican government to mark 50 years since the American annexation, were boosterish, like one showing a local man riding a bike festooned with American flags. Even an image of schools is not of a college classroom or high school, but a school for maids being trained for domestic work in suburban New York.

Not surprisingly, there are images of American officers poring over a map of the island, and local police rounding up scores of Puerto Rican nationalists after a failed attempt to assassinate President Truman.

These images show the roots of the current predicament on an island whose people were to be lifted up by Americanization, only to go into free fall a century later thanks to a collapsing economy, a brain drain and $74 billion owed to American hedge funds that purchased Puerto Rican debt and are intent on collecting it.

Photo

That was before Hurricane Maria, which – like all natural disasters – exposed the weakness in the system and lack of emergency planning beforehand or the slow aid afterward. And while the installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art was in the works before the hurricane, the storm only made it more relevant and urgent.

“Pablo Delano’s Museum of the Old Colony is a great contribution in questioning the veracity of ‘historic’ photos and the problem of how Puerto Rico was represented by American photographers starting with the military invasion of 1898,” said Marianne Ramirez-Aponte, the executive director and curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art. “That foreign gaze, of the Other, we are confronting again today in light of the great interest internationally after the destruction suffered by Puerto Rico after the hurricanes, and the curiosity to understand our complex relationship to the United States; a relationship that determines the socioeconomic structures affecting practically all aspects of Puerto Rican lives.”

When asked of the show’s relevance, Mr. Delano, a man given to disarming humor, put on an affected announcer’s voice. “As history marches forward!” he intoned. “There seems to be a general acknowledgment by countries involved with colonialism, they must have had some sense that it was not just. More and more, former colonial powers are feeling some obligation to the places they colonized.

“But this place, where I was born, is still experiencing the ravages of colonialism.”

In addition to writing music, Mr. Mayer sometimes wrote about music.
Mr. Mayer suggested a wordless hug, or a wave and mimed applause.","Mr. Mayer also had to his credit a number of works for children. Perhaps the best known is “Hello, World!,” a musical tour of the world with text by Susan Otto in which voyagers learn how to say “Hello” in an assortment of languages. On a 1959 RCA Victor recording by the Little Orchestra Society, the narration was provided by a voice familiar to millions of radio listeners. The reader was Eleanor Roosevelt.

William Robert Mayer was born on Nov. 18, 1925, in Manhattan. His father, John, worked in finance but was also an amateur violinist. His mother, the former Dorothy Ehrich, a writer, died when he was 11.

At 15 he attended the Taft School in Connecticut, and in 1944 he entered Yale. He finished two semesters before being drafted into the Army, eventually receiving counterintelligence training and serving in American-occupied Japan.

After his military service he returned to Yale and graduated in 1948 with a history degree. He then embarked on a different path, enrolling at the Mannes College of Music, where his teachers included the music theorist Felix Salzer and the composer Roger Sessions.

Mr. Mayer’s early output was quite a mixture. It included many of his works for children, among them “Bongo and His Baboon Drum,” another setting of text by Ms. Otto, which told the story of a boy whose drum is swallowed by a baboon. Burl Ives recorded it in 1954, releasing it as a 78 r.p.m. record, and included it on his children’s album “Capt. Burl Ives’ Ark.”

Mr. Mayer also experimented with musical-theater-style songs. Some of these were performed more than three decades later in Manhattan at a Merkin Concert Hall celebration of Mr. Mayer’s 60th birthday, prompting John Rockwell to write in The Times, “One wondered whether Mr. Mayer might not have made an even greater success had he turned in Stephen Sondheim’s direction, way back then.”

His more serious compositions were also drawing attention and soon dominated his résumé. In 1960, Eric Salzman, then a music critic for The Times and soon to become a noted composer in his own right, reviewed a Carnegie Hall concert in which Mr. Mayer’s “Piano Sonata,” he wrote, was “by far the most striking and inventive piece on the program, with its interesting chromatic textures, carefully shaped harmonic sounds and rhythmic variety.” (Mr. Salzman died on Nov. 12.)

Mr. Mayer‘s other piano works included “Abandoned Bells” (1982), of which Piano Quarterly said, “Pianists should bless its publication.”

He also wrote numerous works for small, sometimes quirky groupings, like “Enter Ariel” (1980), a piece for piano, clarinet and voice that Mr. Page, in The Times, described as an “eloquent, imagistic song cycle.”

His orchestral works included the piano concerto “Octagon,” which was performed at Carnegie Hall in 1971 with Leopold Stowkowski conducting.

Some of his works were direct responses to serious times, like “Letters Home,” a setting of letters from servicemen in Vietnam. It was given its premiere at Carnegie Hall in May 1968 as part of a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had been assassinated the month before.

Mr. Mayer sometimes found himself at odds with compositional trends, preferring the harmonics of tonal music at a time when the dissonance of atonality was in vogue.

“To be a tonal composer in the ’60s and ’70s was a deeply dispiriting experience,” he once wrote. “One was shunned as the last teenaged virgin.”

Mr. Mayer married Meredith Nevins, a daughter of the historian Allan Nevins, in 1950. They raised three children in a home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx that had four pianos, Jane Mayer said, one of them in an upstairs studio, where Mr. Mayer did most of his composing.

“The three children were told to play quietly and not disturb the strange ‘plunks’ and ‘plinks’ that could be heard coming from behind the closed door,” she said by email. “He would emerge only for cups of coffee, and an occasional sandwich.”

In addition to Ms. Mayer, a staff writer for The New Yorker, Mr. Mayer is survived by his wife; his son, Steven, an accomplished pianist who has frequently played his father’s works; another daughter, Cynthia Mayer, who works in finance; a sister, Jane Field; and three grandchildren.

In addition to writing music, Mr. Mayer sometimes wrote about music. In an article in 1975 for The Times, “Live Composers, Dead Audiences,” he pondered the difficulties that the visual, instant-gratification age presented for modern composers, whose works take time and repeated listenings to appreciate.

“With television, we have become dependent on the visual,” he wrote. “But in listening to music, what do we do with our eyes? In TV, everything is there, explicit. Certain shows are doubly explicit: We see a comic routine and canned laughter reminds us it’s funny. But in hearing unfamiliar music, our voyage — if we make one at all — is uncharted.”

Other articles were far less serious. In “Good Friend, Bad Piece,” he offered cheeky advice on what to say when, after hearing a wretched new work, one encounters the composer friend who wrote it. Mr. Mayer suggested a wordless hug, or a wave and mimed applause. If words must be said, he offered “one-liners — all equivocal — that must be followed by immediate exit.”

“I’ve never heard anything like it!” is one.

“It evoked so many emotions!” is another.","William Mayer, Wide-Ranging Composer, Is Dead at 91",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/obituaries/william-mayer-wide-ranging-composer-dies-at-91.html

The federal government will run out of money and close its doors this month unless Congress can agree on a new spending bill. That’s one of several important pieces of business, albeit the most pressing, left unfinished during Republicans’ frantic drive to complete a tax bill.

Here are some others.

■ Nine million children covered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, have been waiting since Sept. 30 for Congress to renew the program. States are struggling to keep the program afloat; on Monday Colorado began sending letters to the families of 75,000 children and pregnant women, warning them that after Jan. 31 they’re on their own.

■ About 700,000 young people born to undocumented immigrants and at risk of deportation await a legislative alternative to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which, thanks to President Trump, is scheduled to end in March.

■ Victims of Western wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria are still waiting for tens of billions of dollars in additional federal aid promised weeks ago.

A lawyer representing Mr. Jadlowski did not respond to a phone message and an email seeking comment on Saturday.

The authorities said they responded to a call about a hunting-related shooting around 5:20 p.m. on the day before Thanksgiving. They said Mr. Jadlowski shot a high-velocity round from a pistol after sunset — when big-game hunting is not allowed.

“I hope this sends a loud and clear message that illegal hunting after sunset is dangerous and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” said Basil Seggos, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation.

Mr. Jadlowski reported hearing a scream, finding Ms. Billquist and calling 911 after firing the shot, the authorities said. Fire Department personnel discovered Ms. Billquist unresponsive about 150 yards from her home, and she died in a Pennsylvania hospital. Several hundred people attended her funeral on Wednesday, The Buffalo News reported.

Ms. Billquist’s husband, Jamie, who had been home at the time of the shooting, did not immediately reply to a phone message or email from The New York Times on Saturday.

But after the charges were announced, Mr. Billquist told The News that he found the developments to be positive, adding that he felt “confident that justice will be served.”

In a previous interview with The Times, Mr. Billquist said his wife was an avid marathon runner who volunteered at a local hospice. She also installed a bench outside the hospital where she worked so frail patients would not need to stand while waiting for rides.

Touch can bring people back to us — my father giving me a bear hug, my mother rubbing her hand over my whiskery cheek, my grandfather bouncing me as a 2-year-old on his belly. For all the epic impact of loved ones on our lives, sometimes gestures as simple as a home haircut make them feel present again.

I’d know my sister in a half-second by the pressure of her hand on my scalp, turning me just a little, situating me to edge the hair off my collar. When not in the TV studio she was often with horses, riding as well as teaching students with special needs how to saddle up and guide a gentle mare around a ring. She had the gentle but firm, no-nonsense way of a woman used to brushing down big animals, currying manes.

She would have tended to our dad’s hair, too, I’m sure, neatening his corona of gray around the back of his bald pate — my hair came from our mom’s side of the family — but he was old-school, the barber shop his convivial, bi-weekly destination.

I started out in that tradition. As a kid in Mobile I’d ride my bike a half-dozen blocks to where Mr. Snow, in a window behind the red-and-white pole out front, groomed us boys in pompadours made slick with Vitalis. For those of us who “acted up,” he threatened to show us “a jar of ears” in the back. We sat stock still in his barber’s chair.

As a teen, in military school, I found whomever I could to keep me shorn. By then, in a divide between mop heads on the left and crew cuts on the right, the tonsorial had become cultural. In 1968, on a high school trip to visit Sherrell in New York, she guided me to the new Broadway musical “Hair.” I felt freedom in the lyrics: “Flow it / show it / Long as God can grow it / My hair.” Maybe my sister was grooming me politically, too.

Sherrell took over my barber duties not long after I turned 18 and I was at liberty to let it grow. I’d relax on her kitchen stool as she kept me from looking scraggly while I’d reflect on college, later my first job, and soon marriage. As she’d tidy me up I’d relish her stories about moving to New York in 1960 as a “career girl” instead of marrying young down South, her forays into the fledgling world of television, and her career path in a male domain, behind the camera, from variety and talk shows to daytime drama. “You were a feminist,” I’d say, looking at her in a photo with two dozen other crew members of “The David Frost Show,” from 1970. She was easy to spot, not only for her raven hair already brushed silver. She was the only woman on the production team. “I just wanted,” she responded, “to make my own way.”

Her progressive spirit moved me, and the way she last saw me — a child of the 1960s heading toward his 60s, gray curls spilling from under a sun visor — was a portrait she’d helped create. Hair was no longer as defining politically, but it still spoke to the tribe we identify with, be it aging white men with the grad school look, free spirits, no matter thinning and receding, unbowed by time. She embraced that.

When she lost her own gorgeous hair during cancer treatment she spoke of it little, insisting on turning the attention to everyone else. She kept right on tending us all, a big sister watching out for the young ones, no matter our age. When her locks grew back we were joyous. They symbolized far more.

There was recurrence. She was 70 when we lost her.

I didn’t want anybody else, ever, to touch my hair again.

———

Not long ago Sherrell was given a posthumous alumni award at her high school in Mobile, and I received the honor on her behalf. I spoke of her love of family and home, her television career, her blazing and tender spirit. A group of her girlfriends at the event, now grandmothers, reminisced to me how they’d eat lunch beneath the big oaks on campus, sharing secrets, dreams.

Afterward I walked beneath those oaks toward the parking lot, seeing Sherrell and friends in the flush of youth, bangs and ponytails shining, visiting in the dappled shade. Back in my car I glanced in the rearview mirror and caught an image of myself, soaked through with Deep South humidity. My hair looked wild.

A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that Americans support same-sex marriage by a margin of nearly two-to-one. Forty-seven percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats voiced support of same-sex marriage in a 2017 Gallup poll. But what these numbers don’t reflect is how these views manifest themselves in daily life for L.G.B.T. Americans. This case is a public reminder that, though the law may guarantee a right, an individual’s actions can affect the way a group experiences its freedom.

I started planning my wedding in 2015, before I was engaged and before the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges made marriage equality the law of the land. I had a Google Doc full of pictures of obsidian tulips and interracial cake toppers, waiting on the world to change. My now-husband didn’t know what I was up to. But that didn’t matter. I was setting intentions for everything from my destiny to my cake flavors, irrespective of what the law would allow. However, once I started planning in earnest, I realized that actually executing a wedding is miserable and all I wanted was to begin my life with my husband as soon as possible.

Nothing has surprised me more than finding out I abhorred wedding planning. I consider myself a mix of Auntie Mame and the guy who is always dropping by Ina Garten’s house just in time for crudités and gossip. Putting on a huge to-do is what I was born for. I see it as part of a queer cultural inheritance: a resilient determination to celebrate, despite oppressive social policies.

It felt like the dream of my ancestors that I would be able to register for expensive gravy boats and sign a document held in City Hall. It also felt like a chore.

The saving grace of the monthslong gantlet was the promise of wedding expos. Americans spent an average of $35,329 on their weddings in 2016, according to a survey by the wedding site TheKnot.com. As in any other lucrative industry, there are thousands of vendors — caterers, florists, lighting designers — who would love nothing more than to help couples create their special day, for a price. Those vendors come together under one roof to lobby for business at wedding expos, which are like an office supply fair crossed with the Golden Globes. My dream.

“I have been waiting for this moment my entire life,” I told my husband-to-be, David, clutching my first expo registration like a golden ticket. “There will be so much free cake! There will be brochures! About napkins!” I waxed rhapsodic about signing onto the mailing lists of various D.J.’s; he nodded. He expressed regrets he couldn’t join. He’s a pastor and the expo was on a Sunday, a work day.

I wasn’t about to let religious expression get in the way of my pursuit of cake samples, so I went alone.

“Where’s the bride-to-be?” a vendor asked as I stared at his tower of orchids. I replied, “Well, there isn’t one.”

A lighting designer asked, “Are you making decisions for the lucky lady?” I cocked my head. “I am the lucky lady,” I said.

I had expected to be showered with attention and, more important, complimentary carbohydrates. Despite my “I’m getting married!” sticker, I found myself ignored.

I ventured up to the third floor and found a table with a surfeit of cake options, but no labels. “Do you think one of these is lemon?” a woman next to me asked. I turned to her: “There’s only one way to find out.”

She replied, “Eat them all?” My soul mate.

She asked me if I was enjoying myself. I shrugged. “Apparently, you’re invisible without a bride,” I said.

She told me she understood. She wore scrubs, with her hair tied back, a marked difference from the party-casual dress of many other attendees. She explained that she was a vet and had accidentally left her engagement ring at work. Grabbing two more slices of cake, we wandered away from the table.

We were interrupted by a voice: “Hello, young lovers!” We found ourselves in front of a centerpiece vendor who hadn’t had time for me earlier. A woman behind the table waved at us. “So, when’s the big day?” I looked at the vet. The vet replied, “August.”

“How big?” the vendor asked.

“150 people?” I said.

“So exciting,” the vendor said, as she cracked open a huge binder. As we excused ourselves, she grabbed my arm. “There’s Champagne downstairs,” she said, conspiratorially. “Make sure you all get some!”

Separately, the vet and I were two lonely, barely visible people with icing on our fingers. Together, we became a charming young black couple with a summer wedding and a deep interest in as many bite-size shortcakes as we could find. We looked the way people expected young and cake-worthy couples to look.

We agreed to take this expo for everything it had to offer. It turns out heteronormativity is a very effective con.

We bounced from table to table, collecting samples and spinning a tale of our joint bliss. At one point, taking a break from fish tacos and parfait trays, we leaned over a balcony and confessed that the process was harder than we’d thought it was going to be. Money was shorter; time was fleeting; nothing felt magical. It was easy to feel you were doing it all wrong.

“Thank you for being here,” I said. She and I may not have aligned with vendors’ ideas of who they were supposed to serve, but we both belonged.

Ignoring a person, a union or an expression of love will not make it go away. We all have the right to free samples, to be seen and to be overwhelmed by the reality of our love.

As the vet and I made moves to part ways, we realized we didn’t know each other’s names.

“I’m Eric,” I said. “I’m Jessica,” she replied.

But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.","Chris Donovan arrived in Flint after the scandal over the Michigan city’s contaminated water supply had been dominating national headlines. He was there, just like dozens of other journalists, covering the crisis. “When I first went, everything I was photographing was really obvious,” he said of his initial trip in 2015. “It was people handing out water, protests and people showering with bottled water.”

But the more he got to know the city and its people, the more frustrated he became with the popular narrative: that Flint was a bad place. So after the city’s turn in the breaking news spotlight, he has returned each year to tell the beleaguered city’s other stories.

He could relate: His hometown, Saint John, New Brunswick, is very much like Flint, with both industry and population shrinking. “I had no idea what to expect,” Mr. Donovan said, other than unemployed factory workers. He did find plenty of idled laborers, but he also found a city greater than the water crisis that still seemed to publicly define it long after the media had moved on.

Mr. Donovan was so dedicated to documenting that lesser-known side of Flint and its people that his friends gently teased him about spending spring break there. Mr. Donovan laughed and said it fits. He could either go back to his hometown in Canada or travel the much shorter five hours to Flint from Toronto, where he lives.

“I’ll continue to go back, and I’ll continue working in Flint probably the rest of my life, just because I have an attachment to the city and the story,” Mr. Donovan says.

His latest story is about the last high school football team in the city, The Jaguars. The team was born from the merger of two schools, Southwestern and Northwestern Academies, and their two teams: the Knights and the Wildcats. It also nods to the athletic history of the city, which has produced dozens of professional football players over the years.

Chris Wilson was one of those. He graduated from Flint Northern in 2000 and went on to play professionally, first in the Canadian Football League and for Washington’s N.F.L. team. He is now back home overseeing the school’s entire program — from 8-year-olds playing flag football to the varsity level playing full-contact.

He has a simple but much-needed mission: To instill hope and purpose in these young men, in much the same way those values were instilled in him.

“By having sports start early, not only do we put out better talent and create a better brand of football, but now kids can know how to go to school and get their work down and strive for a goal,” Mr. Wilson said. Rather than turning to the streets to make quick cash, young people can discover new options and possibilities for a positive life and career though the discipline and teamwork of sports.

Photo

The young men of the Flint Jaguars are, by all accounts, resilient and intelligent, growing up hard and playing a hard sport. To earn their trust, Mr. Donovan had to figuratively get off the bench. “A big part of the way that I work is sharing my own experiences with these kids to show them that I’m a human, that I’m not just there to take pictures and leave.”

He played basketball with them and talked with them, and their comfort with him is evident in his photos. Mr. Donovan is invisible on the field and the locker room, and the Jaguars are at ease around him enough to be themselves in their sport and in their emotions, whether those be grief, intensity or exultation. Under the stadium lights, or against the green school bus seats, they show up as young adherents of a beloved American sport.

Just as the rest of Flint has faced tough times, the school struggles financially, to the point that last year the sports program was hanging by a thread. The city is still plagued by toxic water, and off the field the players must contend with the dangers of every day life. But in those moments that Mr. Donovan captured on and off the field, it’s impossible not to see their strength.

Trey Huddleston gets ready for the homecoming dance while his mother watches; Alone Branch intently works out in the weight room, whether its football season or not. Jalynn Bond is somber one moment, walking through the neighborhood where he lost his brother to gun violence; the next, he’s grinning and flexing at his teammates in the locker room because one of them dared to suggest Mr. Bond was smaller.

As is his habit, Mr. Wilson stands at the center of them (Slide 7), leading a prayer to inspire the team before taking the field. At a game against their rivals, Saginaw High, a brawl erupted between players, and two police officers used pepper spray to break them up. Mr. Wilson and the other coaches restored order and handed out suspensions, but both he and Mr. Donovan criticized the use of pepper spray in ending a scuffle between teenagers, none of whom, Mr. Wilson noted, were being hostile to teachers or coaches.

The program still struggles, just like Flint still struggles. But while Mr. Wilson talks about those challenges and the sacrifices that have been made to keep this program running, he couches it in terms meant to motivate his Jaguars in their daily lives.

“If you haven’t folded already, in a poor city in America, dealing with a water crisis, guess what?” he said. “There’s nothing else out there for you. There’s nothing that’s gonna hit you harder than that.”

“The Rohingya are finished in our country,” said Mr. Kyaw Min, who lives in Yangon, the commercial capital of Myanmar. “Soon we will all be dead or gone.”

The United Nations report also said that the crackdown in Rakhine had “targeted teachers, the cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya history, culture and knowledge.”

“We are people with our own history and traditions,” said U Kyaw Hla Aung, a Rohingya lawyer and former political prisoner, whose father served as a court clerk in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.

“How can they pretend we are nothing?” he asked.

Speaking over the phone, Mr. Kyaw Hla Aung, who has been jailed repeatedly for his activism and is now interned in a Sittwe camp, said his family did not have enough food because officials have prevented full distribution of international aid.

WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, removed a top F.B.I. agent this summer from his investigation into Russian election meddling after the Justice Department’s inspector general began examining whether the agent had sent text messages that expressed anti-Trump political views, according to three people briefed on the matter.

The agent, Peter Strzok, is considered one of the most experienced and trusted F.B.I. counterintelligence investigators. He helped lead the investigation into whether Hillary Clinton had mishandled classified information on her private email account, and then played a major role in the investigation into links between President Trump’s campaign and Russia.

But Mr. Strzok was reassigned this summer from Mr. Mueller’s investigation to the F.B.I.’s human resources department, where he has been stationed since. The people briefed on the case said the transfer followed the discovery of text messages in which Mr. Strzok and a colleague reacted to news events, like presidential debates, in ways that could appear critical of Mr. Trump.

“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the special counsel’s office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” said a spokesman for the special counsel’s office, Peter Carr.

I was sitting at a bar near the far-flung N Gates at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, awaiting a flight to Nevada nearly six weeks after a high-stakes video poker player named Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more before taking his own life in Las Vegas. Heavily armed, Mr. Paddock fired on a crowd of 22,000 country music fans at an outdoor festival across the street from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the far south end of the Las Vegas Strip, marking one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

This tragedy did not appear to be on the minds of the quartet of women seated next to me, who were headed to Sin City to celebrate a 50th birthday. They ordered a round of tequila shots and chased them down with beer, a routine one imagined out loud would be repeated more than once during their excursion. Their unburdening of starch-collared decorum had commenced before they had even boarded the plane, suggesting that Vegas is a state of mind as much as it is a physical destination.

As for me, I was venturing to Las Vegas to assess the mood of a town that stands as America’s undisputed champion of fun and risk. It would go against Vegas’ s very essence to curl up and hide; how does a place this uniquely outgoing steel itself in the wake of such a tragedy?

Touching down at McCarran International Airport, Mandalay Bay was the first thing I saw out my window. But the way I knew I was in Las Vegas was by its scent, a singularly pungent bouquet of cologne, cigarette smoke, steak and sewage. It’s not especially pleasant, but it awakens you — and nobody comes to Vegas to sleep.

Nobody, that is, except for those who live and work here. Jordan Peck, a twentysomething bartender at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, is one such person. Born in Utah, he moved to Las Vegas when he was 2 years old and has been here ever since. Asked what someone who works on or near the Strip does for fun, he half-jokingly replied, “Go home.”

Since the shooting, Mr. Peck’s out-of-town customers haven’t blinked. “Everybody here seems exactly the same,” he said of the tourists.

But among locals or those who witnessed the horror at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, the story is quite different.

I sat down at Mr. Peck’s bar and ordered a Manhattan, which he gracefully placed atop a digital gambling console. This being the Hard Rock, Tom Petty’s “Learning to Fly” filled the air.

Mr. Paddock committed his atrocities on Oct. 1; Mr. Petty passed away on Oct. 2. On Oct. 7, Jason Aldean, the artist who was onstage when Mr. Paddock opened fire, made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” where he opened the show with a cover of Mr. Petty’s hit song “I Won’t Back Down.” It was a crippling confluence, and plenty profound.

Business was slow for Mr. Peck on this Thursday night, which gave him ample time to chat with his friend Renee McKinley, a Las Vegas native who works in a dental office. Today marked her first trip to the Strip (although the Hard Rock sits a few blocks off it) since the tragedy. When she drove past the “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign, which became a public shrine after Oct. 1, she started crying.

Growing up in Las Vegas, Ms. McKinley said, she viewed her hometown as a soulless entity. But the local response to Mr. Paddock’s crime has called this belief into doubt.

“The way our community stepped up, it proved me wrong,” she said.

To this end, Mr. Peck pointed to how so many people rushed to give blood in the wake of the shooting that a waiting list had to be established, and how volunteers flooded hospitals — not to get treatment, but to help clean up.

This sort of embrace could be felt through fiber optics, too. Shortly after the shooting, Ms. McKinley had to place an out-of-state call to verify a patient’s insurance coverage. As she said the words “Las Vegas,” her voice quivered. On the other end of the line, the woman felt her anguish and, said Ms. McKinley, “was hugging me through the phone.”

It was the weekend of Las Vegas’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon, which, with 25,000 participants, was to be the largest public event on the Strip since the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Sauntering through a sleepy Mandalay Bay casino on Friday morning were a pair of guests from Florida, Terri Monken and Jenny Glew, who were in town to run the half-marathon.

They had booked their rooms in March and gave no thought to canceling after the massacre. “We’ve got to keep it going,” explained Ms. Monken, praising her accommodations and the employees she had encountered as “beautiful.”

Ms. Glew then offered an assessment that I’d hear more than once over the course of my four-night stay, theorizing that Mandalay Bay “has got to be one of the safest places” in town in the wake of the tragedy. This was true in a visible sense, as the facility has beefed up security in order to reassure guests.

Up an escalator from the casino floor is a mini-mall called The Shoppes at Mandalay Place. At 10 a.m., Leanne Nevico opened The Guinness Store. Featuring beer gear galore, hers is the only outlet of its kind outside of Ireland.

A Connecticut native, Ms. Nevico moved to Las Vegas nearly a decade ago “for a man,” she said. She’s now been married to that man for five years; the pair met playing the interactive video game “Final Fantasy II,” and she described their home south of the Strip as “a gamer’s paradise.”

Like Ms. McKinley, Ms. Nevico said it’s been “really rough” driving by the Welcome to Las Vegas sign on her way to work each day, and she has been similarly moved by the way the community has rallied, recalling scenes of Uber drivers showing up to shuttle shooting victims to the hospital for free. Ms. Nevico wasn’t working when Mr. Paddock opened fire, but her employees had to shelter in place overnight. They were fortunate to have access to an adjacent pub that Guinness’ owners also operate, whereas a friend of hers who works at a sandal store had it a whole lot rougher absent food and a proper restroom.

The day after the shooting, Ms. Nevico said, “The casino was a ghost town.” But she opened her store — which features a bar from which she pours Guinness products — at 1 p.m. “for people who were stuck.”

“A lot of people just came in to drink and to share their stories,” she said.

Ms. Nevico said she has noticed a significant increase in the amount of police and private security patrolling the Mandalay Bay grounds, and noted that the resort has been stricken with an unusually high vacancy rate in the wake of the shooting. (A spokeswoman for MGM, which owns the Mandalay Bay, confirmed as much, adding that business is slowly returning to normal.) Mandalay Bay was recently named as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by 450 shooting victims, whose lawyers claim the resort and concert organizers didn’t do enough to prevent the tragedy.

“People are more vigilant,” said Ms. Nevico, who has noticed several “rubberneckers” angling for a look at the crime scene. “I don’t know what it is we’re looking for, but we’re more vigilant.”

A few miles north on Las Vegas Boulevard at Graceland Wedding Chapel, officiant Cecelia Cajueiro was preparing to renew the vows of a Brazilian couple, Fabio and Tatiana Costa, when Elvis Presley entered the building, wielding a guitar.

Portrayed by the chapel’s towering, hyperactive, pompadoured owner, Brendan Paul, the King incongruously plucked out melodies by AC/DC, Kiss and Metallica as the encore bride danced alongside him. Escorted by Elvis, Ms. Costa walked toward the altar to “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” ultimately cinching the Portuguese service with “Viva Las Vegas,” which Mr. Paul belted out on a microphone over a canned backing track.

Mr. Paul, clad in a black suit with red sapphires and no undershirt, has owned the chapel since 2003. Having cut his teeth playing in Los Angeles punk bands, he’s an unlikely proprietor and impersonator, and unflinchingly liberal.

“Every other Elvis I know is for Trump,” Mr. Paul said.

In part because Mr. Paul’s core clientele is international, the shooting down the street hasn’t affected his bottom line, he said. But it’s definitely been on his mind.

“People are just angry,” he surmised. “I think it’s because of Trump. It’s exhausting.”

West of the chapel, in an otherwise desolate neighborhood where tumbleweeds would find ample room to roll down roads, sits a funky drinking establishment called ReBar. Everything inside the bar — including the stools — is for sale, having been sourced or scavenged by the owner, Derek Stonebarger, a hip, energetic cancer survivor who heads up the Las Vegas Arts District Neighborhood Association.

A handful of Main Street businesses — a vintage clothing store here, a craft cocktail lounge there — anchor this fledgling, resident-focused scene in an area that “was always sort of a dumpy part of town,” said Jack Doré, a ReBar bartender.

“You used to come down here to buy drugs or get stabbed, or maybe both,” explained Mr. Doré, who rented a cheap studio apartment in the Arts District upon relocating from his native southeast Louisiana in 2014.

Late Sunday morning, he had ReBar’s television sets tuned to N.F.L. football and was doling out $1 Avery Real Peel I.P.A.s and locally butchered hot links to a smattering of customers.

Of the shooting, Mr. Doré said, “No one really talks about it. The first couple of weeks were pretty slow, but it’s back to normal. I don’t know if there will be a normal, though. People are wary of going out in groups. But, most of all, people are just brushing it off.”

Having hosted numerous country music awards shows, not to mention the Route 91 Harvest Festival, Las Vegas has become a sort of Nashville West in recent years. At the center of its local country community is Stoney’s Rockin’ Country, a spacious nightclub in a shopping mall south of Mandalay Bay that offers all-you-can-drink Pabst for $25 and line-dancing lessons before live shows.

As I entered Stoney’s to take in a performance by the insurgent band A Thousand Horses, I was asked to raise my hands as though I were passing through security at an airport. This is a milder approach than the metal-detecting wands the establishment’s bouncers wielded in the weeks immediately following the massacre, said Stoney’s spokesman Toad Higginbotham, who was backstage with his girlfriend at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when shots rang out.

“We just ran,” he said of his reaction to the gunfire.

Stoney’s patrons Kristi Klein and Julie Cavender of Orange County, Calif., were at the festival as well. They were also staying at Mandalay Bay in a room overlooking Mr. Paddock’s. The two friends couldn’t bring themselves to book a room there for this return trip, instead opting for The Wynn.

“The reality is we all have PTSD,” Ms. Cavender said.

Added Ms. Klein, “That’s why we’re here.”

Yet it comes across like an interpolated concert aria, suggesting both the strengths and shortcomings of this ambitious new opera.","The opera opens with Clarence, a hearty miner (the exuberant bass-baritone Ryan McKinny), who sets up the story almost as if giving a lecture.

“It was a driving, vigorous, restless population,” Mr. McKinny sings lustily over skittish, pointillist music in the orchestra. “Not dainty, simpering kid-gloved weaklings, but muscular, stalwart, dauntless young braves.” (The words come from Mark Twain’s “Roughing It.”)

When Ned (the charismatic young bass-baritone Davóne Tines) first appears, he describes himself in the third person: “Ned Peters was a hustler from Independence town,” Mr. Tines sings in virile, restless phrases. Most of Ned’s words come from the journals of fugitive slaves.

For “Doctor Atomic,” the previous collaboration between Mr. Adams and Mr. Sellars, which had its premiere here in 2005, Mr. Sellars also assembled a libretto from poetry, journals and original documents. Though the results had awkward aspects, that opera maintained a strong narrative impetus: Its plot was driven by a countdown to the first detonation of a nuclear bomb.

Mr. Sellars’s patched-together approach doesn’t work as well for “Girls,” a work that cavalierly invites comparisons with Puccini’s “La Fanciulla del West” (“The Girl of the West”), an Italian’s take on the Gold Rush. The historical Dame Shirley was a fascinating woman with a pioneering spirit. But her story gets lost amid what comes across as a bold attempt to write the great California opera — a sweeping tale of the mad quest for fortune that was the mostly disastrous Gold Rush.

Some exciting stretches, conducted with crackling energy and color by Grant Gershon, certainly convey the teeming wildness, racial animosity and lawless violence that roiled the West. The rugged miners sing words taken from actual miners’ songs, set to rhythmically fractured music, enlivened with accordion and cow bells. The tenor Paul Appleby gives a dynamic performance as Joe Cannon, a miner who leaves behind a girl in Missouri, who then abandons him to marry a butcher back home, as Joe learns during a boisterous scene in a bar full of drunken miners. Joe finds comfort with a Chinese prostitute, Ah Sing (the brilliant coloratura soprano Hye Jung Lee), who decides that Joe, a client, would also make an ideal mate.

Two compelling singers, the baritone Elliot Madore and the mezzo-soprano J’Nai Bridges, bring poignant intensity to the roles of Ramón and Josefa, a young Mexican couple who work at the bar. Ramón smolders with rage, fearing that at any moment, the Americans could turn on him or abuse Josefa, a fear that leads to the opera’s harrowing conclusion. But Ramón’s words mostly come from the Gold Rush diary of a South American journalist, and Josefa’s from an Argentine poet. Even during moments of romance, in Mr. Adams’s hazy, shimmering music, the lovers sound as if they were mere mouthpieces, singing past each other.

Mr. Adams and Mr. Sellars might have opted for a middle-ground approach and folded a few of Shirley’s letters, like the revealing one about the Native Americans, along with other poems and speeches, into a libretto that told a clearer story.

During the second act, the encampment celebrates the Fourth of July. The enormous stump of a sequoia (one of many striking elements of David Gropman’s sets) becomes a makeshift stage for entertainments.

At one point, Mr. Tines’s Ned mounts the stump to sing a stinging aria based on “What to a Slave Is the Fourth of July?” — a bitterly powerful 1852 speech by Frederick Douglass. It’s a tour de force moment for Mr. Tines and, in a way, for Mr. Adams.

While napping at the apartment one day, Ms. Stevens had a series of flashbacks and nightmares: Ms. Berman even made an image of Ms. Stevens in the midst of one episode.
Ms. Stevens eventually resettled in New York, where Ms. Berman spent years advocating for her care and speaking with her doctors and social workers.
Both cared deeply about verifying Ms. Stevens’ memories — Ms. Berman went as far as to go to London to corroborate her recollections and make images that spoke to them.
Ms. Berman and Ms. Stevens each characterized their relationship in different ways at different times — photographer-subject, mother-daughter, caregiver-patient, and collaborators.","In the first pages of “An Autobiography of Miss Wish,” the reader meets Kimberly Stevens multiple times: In handwritten notes; dark, cinematic images; drawings of knives and books; and a beaming childhood portrait. Then there’s her psychiatric history written in detached clinical jargon, and a portrait of her prone, living on the street.

This visceral book lays out her life, drawing readers in even before fully understanding what they are looking at. “An autobiography of Miss Wish” is a collaboration between Nina Berman, a documentary photographer, and Ms. Stevens, a survivor of sex trafficking and child pornography whom Ms. Berman met 27 years ago in London.

Ms. Berman had traveled there to photograph the impact of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s policies. She met Ms. Stevens, who at the time went by Cathy, while photographing young drug users living on the streets. The others she met had been standoffish, but Cathy was curious and fascinated to learn more about the U.S. Over the course of the time of their subsequent relationship spanning decades and continents, Ms. Stevens faced chronic homelessness, drug use, mental illness, and severe post-traumatic stress from the years of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse in childhood.

Medical records, diaries, and letters in the book show how her abusers cowed her into silence and brutally punished her when she spoke up. They also attest to how she was failed by people with whom she shared her tale. A back-and-forth — of wanting to share yet being terrified of the consequences — runs throughout the entire book.

“I thought it would be the most powerful move I could do, to tell everything I had been told to keep a secret my whole life,” Ms. Stevens said. “I can look at [this book] and close it again.”

Photo

Ms. Stevens was born poor, a young girl of color adopted into a middle class white family, and was often put in danger by the authority figures in her life. In her earliest writings, it is clear that she knew her word would be doubted, and that the burden of proof would be on her. So she began collecting things.

“I’ve spent my entire life collecting evidence,” she said. “I used to go with my family and take things from various places — in a constant fight to prove what happened.”

The twist in her case was she had Ms. Berman’s help in safeguarding the material, a challenge given Ms. Stevens’s chronic homelessness. The documents, writings and drawings by and about Ms. Stevens constitute a remarkable record about a life that far too often would otherwise go unnoticed and unchronicled.

The book comes out at a time when headlines about sexual violence are a daily occurrence, given the recent outpouring of accounts of sexual harassment and assault in the worlds of film, finance and media.

“Women of a certain privilege are speaking out in every industry,” Ms. Berman said. “It is tremendously important, and hopefully people will start to understand that this is endemic.”

For Ms. Berman, the book is in some ways a continuation of the work she has done over her career, addressing recurring themes, like how hierarchies of power operate, how justice is fought for and found, and how individuals live with the effects of violence. Yet, it is a departure, too, because it is more personal and non-traditional than her previous projects.

“This is work that I live,” she said, “not just a project that I go out and conceive of and go out and shoot.”

Though the London images went unpublished — editors were blasé — Ms. Stevens traveled to New York in 1991 thanks to prize money from a music competition and ended up staying with Ms. Berman. While napping at the apartment one day, Ms. Stevens had a series of flashbacks and nightmares: Ms. Berman even made an image of Ms. Stevens in the midst of one episode. That was the last one she took of her, aside for snapshots for family albums, until around 2008, since she felt uncomfortable photographing her in that vulnerable state.

Ms. Stevens eventually resettled in New York, where Ms. Berman spent years advocating for her care and speaking with her doctors and social workers. She went through good and terrible phases; both she and Ms. Berman were uncertain if she would even survive. But she did, and the two discussed collaborating on a book about her journey.

The process involved both of them anticipating and confronting the pushback they imagined the project would cause. Both cared deeply about verifying Ms. Stevens’ memories — Ms. Berman went as far as to go to London to corroborate her recollections and make images that spoke to them.

“I only included the memories I am fully aware of and very clear on what happened,” Ms. Stevens said. “Everything that’s there, I’m fully aware of.”

This concern about the reliability of traumatic memories reflects not just journalistic standards, but, in recounting sexual violence, it also ties into a larger history of how women’s memories of assault are remembered and accepted.

For example, Dr. Judith Herman’s writings on the history of trauma studies traces the discipline back to Sigmund Freud and his study of women in the late-1800s experiencing what was then called “hysteria.” His interviews with women experiencing flashbacks and nightmares — that are now seen as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, led him to conclude that sexual assault was the root cause. Yet, given how widespread hysteria was among women, he withdrew his findings, because to accept them would mean that sexual assault and abuse were commonplace. Instead, he said his female patients’ “scenes of seduction had never taken place … only fantasies which my patients had made up.”

Women’s testimonies continue to be dismissed, making cases of sexual violence among the hardest crimes to prosecute successfully. “All too often, survivors of sexual violence are challenged and asked to defend their narrative,” Ms. Berman wrote, “while perpetrators, because of the rules of evidence and the fear instilled in victims, are left free to continue to profit from their violent schemes.”

For women who lack the stature of celebrity or access to the media, the book echoes the current conversation and includes a group often excluded. It also challenges traditional storytelling methods and what it means to be on one side of the camera versus the other. Ms. Berman and Ms. Stevens each characterized their relationship in different ways at different times — photographer-subject, mother-daughter, caregiver-patient, and collaborators. Throughout, they spoke often about the effect that they were having on each other and what that meant for their common creation.

Just as important, Ms. Berman rejected a sentiment among some who document the lives of the less fortunate: that they are “giving voice to the voiceless” — a condescending construct, if anything. Ms. Stevens is hardly voiceless, but her voice was suppressed or ignored by authorities and agencies that were supposed to help her.

And while the book is about Ms. Stevens, it is also a glimpse into Ms. Berman’s life, and it contextualizes her other works. In an industry that emphasizes objectivity and erasing oneself from the work, this book allows the reader to see what both Ms. Stevens has lived through and what Ms. Berman has experienced with her. Ms. Stevens’ two suicide attempts at Rikers Island when she was jailed on a minor drug charge showed Ms. Berman the flaws of New York City’s criminal justice system, and these experiences are echoed in her subsequent projects on subjects ranging from police stop-and-frisk policy, to the role of the security state and surveillance in post-9/11 America.

Ultimately, Ms. Stevens hopes this collaborative book will be a testament to resilience.

“I feel a lot stronger having made the book,” she said. “Before that, I felt like a victim. I don’t want to be called a survivor or a victim, I just want to live—I don’t want to just survive. I want to move on to the next chapter of my life.”

“Everyone wants to be not so dependent on Facebook,” Mr. Banisauskas told me.
Several publishers from countries included in the test complained that their Facebook traffic had plummeted overnight.
For now, though, Bored Panda is charging ahead, and hoping to remain on Facebook’s good side.","The company has done all this without raising outside funding, unlike digital powerhouses such as BuzzFeed and Vice, which have collected hundreds of millions of dollars. It also has only 41 employees, and the low operating costs, along with its enormous popularity, have made for good business. Tomas Banisauskas, Bored Panda’s founder, told me he expects to be profitable this year with $20 million to $30 million in revenue, mostly from the advertisements that appear on its website. Roughly 90 percent of its web traffic comes from Facebook, making the social network by far the biggest factor in Bored Panda’s success.

“They’re a really helpful company for us,” Mr. Banisauskas, 31, said of Facebook.

Bored Panda began as a side project in 2009, while Mr. Banisauskas, then a freelance videographer, was studying business administration at Vilnius University. He was inspired by feats of internet creativity like the Million Dollar Homepage, in which an entrepreneur auctioned off a million pixels on a website for $1 each. And he came up with the idea for a website that would, as he put it, “fight boredom with art and good news stories.”

On the content side, Bored Panda’s strategy followed a familiar playbook. It collected user-generated content from Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and other social platforms and repackaged it with tempting headlines. But by focusing on art, photography and other creative pursuits, and by studiously sticking to the kind of apolitical content that few people object to, Bored Panda has steadily built a feel-good, escapist empire.

Bored Panda has the advantage of getting most of its content free from up-and-coming artists and other creative types who want the kind of exposure a large Facebook page can bring. (And, yes, it does ask for permission. I contacted several artists whose work had been featured on Bored Panda, and all said they’d given their blessing.) It has also adopted a quality-over-quantity strategy that appears to have served it well. It published only 519 articles in October, or roughly 16 posts a day, according to NewsWhip. Compare that with CNN, which published 5,595 articles during the month, and Fox News, which published 51,919 articles.

It hasn’t been a straight line to success. In its early days, Bored Panda relied on StumbleUpon, a link aggregation site that was popular at the time, for much of its traffic. But in 2010, according to Mr. Banisauskas, StumbleUpon sharply reduced Bored Panda’s prominence on the site and pressured him to buy ads instead.

As Mr. Banisauskas would later write in a post on Medium, the experience taught him that “the only way to survive in this industry is to build long-term value through loyal followers.”

The next several years were a struggle, but in 2013, Bored Panda began to see a spike in viewers being sent from a new source: Facebook. Its positive, lighthearted content was a hit with the social network’s users, and the site’s traffic grew tenfold in a single year. Soon, despite Mr. Banisauskas’s intentions, Bored Panda was far from self-sufficient — its prospects hinged almost entirely on Facebook.

More recently, while its competitors have hedged their risks by diversifying away from Facebook, Bored Panda has made a conscious effort to pull the platform even closer. It has started several offshoot Facebook brands, including pages for art and animal-themed stories, and a page called Crafty Panda that focuses on D.I.Y. projects. It has begun creating original content, too, and recently set up a video studio in its office, a hospital from the 19th century that was converted into a tech office complex.

“Everyone wants to be not so dependent on Facebook,” Mr. Banisauskas told me. “At the same time, it’s impossible — Facebook is the place where people share their ideas.”

Photo

But dependence comes with real risk. Last month, for example, Facebook began testing a new design for its news feed. In this version, which is being tested in six countries, Facebook posts from pages (including businesses, public figures and publishers like Bored Panda) were removed from the regular news feed. They were placed in a separate section called “Explore Feed,” where they appeared less prominently.

This change caused tremors in the Facebook publishing world. Several publishers from countries included in the test complained that their Facebook traffic had plummeted overnight. A social media manager from a news site in Slovakia, one of the countries included in the test, called it the “biggest drop in Facebook organic reach we have ever seen.”

Facebook told me it planned to continue testing the Explore Feed changes for several more months. In a blog post, Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of news feed, wrote that the test was meant to “understand if people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content,” but that the company had “no plans to roll this test out further.”

Rafat Ali, a digital publishing veteran and chief executive of the travel media company Skift, said that while these particular algorithmic changes might not come to pass, sites like Bored Panda could still be easily crushed by a future Facebook experiment.

“You never know when the rug could be pulled from under them,” Mr. Ali said. “They could be done in a year or two.”

Mr. Banisauskas knows that Facebook can be a fickle landlord, and he worries that as a small foreign company that specializes in aggregated entertainment content, Bored Panda is in a more precarious position than most. Roughly half of Bored Panda’s Facebook audience is American, and Mr. Banisauskas worries that the site could be punished inadvertently by efforts to combat fake news and Russian-style influence campaigns.

“We’re not part of the problem,” he said, “but we could get the collateral damage.”

Last summer, Mr. Banisauskas traveled to New York to meet with a group of other Facebook-focused publishers. All these companies produce entertaining material that reaches millions of people every day. In another era, that alone might have been enough to guarantee them a stable future. Today, they exist at Facebook’s mercy and might be wiped away at any moment.

For now, though, Bored Panda is charging ahead, and hoping to remain on Facebook’s good side.

“Everyone should be worried,” Mr. Banisauskas said, before he injected a note of Bored Panda-style positivity: “But I believe everything will work out well.”",How 41 People in Lithuania Took Over Your Facebook Feed,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/technology/facebook-bored-panda.html

Constructor Notes

In the Steinberg family, we keep a small notebook in each room of our house and in the car. That way, if one of us gets inspired by a crossword idea or entry, it can easily be written down. My dad is particularly (in) famous for coming up with crossword ideas in the middle of the night, scribbling them down, and then excitedly barging into my room the next morning to pitch them to me. I love my dad very much, but I’m not at all a morning person, and … well, I don’t always share his enthusiasm about the ideas themselves. On one typical morning a few years ago, Dad was super excited about the idea of doing a shell game puzzle. “You could even stick thimblerig into the puzzle! I bet no one will know that,” he said gleefully as he showed me a picture he’d scribbled down. In the picture, he had three C-U-P arrangements covering a marble, a shell, and a pea. “Sure the cups look triangular, and you can’t actually squeeze a six-letter PEBBLE into a three-letter CUP, but I’m sure you’ll figure something out!” he said as he made his exit. I just groaned and went back to sleep. Fast forward to September of this year. I was looking through one of the idea notebooks (at a non-A.M. hour, mind you) and came across the shell game idea. After chuckling to myself, I decided to give it a makeover. No more triangular cups, marbles, or pebbles (sorry, Dad). In a nutshell, the puzzle eventually turned into what you see. In my opinion, F is the correct answer to the quasi-Schrodinger square at the 127-Across/128-Down crossing, but I could see an argument the other way as well. Happy solving!

O.K., that’s it. We’re definitely going to be seeing a crossword with a “David Steinberg’s Dad” byline one of these days.

Happy holidays! In the spirit of the season, here’s a suggestion: Instead of inflicting a garish tie on your brother or a carcinogenic face cream on your aunt, how about saving a life?

It’s time for my annual “gifts with meaning” guide, with suggestions for presents that won’t just clog a chest of drawers. Consider a $20 flock of ducks to an impoverished Bangladeshi family through Heifer International, or a $143 CARE scholarship for a girl in a developing country to attend high school. Or some other ideas you may not have thought of:

Deworm a child. Or a village of children! One-quarter of people worldwide have worms in their bellies, impairing their nutrition and often leaving them anemic. Children can be dewormed for about 50 cents each, and this leads them to miss less school and earn more as adults. Kids in the American South were dewormed 100 years ago by the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, leading to large gains in school enrollment and in literacy, and now we can easily and cheaply achieve the same gains worldwide.

An excellent website called Givewell.org rigorously examines which charitable causes get the most bang for the buck (I strongly recommend browsing the site), and it recommends several deworming organizations. My favorite (yes, I have a favorite dewormer) is Deworm the World.

Pull a tooth! Millions of Americans can’t afford health or dental insurance, and a lifeline comes from volunteer doctors and dentists working through Remote Area Medical, an aid group that holds huge health fairs for those with no other access to help. During my visit to a fair in Virginia, I watched as one 30-year-old man had 18 teeth pulled.

“To make the field grow and expand and have the procedure come out to more women, it has to be reproduced,” she said, adding that within hours of Baylor’s announcement, advocacy groups for women with uterine infertility from all over the world had contacted her to express their excitement at the news.

“It was a very exciting birth,” Dr. Johannesson said. “I’ve seen so many births and delivered so many babies, but this was a very special one.”

At Baylor, eight women have had transplants, including the new mother, in a clinical trial designed to include 10 patients. One recipient is pregnant, and two others — one of whom received her transplant from a deceased donor — are trying to conceive. Four other transplants failed after the surgery, and the organs had to be removed, said Dr. Giuliano Testa, principal investigator of the research project and surgical chief of abdominal transplantation.

“We had a very rough start, and then hit the right path,” Dr. Testa said in a telephone interview. “Who paid for it in a certain way were the first three women. I feel very thankful for their contribution, more so than I can express.”

Both Dr. Johannesson and Dr. Testa said that a large part of their motivation came from meeting patients and coming to understand how devastated they were to find out that they would not be able to have children.

Dr. Testa said: “I think many men will never understand this fully, to understand the desire of these women to be mothers. What moved all of us is to see the mother holding her baby, when she was told, ‘You will never have it.’”

The transplants are now experimental, with much of the cost covered by research funds. But they are expensive, and if they become part of medical practice, will probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is not clear that insurers will pay, and Dr. Testa acknowledged that many women who want the surgery will not be able to afford it.

Another hospital, the Cleveland Clinic, performed the first uterus transplant in the United States in February 2016, but it failed after two weeks because of an infection that caused life-threatening hemorrhage and required emergency surgery to remove the organ. The clinic halted its program for an extended period, but has restarted it and has patients awaiting transplants, a spokeswoman, Victoria Vinci, said.

The woman who gave birth at Baylor was the fourth to receive a transplant there, in September 2016.

The process is complicated and has considerable risks for both recipients and donors. Donors undergo a five-hour operation that is more complex and takes out more tissue than a standard hysterectomy to remove the uterus. The transplant surgery is also difficult, in some ways comparable to a liver transplant, Dr. Testa said.

Recipients face the risks of surgery and anti-rejection drugs for a transplant that they, unlike someone with heart or liver failure, do not need to save their lives. Their pregnancies are considered high-risk, and the babies have to be delivered by cesarean section to avoid putting too much strain on the transplanted uterus. So far all the births have occurred a bit earlier than the normal 40 weeks of gestation — at 32 to 36 weeks.

Women who have transplants cannot conceive the natural way, because their ovaries are not connected to the uterus, so there is no way for an egg to get in there. Instead, they need in vitro fertilization. Before the transplant, women are given hormone treatments to make their ovaries release multiple eggs, which are then harvested, fertilized and frozen.

Once the woman has fully recovered from surgery and begun menstruating, the eggs can be implanted in the uterus, one at a time, until she becomes pregnant.

In Sweden, doctors waited a year after the transplant before trying to start a pregnancy, to allow the women time to heal. At Baylor, the team moved much faster, and began trying to impregnate the women within a few months of the surgery, soon after they began menstruating.

Dr. Testa said it was his idea to start the pregnancies earlier, because the women were young and healthy, and did not need a year to bounce back from surgery. He argued that the waiting time just kept them on anti-rejection drugs — which have significant side effects — for longer than necessary.

“We went shorter,” he said. “I think we were right.”

He and Dr. Johannesson said the Swedish team, and other centers planning transplants, had also begun to consider shortening the wait.","Woman With Transplanted Uterus Gives Birth, the First in the U.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/health/uterus-transplant-baby.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The new manager of the Yankees has a charming little parlor trick that just might help in the dugout. Show Aaron Boone almost any baseball card, and he can tell you where the photo was taken, simply from the background details. By extension — and more important — he knows precisely what the player is doing, too.

“He has a photographic memory of details, of physicality, of mechanics,” said Jim Bowden, who drafted Boone as general manager of the Cincinnati Reds. “It’s a really special trait. If something’s off, even a little bit, he’ll pick up on it immediately because his brain sees stuff that most brains don’t.”

Boone, 44, has not been officially announced as Joe Girardi’s successor with the Yankees. But General Manager Brian Cashman selected Boone from a pool of six candidates, and the managing general partner, Hal Steinbrenner, approved. Boone was an ESPN broadcaster with no coaching or managing experience, but his baseball lineage runs deep.

In 1980, at age 7, he rode in a parade float down Broad Street in Philadelphia, celebrating the Phillies’ World Series title. His father, Bob, was their catcher — an All-Star like his grandfather Ray Boone and his brother Bret. The boys were regulars around Veterans Stadium, and later in Anaheim after Bob joined the California Angels.

Before his last game with the Phillies, in the 1981 playoffs, Bob Boone did an interview with Tom Seaver on NBC. Seaver asked how he prepared that morning.

“A little different for me today, Tom,” he said. “I got here a little later than I normally do. I had to go out and watch my son play pee-wee football this morning. It was a really exciting game, a nip-and-tuck battle. They ended up losing, 7-0, but it was quite a game. It was a nice, relaxing morning for me.”

It was the kind of answer you could imagine Aaron giving now about his own sons — detailed, sincere and just a bit silly. The play-by-play man, Don Criqui, followed up by remarking on the Boone family.

“There’s never been three generations to make it to the major leagues,” he said, “but they say the Boones might well be the first.”

They were indeed, and Aaron embodies a bit of all of them, according to Hal McCoy, the longtime baseball writer for the Dayton Daily News, who grew up watching Ray Boone play for Cleveland and covered the other three.

“Ray was more of a stern guy, Bob was a cerebral guy, Bret was a tough guy,” McCoy said. “Aaron is a combination of all of them. That’s what makes him stand out. He can be cerebral and tough at the same time.”

The Reds drafted Boone from the University of Southern California in the third round in 1994, drawn by his athleticism, smarts and background. Boone could be fiery; he was ejected from his major league debut three years later for throwing his helmet after a play at the plate. But he was also a keen observer, thirsting for information despite a lifetime in the clubhouse.

“He always wants to know more about the global part of the game,” said Bowden, who now works for MLB Network Radio. “He was curious about the front office, the bullpen, the scouting room, the draft room — always curious about how things worked. He truly loved all aspects of the game.”

That extends to the people who cover it. Just before spring training in 2003, McCoy suffered strokes in both optic nerves. His sports editor sent him to spring training in Sarasota, Fla., and McCoy — nearly blind — struggled to recognize faces in the clubhouse. Boone pulled him aside and asked what was wrong. McCoy explained and said he was going to quit.

“He grabbed me by the elbow and sat me down,” McCoy said. “He said: ‘I don’t ever want to hear you say you’re giving up. You love what you do too much. Everybody in this clubhouse will help you.’ He was right.”

McCoy credits Boone’s kindness with saving his career. Naturally, Boone also ribbed McCoy, playfully — he once asked why he was talking to a Coke machine. But when Boone’s name appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot, he received only one vote: McCoy’s.

Meeting the demands of the news media, who meet twice a day with the manager, should go smoothly for Boone. In a market like New York, a manager without those skills would create unneeded distractions.

“He’ll be a Joe Torre type of guy — everybody’s going to love him,” McCoy said. “He was our go-to guy. If the Reds lost, he was at his seat after every game, answering questions. There were days when the clubhouse would be completely empty, except for Aaron. Even if he had nothing to do with the loss, he would be introspective and available.”

The Reds traded Boone to the Yankees in July 2003, and his homer won Game 7 of the American League Championship Series — a moment that turned out to be the final gasp of Yankees superiority over the rival Boston Red Sox. Boone’s off-season knee injury, sustained while he played basketball, cost him most of his $5.75 million contract and led the Yankees to trade for Alex Rodriguez.

Boone played five more seasons, with four teams. He finished with Houston in 2009, playing 10 games down the stretch without a hit. But it was a triumph because Boone — then just 36 — had undergone open-heart surgery in March to fix a problem with his aorta and aortic valve, a condition he had known about since college.

A year later, he was calling games for ESPN. He lives with his family in Arizona and voraciously follows his favorite football teams, U.S.C. and the Philadelphia Eagles. He imitated batting stances, pitching motions and other mannerisms on his broadcasts. He was an aggressive fantasy baseball owner in a SiriusXM league with hosts and callers; his team name, “Hum Baby,” was the catchphrase of Roger Craig, a San Francisco Giants manager popular with players.

Boone’s ability to connect, especially in a young Yankees clubhouse, was said to be critical to Cashman. Previous managing experience is hardly necessary anymore; 17 of the 30 major league managers, including Boone, are working in their first major league managing job. In some ways, Boone fits the modern profile — he is one of 26 current managers who attended college, and has recent playing experience.

“He has the swag of a player,” Bowden said. “That’s important with this generation. Very few have it, and you can’t fake it.”

Those relationships should help Boone sell players on the vision of the front office, which may be the manager’s most important task in the era of analytics. The Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who just met in the World Series, often used unconventional strategies based on data. Their managers, A. J. Hinch and Dave Roberts, got players to buy in.

“Joe Girardi had a great 10-year run, but what Brian did was look at the next 10 years,” Bowden said. “Joe was great for the last 10 years, like Joe Torre was great before him. But the game is changing at such a speed that you’ve got to be able to not only jump on and go with it, but relate it to this generation of young stars.”

Those stars may already know Boone’s most famous moment, which plays on the scoreboard before every game at Yankee Stadium: the knuckleball from Tim Wakefield, the deep fly ball into the left-field seats, the joyous throng at the plate.

All these years later, though, if you ask Boone what he remembers most about the homer, he’ll mention something different: As he floated around the bases, the Velcro came loose on his batting gloves. If you’re paying attention, you can notice the strap dangling off his wrist in every highlight.

To Boone, the details always matter. Now more than ever.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today’s crossword by Timothy Polin has a lot going for it, not the least of which is that it serves as a handy reminder that the winter solstice is coming up in December.

Other than that, the puzzle is a fun, midweek tug-of-war between our brains and the constructor and editors.

Today’s Theme

Did you think today’s theme was a rebus? Remember, I’ve told you that if you have difficulty filling in entries that you know are right, you should suspect a rebus element.

This can also happen with a dropped word theme, which is what we have today, among other theme elements. You might have had difficulty around the perimeter of the grid, and there’s a reason for that: The full answer includes a directional word (north, east, south or west) that is dropped.

As for Ms. Dorkhman, her last Manhattan apartment was a windowless closet in an East Village share for which she paid $1,250 a month.

That proved to be an ever-present challenge when a Belgian photographer, Thomas de Wouters, sought to document a growing youth movement devoted to nonviolence.

When he arrived there a year ago, street clashes had just left more than 50 people dead in the troubled Central African nation after opposition groups protested President Joseph Kabila’s efforts to extend his rule for an unconstitutional third term. Mr. Kabila’s mandate was about to expire, and security forces were deployed to suppress dissent.

“The tension was really high,” said Mr. de Wouters, who had to elude state intelligence services arresting activists. “Everything had to be secure and discreet. For the first five or six days, I just ended up doing clandestine meetings and interviews in different places. I didn’t take any pictures.”

Eventually, he earned the trust of members of the youth group Lutte pour le Changement (Struggle for Change, or LUCHA), a self-declared nonviolent citizens movement formed in 2012 to challenge the existing political disorder in a vast and chaotic nation that has teetered for decades on the brink of collapse.

Brutal Belgian colonists first plundered Congo’s rubber and used slave labor to build railways that have since fallen into disrepair. Then came the kleptocratic dictator Mobutu Sese Seko who bled state coffers dry during his 32-year rule. Over the past two decades, an equally corrupt and dysfunctional government has been locked in conflict with an assortment of militias that split the country into fiefdoms. They live by the gun while battling for control over natural resources, including gold, diamonds and timber. Since 1994, a staggering five million people have died in Congo’s conflict, many of them violently, but most from deprivation, hunger and disease.

Washington has warned President Kabila that Congo must hold long-delayed elections by the end of 2018, or the vote will lose international support.

But Congo’s population long ago lost trust in any level of government or the international community’s ability to untangle Congo’s constant state of disaster despite the world’s largest and most expensive U.N. peacekeeping mission.

Against this backdrop, Mr. de Wouters set about documenting the efforts of LUCHA, one of several grassroots movements that have emerged in West Africa, including Senegal and Burkina Faso. These groups promote civic engagement and youth mobilization and form strategies on how to peacefully challenge the state’s failure to provide basic services like running water, health care, education and security. Social media is an essential tool for spreading ideas and expanding their reach. LUCHA operates as a non-hierarchical, decentralized network of cells, preventing anyone within the movement from becoming too important.

“Normally when that happens to a movement, the government tries to stop them or corrupt them, but this way they can’t,” Mr. de Wouters, 47, said by phone from Brussels.

The photographer was not interested in making the kind of dramatic images that often dominate news coverage from the republic. Instead, he focused on the daily lives of LUCHA members, using square format black and white film to document their meetings, family lives and day jobs in and around the eastern city of Goma, where a handful of activists founded the group five years ago. LUCHA now says it has some 1,000 members, most in their 20s and 30s, in 18 Congolese cities.

Mr. de Wouters’s images show some protest marches and arrests (Slides 4 and 5), but it’s the quieter, mundane moments that linger: a man speaking into a microphone in a broadcast studio; activists sitting around a low table in a storeroom surrounded by sacks; people on the streets collecting water, or in gardens planting vegetables (Slide 6). The timeless quality of the images reflects a country’s almost hopeless struggle to move forward despite a wealth of natural resources and billions of dollars of foreign investment.

Congo has spawned countless “movements” since its independence in 1960, but few have brought anything other than more instability. But for Mr. de Wouters, LUCHA’s commitment to peaceful dialogue represents a generational shift. And their bravery in the face of violent repression and frequent detention without trial offers hope. Ultimately, Mr. de Wouters said, it’s up to the Congolese to find solutions to the country’s complex problems.

“My point is that maybe this is the start of some real change,” he said. “When I see them, I start to believe it’s possible.”

If the House were to simply approve the Senate bill, it would head to Mr. Trump straight away.","Mr. Trump echoed that optimism, writing on Twitter that “we are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts” and that he looked forward to signing a final bill before Christmas.

The differences between the measures, though substantial, do not appear troublesome enough to prevent Mr. Trump from achieving that goal, which would be his first major legislative victory.

Among the issues that will need to be worked out: Under the Senate bill, tax cuts for individuals would expire at the end of 2025 to mitigate the losses in revenue, and the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act would be repealed. The House bill does not have these provisions.

The two versions also employ different methods to try to prevent multinational companies from shifting profits out of America and into lower-tax countries.

In addition, the House bill would set a new 25 percent top tax rate for profits earned by small businesses and other so-called pass-through companies, while the Senate bill would give the owners of those companies a 23 percent deduction on pass-through income, which is taxed at rates for individuals.

The House bill would eliminate the alternative minimum tax for corporations and individuals and eventually eliminate the estate tax. The Senate bill would maintain the corporate A.M.T. and trim, but not end, the individual A.M.T. and the estate tax.

Still, the bills share much of the same architecture and many core elements. Each would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Each would eliminate deductions for state and local income taxes, nearly double the standard deduction for individual filers, and reduce individual tax rates. Because of those provisions, both bills are projected to cut taxes initially for the bulk of middle-class taxpayers, yet raise them on millions of other middle-class families.

The House bill would preserve a deduction for up to $10,000 a year in state and local property taxes. The Senate bill would, too, thanks to a last-minute change that helped gain the support of Senator Susan Collins of Maine.

Mr. Trump, after insisting for weeks that the top corporate rate be cut to 20 percent, signaled on Saturday that it could wind up being a little higher — 22 percent. “It could be 22 when it comes out, but it could also be 20,” he told reporters outside the White House. “We’ll see what ultimately comes out.”

Such an increase would give Republicans extra revenue to pay for other tax cuts in the overhaul, potentially easing its path to final passage.

Lawmakers and lobbyists will battle furiously over the small details in a consensus bill, but party leaders show little worry that big issues will trip up the plan. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said early Saturday that the House would move “quickly” to a conference committee. House members are planning to return to Washington on Monday, a day earlier than planned, to vote to proceed to conference.

“Now it’s time to take the best of both the House and Senate bills, make them even stronger in a conference committee,” Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release on Saturday, “and finalize one piece of legislation that will dramatically improve the lives of Americans for generations to come.”

After the Senate vote, some ebullient Republicans seemed to hint that a conference might not even be necessary. “We’ll see,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, when asked if he thought the House might just take up the Senate’s bill.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, suggested that such a move by House Republicans was possible, but said, “That’ll be a question for House leadership.” A senior administration official, however, said on Friday night that that was not likely to happen.

If Republicans do go to conference, the House and the Senate would each need to vote again to pass the package that resulted from those negotiations, before sending the bill to Mr. Trump. If the House were to simply approve the Senate bill, it would head to Mr. Trump straight away.

Unable to stop or stall the bill, because Republicans are employing a process that allows them to bypass a legislative filibuster, Democrats were left to fume about the tax plan and the process by which it was speeding toward approval.

Democrats charged that the Senate bill had been loaded with last-minute favors for the rich and the well-connected at the expense of the middle class, and complained that the text of the bill had been released only hours before the vote, with handwritten changes scrawled in the margins. Lobbyists saw a list detailing the changes before they did, the Democrats said.

“Is this really how the Republicans are going to rewrite the tax code?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, asked in a floor speech before the vote. “Scrawled like something on the back of a napkin? Behind closed doors? With the help of K Street lobbyists? If that’s not a recipe for swindling the middle class and loosening loopholes for the wealthy, I don’t know what is.”

As a group, Democrats seemed resigned to the fact that there was little they could do to stop the tax overhaul from being enacted.

“My sense is they may have a conference in name only,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said after the vote.

But Mr. Wyden predicted that Republicans would eventually regret their victory. “The American people are going to be stunned when they see what’s really in this,” he said.","Few Hurdles Left, G.O.P.

He plays a fictionalized version of himself, a time-traveling doppelgänger and a simpering, squeaky-voiced Bulgarian factory worker.

It’s a remarkable turnaround for this Belgian-born actor, who became a bankable action star in the 1980s and ’90s in films directed by some of Hong Kong’s greatest action directors, then watched as personal troubles — an addiction to cocaine, contentious divorces — scuttled his career.

Rather than dodge the actor’s sometimes rocky past, the series lovingly mocks it. Throughout the six-part series, references are sprinkled to Van Damme films and life stories from the past, including parodies of training sequences and nods to his years filming in places like Bulgaria and China.

Dave Callaham, the creator and showrunner, and a longtime aficionado of Mr. Van Damme’s work, leapt when he heard, in 2014, that Scott Free Productions, Ridley Scott’s company behind TV shows like “The Good Wife” and “The Man in the High Castle” (and films like “Blade Runner 2049,” “Murder on the Orient Express” and “The Martian”), was trying to come up with a TV series for the action star. A writer on “Godzilla” and “The Expendables,” Mr. Callaham knew action, but he had more than just another Van Damme martial arts flick in mind. He envisioned something high-concept, like the critically acclaimed 2008 Belgian film “JCVD,” which starred Mr. Van Damme playing himself as an unwitting participant in a post office robbery.

“I told them I’d like to play with the notions of who he is and what he represents in the culture,” Mr. Callaham said. “He was my favorite actor growing up, so I wanted to talk about the ups and downs of his career, and to do something that involved all those different worlds. And they said, great, we don’t know what you’re talking about.”

But Mr. Callaham was very apprehensive about how Mr. Van Damme would react when he pitched the show. “I didn’t know J.C. personally, and I didn’t know what his appetite would be for making fun of himself,” he said. “A lot of those guys, those ’80s guys especially, are not open to that.”

And the treatment he created for Scott Free was, as he recalled, “insane.” (It opened with Mr. Van Damme as a forgotten sad sack who played Frisbee golf to stay in shape.) Without Mr. Callaham’s knowledge, the folks at Scott Free sent the treatment to Mr. Van Damme, who loved it.

A meeting was set up, but Mr. Callaham was still nervous about meeting his lifelong hero. As a self-described “tiny kid” growing up in the ’80s, during the era of Arnold and Hulk Hogan, Mr. Callaham had idolized the smaller, speedier action star, and now he was finally going to meet him. “I had a panic attack,” he recalled. “I locked myself in the bathroom at Scott Free and refused to come out.”

He needn’t have worried. “J.C. was really friendly and nice,” he said. “He was aware of my credits, so he mainly wanted to ask me questions about ‘Godzilla.’ He had a lot of questions about ‘Godzilla.’”

With the new show, Mr. Van Damme, a native French speaker, has no problem mocking his image. Dressed in a black “Brussels, Belgium” T-shirt and jeans, he spoke candidly about his early days in Hollywood trying to convince casting agents that he spoke English (“it was a catastrophe”) and about past roles. “I made 40-plus movies where you see me with a gun and that one neutral face,” he said.

The series riffs on themes from those films, including time travel (the 1994 cult classic “Timecop”) and doppelgängers (“Double Impact,” from 1991), and spoofs the “anything for a buck” nature of Hollywood action films. In “Huck,” the show’s film within a film, the hero is a brawling superpatriot in a straw hat (“I pledge allegiance to kicking ass,” he says), Tom Sawyer is a woman (and Huck’s lover), and Huck’s runaway slave pal is changed from African-American to Chinese mid-production, in a shameless scheme to exploit the Asian market.

The series also shows the softer side of Mr. Van Damme, who, in the film (and, one could argue, in life) is often his own worst enemy. “I feel like he’s on this real razor’s edge between wanting to be very big and outgoing, and wanting to really keep to himself and be very private,” said Kat Foster (“Weeds”), who plays his black ops sidekick and ex-girlfriend. “I think ‘J.C.V.J.’ is a homage to the quieter parts of him, the parts of him that he prefers to hide.”

As he awaits the international reaction to the show (which is set to air in more than 200 countries and territories), Mr. Van Damme is keeping busy on a variety of projects. He’s helping train mixed martial arts fighters (in the past, he’s worked with the Diaz Brothers and UFC champion Georges St-Pierre) and working to create a sanctuary for endangered animals in Australia. But he’s most excited about the series, which he calls the highlight of his year, and which will have its world premiere on Dec. 12 at the Grand Rex theater in Paris.

“When I lost my ‘Timecop’ fame because of some stupidity, and then I didn’t do any theatrical film for nine, 10 years except ‘Expendables 2,’ I said to my mother, before you go, mama, I’m gonna make sure I’m back in theaters, and we’ll have a big premiere in Paris,” he said. “And now it’s happening.

The economic turmoil has put families — poor and affluent alike — at the intersection of some very tough choices, bred a stressful uncertainty about the course of any given day and turned the most basic tasks into feats of endurance.

“Something so simple as taking money out of a bank machine or buying a coffee or taking a taxi has become a race for survival,” Mr. Sandoval said.

Some in Venezuela have started equating the nation’s travails to a country during wartime. But the deterioration has in some ways been less dramatic and more insidious.

At first glance the severity of the situation might not be immediately obvious to a newcomer. Viewed from a certain remove, Caracas may seem like any other capital in the developing world: streets crowded with traffic, people hustling to work, shops open and doing business.

But on closer inspection, those impressions quickly fall away to reveal a society falling apart, and people struggling to hold their lives together and make it through the day.

The administration of President Nicolás Maduro stopped publishing inflation data long ago. But the opposition-controlled National Assembly, whose economic data is generally in line with those of private economists, said that the inflation rate hit 45.5 percent in October, up from 36.3 percent the month before, putting Venezuela on the statistical doorstep of hyperinflation, commonly regarded as 50 percent per month or higher.

But hyperinflationary conditions have already existed, economists say, particularly as prices on some key goods and services have risen by more than 50 percent month over month, putting them out of reach of an increasing number of people.

The stress and the costs are rendered most starkly among the poor, where margins of survival are measured in pennies.

For nearly two decades, Beatríz, 53, worked as a nurse in Caracas, a career she loved. Even though she earned only slightly more than minimum wage, she made enough to make ends meet for her and her five children.

“Food was never an issue,” said Beatríz, who, like some others interviewed for this article, asked that her full name be withheld for fear that she would be persecuted by the Maduro administration for criticizing the economic situation.

Several years ago, Beatríz was laid off from her job as the economy worsened, and she found work as the staff cleaner in the Caracas office of an international advertising firm.

She now makes about what she did as a nurse, yet it is no longer enough to cover her family’s basic needs, even though her household has shrunk to only three people: herself, a son and her ailing 76-year-old mother.","In a Venezuela Ravaged by Inflation, ‘a Race for Survival’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/americas/venezuela-nicholas-maduro-inflation-hyperinflation.html

Constructor Notes

Bruce Haight: I first submitted this puzzle in January of 2014. Anna Shechtman [Will Shortz’s assistant at the time] wrote back: “Will is intrigued by your AT THE DROP OF A HAT mini-themed 15x, whose strange symmetry effectively makes the black squares look like “dropping” hats. Assuming this was your intention, though, Will is not certain that MEXICAN HAT DANCE makes much sense as your second theme entry.” This was a bit embarrassing, and I switched to HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT for the next couple of submissions, which failed for lack of sparkling fill. I decided to bring in a hired gun, and David Steinberg rode in with his big white hat and saved the day. He didn’t just blindly start working on better fill though; he first suggested we switch to FLIPPING ONES LID as the second theme entry and he then talked me into adding two blocks. This made the visual slightly less dramatic than my fish puzzle, but moving from 66 words to 70 made it way easier to come up with good fill. David is a master grid technician and I believe he has the most precisely scored word list on the planet, and he also has interned with Will and Joel for much of the past two summers. David has a great sense of humor too, so he is just fun to work with all around. You might think that with my age being 64 and David’s age being 20 this would be close to a record for biggest gap, but he did one with Bernice Gordon when she was 100 and he was 17. David turns 21 on the day this puzzle is published and I think he has quite a future ahead of him. Happy birthday, David! David Steinberg: Always a pleasure to work with Bruce Haight/Mr. Grid Art. I fell in love with the hat concept at first sight, though boy, was that grid difficult to work with, given the constraints of the hats and the two 15s! The final product took many back-and-forths, so even if my word list is more fine-tuned than Bruce’s (which is a big if), there’s no way this would have turned out as well without his input every step of the way. Keep your eye out for more from us in the coming months.

Thanks for getting our weekend started off, Mr. Haight and Mr. Steinberg.

But the bigger, thornier question is where all these new residences will go, and how hard neighbors will try to prevent them. The Haskell Street fight shows why passing laws is one thing and building is another, but also gives a glimpse of what the denser neighborhoods of the future might look like — and why lots of little buildings are more important than a few skyscrapers.

Kurt’s Tomatoes

The 1300 block of Haskell Street sits in a kind of transition zone between the taller buildings in downtown Berkeley and the low-rise homes scattered through the eastern hills. The neighborhood has a number of single-family homes, and the street is quiet and quasi-suburban, but there are also apartment buildings and backyard cottages that nod to the city’s denser core.

A little under three years ago, a contractor named Christian Szilagy bought the property and presented the city with a proposal to demolish the house and replace it with three skinny and rectangular homes that would extend through the lot. Each would have one parking spot, a garden and about 1,500 square feet of living space.

The neighbors hated it. The public discussion began when Matthew Baran, the project architect, convened a meeting with 20 or so neighbors in the home’s backyard. A mediator joined him and later filed a three-sentence report to the city: “The applicant described the project. Not a single neighbor had anything positive to say about it. No further meetings were scheduled.”

Not in My Backyard In Berkeley, a proposal to demolish a single-family residence and replace it with three smaller units has met with disapproval from neighborhood residents. How the proposed three-unit project would sit on the 50-by-150-foot Haskell Street lot, compared with the existing house and garage: EXISTING STRUCTURES PROPOSED STRUCTURES 50 FT. 50 FT. Building 1 Garage Building 2 150 FT. 150 FT. Residence Building 3 Drive EXISTING STRUCTURES 150 FT. Drive Garage Residence 50 FT. PROPOSED STRUCTURES 150 FT. 50 FT. Building 2 Building 1 Building 3

On paper, at least, there was nothing wrong with the proposal. The city’s zoning code designates the area as “R2-A,” or a mixed-density area with apartments as well as houses.

Berkeley’s planning staff recommended approval. But as neighbors wrote letters, called the city and showed up at meetings holding signs that said “Protect Our Community” and “Reject 1310 Haskell Permit!,” the project quickly became politicized.

One focal point was Kurt Caudle’s garden. Mr. Caudle is a brewpub manager who lives in a small house on the back side of Ms. Trew’s property (that lot has two homes, or one fewer than was proposed next door). Just outside his back door sits an oasis from the city: a quiet garden where he has a small Buddha statue and grows tomatoes, squash and greens in raised beds that he built.

In letters and at city meetings, Mr. Caudle complained that the homes would obstruct sunlight and imperil the garden “on which I and my neighbors depend for food.” Sophie Hahn, a member of the city’s Zoning Adjustments Board who now sits on the City Council, was sympathetic.

“When you completely shadow all of the open space,” Ms. Hahn said during a hearing, “you really impact the ability for anybody to possibly grow food in this community.”

Photo

The debate was easy to caricature, a textbook example of what housing advocates are talking about when they decry the not-in-my-backyard, or Nimby, attitude. Reality is more nuanced. As cities become magnets for high-paying jobs and corporate headquarters, there has been a backlash of anti-development sentiment and a push for protections like rent control.

Home prices in the ZIP code surrounding the 1300 block of Haskell Street have just about doubled over the past five years, to an average of about $900,000, according to Zillow. Those numbers are terrifying to people like L.C. Stephens, 67, who is retired from the state corrections department.

Mr. Stephens pays $1,600 to live in a modest apartment complex that was built in 1963 and sits just a few lots down from the project site. His building was recently purchased by investors and is being painted and renovated. The rehabilitated units go for $2,400 and up.

“People are getting priced out,” he said. “It’s not about ‘We need more housing.’ Yeah, we can use it, but it needs to be affordable.”

Photo

The proposed homes are not that. They are estimated to sell for around $1 million. But this is an illustration of the economist’s argument that more housing will lower prices. The cost of a rehabilitated single-family home in the area — which is what many of the neighbors preferred to see on the lot — runs to $1.4 million or more.

Even so, economics is not politics. The argument that quiet, low-slung neighborhoods have to change to keep everyone from being priced out is never going to be a political winner. When the Haskell Street proposal came up for a vote, Jesse Arreguin, who was then a city councilman but is now the mayor of Berkeley, gave a “no” vote that sounded like a campaign speech.

“This issue is bigger than Haskell Street,” Mr. Arreguin said. “This project sets a precedent for what I believe is out-of-scale development that will compromise the quality of life and character of our neighborhoods throughout the city of Berkeley.”

The city’s denial won applause from the crowd. It also drew a lawsuit.

Making It Easier to Sue

Not-in-my-backyard activism has been a fixture of California for long enough that the state already has a law about it. In 1982, Mr. Brown, during his first run as governor, signed the Housing Accountability Act, colloquially known as the “anti-Nimby law.”

The law bars cities from stopping developments that meet local zoning codes. In other words, it’s illegal for cities to ignore their own housing laws. The act is rarely invoked, however, because developers don’t want to sue cities for fear it will anger city councils and make it harder for them to gain approval for other developments.

Lately, the law has become a tool for activists. Two years ago, Sonja Trauss, who leads a group called the Bay Area Renters’ Federation and is running for a seat on San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, sued Lafayette, a nearby suburb, for violating the Housing Accountability Act, and settled out of court.

Shortly after Berkeley denied the Haskell Street permit, Ms. Trauss sued the city — and won.

Photo

Berkeley agreed to give the project a new hearing and consider the Housing Accountability Act when reviewing future development. Neighbors, still incensed, continued to put pressure on the city to deny it. And the city did, this time refusing a demolition permit.

Ms. Trauss sued again, and in July a Superior Court judge for Alameda County ordered the city to issue the permit.

“Organizing alone doesn’t get us out of the crisis,” said Ryan J. Patterson, Ms. Trauss’s lawyer and a partner at Zacks, Freedman & Patterson in San Francisco. “You have to have a fist people fear.”

This almost certainly marks the beginning of a trend. Right about the time Ms. Trauss sued Berkeley, Mr. Hanlon started raising money for California Yimby. He found traction in the local technology industry, whose growth is partly responsible for the Bay Area’s housing crunch but whose employees are similarly discouraged by the astronomical rents.

Nat Friedman, a serial entrepreneur who became a vice president at Microsoft after selling his company to the software giant last year, has helped California Yimby raise close to $1 million for its efforts to lobby the state on housing issues.

“The smaller the unit of government, the harder it is to solve this problem,” Mr. Friedman said.

Mr. Hanlon’s first project was to push for a law that would make it easier to sue cities under the Housing Accountability Act. The result was S.B. 167, a bill written by Nancy Skinner, Berkeley’s state senator and a former member of the City Council. In addition to raising the legal burden of proof for cities to deny new housing projects, the bill makes the suits more expensive to defend by requiring cities that lose to pay the other side’s lawyers’ fees.

“What’s frustrating for anybody trying to build housing is that they try to play by the rules and they still get told ‘no,’” Ms. Skinner said.

Photo

Ms. Skinner’s law takes effect next year, so the long-term impact is unclear. But just a few weeks before it was signed, the Zoning Adjustments Board had another contentious housing project.

Neighbors had familiar complaints: The homes were too tall, had long shadows, and more residents would make it harder to find parking. The board’s chairman responded that he understood the concerns but couldn’t risk another lawsuit.

California isn’t going to solve its housing problem in the courts. But the basic idea — big-footing local government so that cities have a harder time blocking development — is central to the solutions that the state is pursuing.

This is a state of great ambition. It wants to lead the country on actions to reduce carbon emissions, and has enacted legislation mandating a $15 minimum wage by 2022. But housing is undermining all of it.

Even with a growing economy and its efforts to raise wages, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation, with one in five residents living in poverty, once housing costs are taken into account. And plans to reduce carbon emissions are being undermined by high home prices that are pushing people farther and farther from work.

In a brief speech before signing the recent package of housing bills, Mr. Brown talked about how yesterday’s best intentions become today’s problems. California cities have some of the nation’s strictest building regulations, and measures to do things like encourage energy efficiency and enhance neighborhood aesthetics eventually become regulatory overreach.

“City and state people did all this good stuff,” Mr. Brown said to a crowd of legislators. “But, as I always say, too many goods create a bad.”",The Great American Single-Family Home Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/business/economy/single-family-home.html

If a science book can be subversive and feminist and change the way we look at our own bodies — but also be mostly about birds — this is it. Prum, an ornithologist, mounts a defense of Darwin’s second, largely overlooked theory of sexual selection. Darwin believed that, in addition to evolving to adapt to the environment, some other force must be at work shaping the species: the aesthetic mating choices made largely by the females. Prum wants subjectivity and the desire for beauty to be part of our understanding of how evolution works.

Her illness, it turns out, worked in her favor. She looked slightly damp and deranged the entire time. “I had to take off my shoes at one point because I was sweating so much,” she told me. “It was a mess. And Amy kept stopping me to tell me to powder my face. I think I may have had a small stroke? I literally don’t remember a single moment of it.”

Amy Sherman-Palladino later told me over the phone that she has a different memory of Brosnahan’s audition. “She blew in like a hurricane,” she said. “Nothing shook. Her pages didn’t shake, her hands didn’t shake. There was literally no fear.” Daniel Palladino added that, while they knew making actresses perform a stand-up set to a cold room was “sadistic,” they had to find someone who could wisecrack under pressure.

Brosnahan has been an actress on the cusp for a decade — always just about to break out, about to be the chosen one. It’s not that she hasn’t been noticed. When she was 21 and about to graduate from N.Y.U., she was cast on Netflix’s first series, “House of Cards,” as Rachel Posner, a high-end escort in Washington who sleeps with a congressman and then is paid off to stay quiet. The role was originally intended for someone older, and Brosnahan was supposed to act in only two episodes. “They told me I was too young and that I should wear a tighter dress because they had to believe I was a lot older than I was,” she told me. “I thought, Oh, God, I definitely didn’t get this, and they are going to figure out I’m a fraud.”

Not only did she get it, but her chemistry with Michael Kelly, who played the presidential chief of staff assigned to handle Posner and who falls for her in the process, was so undeniable that the creators wrote her character from a five-line role into eight episodes in the second season, and then one more episode, in the third, that earned her an Emmy nomination. “Michael used to call my agent after we had scenes together and tell him how much he enjoyed working with me,” she told me.

We were walking underneath a giant aqueduct. Brosnahan is petite and put together; that afternoon, she was wearing a striped T-shirt with a fitted motorcycle jacket and a demure pair of black penny loafers. She looked like a preppy mime. For our first meeting, she wanted to see the medieval art at the Cloisters, a short trip north of her apartment in Manhattan, but we both agreed that the day was too warm to spend among dusty tapestries. Instead, she wanted to stroll along the Hudson through the wildflowers. “I really credit Michael as being a huge reason I continued on that show,” she said. There was a fierceness to Brosnahan in the role; even though she was young, she played a political Fantine who was already weathered and wry, as disgusted by the grubby hands of lobbyists as their detractors on the Hill.

Her character met a brutal end — buried somewhere in the wilderness for knowing too much — but by then Brosnahan already had another TV job. She played Abby Isaacs, the young wife of a physicist in the underrated period drama “Manhattan,” about the creation of the atomic bomb. All red lipstick and pin curls and wifely duties, Abby was a hint at what Brosnahan could do with a part like Midge: another woman who loses her innocence, in this case a newcomer to Los Alamos who must slowly come to understand that her husband might help blow up the world. Lila Byock, one of the show’s writers, told me: “I don’t think Rachel ever gave a bad take. And I’m not being hyperbolic. We would watch takes, and it was like, holy [expletive], who is this person? She was about a year older than the actress who was playing a teenager on our show, but it was almost like she walked in fully formed.”

Brosnahan was born in Milwaukee but raised in Highland Park, Ill., outside Chicago. Her father worked in children’s publishing, and her mother, an import from Britain (“she still says ‘sauce’ like sohs”), stayed home to raise Brosnahan and her two siblings. The family hobby was sports. Brosnahan was on the wrestling and lacrosse teams, and she was also a certified snowboarding instructor, which in Chicago is apparently a big deal. She started acting in kindergarten plays and never lost the taste for it but says that her parents were skeptical when she told them that she wanted to pursue it seriously. “They were like, hold the phone,” she said. “My dad said, you know, if you want to do it, then prove it. And I started saving money for acting classes.” She went to N.Y.U. to study drama but started booking roles so quickly — guest spots on “In Treatment,” “The Good Wife” and “CSI: Miami,” roles in indie films — that she had to have “many dinners” with her father just to assure him that she was attending enough classes to be able to graduate.

Until Midge, Brosnahan played almost solely dramatic roles. That’s where she feels most comfortable, most in control; as she has discovered, telling jokes involves a level of vulnerability far beyond crying on camera. Luckily, the women whom Sherman-Palladino and Palladino write are all about taut sentences and tight timing; there is nothing elastic about them. Their loose, swingy tempo is entirely preplanned, down to the word (“a monstrous amount of material, and you have to have it down cold,” Brosnahan said). While this rigor may not have worked for a seasoned comedian, someone accustomed to improvisation, Brosnahan took to the constraints right away. She found the bounce inside Midge’s hardness; she snaps the end of her sentences like bubble gum.

Sherman-Palladino’s own father, Don Sherman, was a comic right out of the borscht-belt old school. After he died in 2012, she started to think about how she might honor his legacy by telling stories about his world — Lenny Bruce would come by the house when she was a child, and though her family lived in L.A. by then, she grew up hearing war stories about the New York stand-up scene. She began to think about setting something in the world her father rattled around in, the dank Village clubs of the ’60s. But instead of following a grizzled comic through the haze of two-drink minimums and chance encounters with Jack Paar, she decided to showcase a much less examined life: that of a normal woman, alone under the hot lights, slinging zingers for pay.

It is this belief in Midge’s normalcy — that she was just like every other wife putting a steak dinner on the table before she was not — that ultimately makes her a radical character for television right now. Her comedy doesn’t come from a deep well of insecurity; it comes from a brazen moxie that she cannot explain and never realized had a viable outlet until she stepped onstage. At this turbulent moment in show business, when many men — especially comics — who were praised and protected as icons are being revealed as harassers, creeps and criminals, what we thought of as a linear narrative of progress is being rewritten. We are seeing how many talented women were forced to diminish themselves or give up in the face of misogyny, particularly in comedy, where being a successful woman is so often tied to making the boys in power laugh.

“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” has a swirling, magical-realism quality to it. It begins with a wedding — Midge and Joel’s — at which, naturally, Midge insists on giving her own toast. She is a woman who has enjoyed every privilege: couture clothes, the full spread at Zabar’s fish counter, a palatial apartment in her parents’ building. One striking scene from the pilot follows Midge as she does her nightly beauty routine, waking up twice in the middle of the night, once to remove her makeup and again to put it back on, so that her husband always wakes up to a perfectly done face. When Joel leaves Midge, the shock is seismic. She has never had to work, or even struggle with her own self-image. This is why her revelations are so primed for comedy: She is a woman who fully believed she deserved the moon, and when her perfect facade disappears, she’s apoplectic and confused and ready to rant.

Whenever Midge’s jokes really hit, it is joyful and electric to watch. Women have the right to claim, and reclaim, a place in stand-up comedy history. There were always women working the circuit, even on the borscht belt — like the 1960s club regular Belle Barth, who sold millions of comedy records. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” provides a vehicle through which to engage and recover their stories all over again. Because Midge doesn’t start out on a crusade, she almost smuggles progress into the world; like many women navigating midcentury lives, her success is mounted like an undercover operation.

“What I love about Midge is that she is so not a feminist,” Brosnahan told me. “She’s a creature of her time.” Midge Maisel is doing what she needs to do to get ahead in a man’s world, which is its own kind of quiet, lesser-told revolt. “What she is,” Brosnahan continued, “is curious. She’s insatiable. If she doesn’t know things, she wants to know them. And she doesn’t know any other way than forward.”

The “Maisel” set sits on a cavernous soundstage at Steiner Studios, in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Because Amazon ordered two seasons (the streaming service’s first immediate renewal, based on the strength of the pilot alone), the production designer Bill Groom’s intricate replicas of 1950s New York will stay in place until next spring, when “Maisel” goes back into production. Sherman-Palladino and Palladino wanted to shoot on location as much as possible, but so little of the midcentury metropolis remains intact. The crew hung a scrim the length of a city block painted with apartment buildings at night, each glowing window illuminating a different urban tableau. There is one closed corner of the set, strictly off-limits to outsiders: the box that houses the Gaslight Café. The creators don’t want strangers to watch while Brosnahan is doing stand-up. The only people allowed in are the extras in beatnik dress and a handful of crew members. In early episodes, for sound-editing purposes, she had to deliver her act to a silent crowd.

I watched Brosnahan film a domestic scene from the seventh episode, in which she and her pert platinum friend, Imogene, played by Bailey De Young, are stuffing goody bags for a children’s birthday party inside her parents’ posh apartment. The scene was simple enough: Sort toys into bags while gossiping about Midge and Joel’s separation. But the number of props was overwhelming. There were dozens of period-appropriate trinkets — Tiny Tina baby carriages, Silly Putty, Bazooka Joe — and the women had to place them into each bag in a precise order, all while firing off rapid, breathless dialogue. It was the final shot of the night, and Brosnahan had already been cinched into a corset for six hours. Her brain was mush, she told me, “because we’d already shot 40 pages of dialogue that week,” but she attacked the scene with laser intensity as the two began shuffling knickknacks around.

“Wait, there’s already gum in here,” Brosnahan, as Midge, said, her forehead crinkling.

“I put it in there,” De Young said, playing Imogene slightly ditsy.

“I’m doing gum.”

“I thought you were doing candy cigarettes.”

“Starting over,” Brosnahan sighs, dumping out the gift bags with a loud clatter onto the table.

With each take, the two sped up the lines, hands flying. Speak, sigh, pour, speak, sigh, pour, faster and faster. Brosnahan pounced on her lines like a whizzing metronome. Midge is the kind of woman who sets a blistering tempo and waits for the rest of the world to catch up.",Rachel Brosnahan’s Comic Timing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/rachel-brosnahans-comic-timing.html

The Saudi coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, accuses Iran of trying to expand its influence into Arab countries, including Yemen, which shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, by aligning with the Houthis.

The coalition has targeted the Houthi rebels with deadly airstrikes. The Houthis, in turn, have launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Saudi territories, inflicting little damage but causing anxiety among Gulf monarchs, who have suspected cooperation between the rebels and Iran and Hezbollah.

The rebels’ claim of an attack on a nuclear power plant also comes days after Israel said it had destroyed an Iranian base near the Syrian city of al-Qiswa, southwest of Damascus, on Friday.

It is unclear if there were any casualties, since the base had not been completed. There has been no official Iranian reaction. Israel also has not commented on the reports. But it previously acknowledged carrying out repeated air and missile strikes in Syria since the beginning of the war six years ago, to stop arms deliveries to Hezbollah.

On Sunday, an Iranian analyst, Hamidreza Taraghi, who has close ties to Iran’s leaders, denied any the country had links to the missile attack claimed by the Yemen rebels.

“We have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Taraghi said. “The Houthis are very capable of hitting targets without our assistance.”

But Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia, and its allies insist that Iran has provided the Houthis with such weaponry and say that the rebels are taking commands from Tehran.

The Yemen rebels’ claim about striking a target in Abu Dhabi comes amid heavy fighting in Yemen’s capital, Sana, between the Shiite Houthi rebels and some of their former allies, who are led by former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.

Mr. Saleh, who stepped down in 2011 after a mass uprising against his 33 years in office, but he formed an alliance with the Houthis. Since then, fractures have emerged between the former leader and the rebels, exacerbating the crisis.

In a televised speech on Saturday, Mr. Saleh blamed the Houthis’ “idiocy” for the war in Yemen and declared that he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the coalition if it stopped the attacks on his country.

“I call upon the brothers in neighboring states and the alliance to stop their aggression, lift the siege, open the airports and allow food aid and the saving of the wounded and we will turn a new page by virtue of our neighborliness,” Mr. Saleh said.

In a statement carried by the Saudi-owned news outlet Al-Hadath, the coalition appeared to welcome Mr. Saleh’s remarks, saying it was “confident of the will of the leaders and sons” of Mr. Saleh’s political party to return to the fold.

Such a move by Mr. Saleh could pave the way to end the war, which has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe, unleashing signs of famine and outbreaks of cholera.

The apparent shift came as Mr. Saleh’s supporters battled Houthi fighters for a fourth day in the capital. A senior security officer at the Ministry of Interior in Sana said about 80 people have died and at least 140 more have been injured since fighting broke out.

Ambition is the name of the game on this week’s list of recommended books. “Ramp Hollow” tells the centuries-long story of Appalachia. A biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, the author of “Little House on the Prairie,” doubles as a sweeping work of Western American history. John Banville attempts no less than channeling Henry James, in a sequel to “The Portrait of a Lady.” With a month left to go before New Year’s resolutions, the lesson to take from these authors might be: Aim high.

RAMP HOLLOW: The Ordeal of Appalachia, by Steven Stoll. (Hill and Wang, $30.) Stoll’s book is a powerful and outrage-making analysis of the forces, over centuries, that have shaped Appalachia. “ ‘Ramp Hollow’ is not ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ redux,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. Stoll “does not relate his own story, and his book is not especially warm to the touch. But as economic history it is gravid and well made.”

THE WATER WILL COME: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World, by Jeff Goodell. (Little, Brown, $28.) In “The Water Will Come,” Goodell, whose previous books include “Big Coal” and “How to Cool the Planet,” visits cities around the globe in peril because of climate change. “After this year’s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, ‘The Water Will Come’ is depressingly well-timed,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes, “though I’m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on.”

THE LOVER, WARTIME NOTEBOOKS and PRACTICALITIES, by Marguerite Duras. (Everyman’s Library, $30.) In this collection of three books, our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “We get as complete a portrait as we can hope for: the writer the world knows (‘The Lover’ was a global best seller); the one performing her public role (she’s very much the literary grande dame in the chatty essays in ‘Practicalities’); and the one at work, spurring herself on in notebooks that an editor called Duras’s ‘workshop, gymnasium, kitchen, treasure chest.’ ”

Azu Nwagbogu, the festival’s founder and director, spoke with James Estrin about photography in Africa. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

What is your goal with the Lagos photo festival?

A.

I feel like photography has the power to make us understand the world better and to create empathy. So the goal is to have more visual storytellers telling more new stories to enable us to imagine a newer, better, richer, more prosperous, more safe, more empowered Africa.

In the past, the stories were told to create pity, and pity is an emotion that is not sustainable, that is easily dismissed, that does not allow us to understand or appreciate how to engage in that community. You just look away. And we are not trying to make people look away, we are trying to make people understand and invite them to share and to be part of that story.

Q.

How did you put together this year’s festival?

A.

The theme of the festival is Regimes of Truth. We are exploring a further understanding of the post-truth society that we live in. Now we are either inundated with so much information, or we have constructed another reality of what the truth is.

So it’s really looking at the way photography, the media and artists explore these notions of what is true and what is real. Because photography was founded on the science of observation, and it has always flattered itself to be a representative or an arbiter of truth.

In contemporary society, we now know that an image can be very deceptive and it can be propaganda. But at the same time we understand that visual language is becoming more decipherable by many more people, and that’s one of the reasons why I feel Africa is getting a lot of attention, mainly because of photography.

Photography created a pejorative view of the continent. Photography is also able to emancipate the impression that we have of Africa.

We have some really interesting work. Samuel Fosso’s “Black Pope” (Slide 7) explores the way religion and its symbols and objects that are used to create the narrative of a papal figure are so removed from the African context and culture that it almost promotes this idea of whiteness and white supremacy. In the history of the papacy, there has never been a black pope, while today the greatest number of Roman Catholics is actually in Africa.

Q.

In the 19th century, photography was thought to be scientifically accurate. Photojournalism still holds the conceit that one can be accurate in a sense. In a “post-truth” society, what does truth mean in relation to photography?

A.

I think through photography, especially photojournalism, we can sometimes establish the facts. When you have the facts, you can build on them and create the architecture that becomes the truth of the story.

Photojournalism is still very important in establishing the facts. How many people died, how many people traveled, who were the people in the room at that time. Photography can still do this. But to tell the story, you need to build a truth. But the truth is complex and the truth is something that we all search for. So I think that is always the balance between photography and visual culture.

Photo

Q.

How do you see the history of photography in Africa, and what is the role of photography in Africa today?

A.

It was photography that was used to create a dominant view for the colonizer over the Africans. And that is all about the colonizer with his hand over objects, or over his subjects. And it’s always about power, domination, control. So that’s really been the history of photography on the continent. It’s always been completely based on propaganda.

When we reflect on this in contemporary times, we want to reverse that.

We feel that sometimes we learn more through fiction than through what is considered to be factual. For example, the best information about Russia in the 19th century, when there was a lot of censorship, comes through fiction. So for us, it’s always finding that dance between the fictional and the factual. And also reclaiming African identity, which is really important to us.

We feel like we can’t use one approach. We have to adopt both. A lot of the fictive images seem to get more attention, but we have always had a strong documentary effort in the festivals.

Q.

Other than by exhibiting the stories, how do you build a culture and community of photographers to tell them? Or is that too elitist?

A.

No, I think that’s a mission of the festival. It’s always about building a community that has ownership, passion, and a feeling of adventure and camaraderie. We want to shape the way the stories that relate to Africa are told, and I think that’s really the most important thing that we can achieve. And that’s by shaping and expanding the community of visual storytellers.

One of the legacies of colonial intervention is a fragmentation of community. And where you have fragmentation of community it becomes harder to come together to grow.

We have conventional African storytellers trying to tell stories the way they think the West is interested in seeing the stories. There was not a community to support younger, contemporary visual storytellers on the continent who were trying to find their own voice, trying to find their own language, their own way, their own approach, their own unique, more knowledgeable perspective in telling stories that relate to Africa.

But when you have the community, there is a support for more nuanced, more honest, more true, more representative stories of contemporary Africa.

Q.

I see lot of work from Africa that is more in the art space and employs broader storytelling strategies. Is there a place in the Western media for African photographers? Or do they have to adjust or transform to fit that?

A.

I don’t think they need to transform. I keep hearing people say Africa seems to be in the news, to be hot, to be trending. I think it’s mainly because lots more people are able to tell their own stories and publish their own stories, by themselves, on social media. So that authorship, independent of the mainstream, has generated this interest in the unique voices and stories in Africa.

I don’t think there’s a real need to adapt or to change to a more understandable or decipherable visual language that the West is interested in. It’s more about developing an authentic voice and making sure that it’s consistent and coherent.

Q.

How?

A.

My message to practitioners on the continent is we shouldn’t follow Western journalism or art institutions, which are dominated by white males. Rather, we should innovate and find ways to be more representative, to include other voices. Media houses on the continent have to make sure they have as many women as men, and you have to make sure that you have women as editors. If you have enough diversity from the beginning, it makes it easier to make sure that you’re telling stories that are diverse, that are inclusive, that are more all embracing.

It’s really an exciting time on the continent — a lot is happening and a lot can still happen.

Q.

How about social class?

A.

Class is a massive problem in Africa, but the wonderful thing is that because of the communal nature of society, you’re never too far removed from those above and below you.

Class is always an issue in terms of breaking the mold and inviting more people to engage in the wider public discourse. That’s why contemporary art is so important. You come into an artist’s vision in public spaces where you have what I call interdependence — where people can agree or disagree, share ideas, in a very peaceful and a very safe zone with others of all classes. So there is really no need for conflict.

Q.

How are you bringing work to the public?

A.

We curate exhibitions in public spaces, like parks, where people can leave comments in any language about what they feel about the work. The most interesting comments we get are from people who might not feel comfortable in museums or galleries but feel very comfortable in parks.

Photo

Q.

How did you get involved in photography?

A.

Fifteen years ago when I was a writer and a scientist I realized that photography was the most powerful tool for visual storytelling, engagement and emancipation. And once I got into it I never looked back.

Q.

Were you ever a photographer?

A.

Not at all. I was more of a writer and curator. Those were my interests, my passion, so curating and writing is what I did.

Q.

The festival doesn’t only feature photographers who were born in Africa.

A.

Absolutely not. I think it’s really stupid that people sometimes question that. A lot of the work that exists on the continent has been made by photographers from elsewhere.

Sometimes the work is really, really good and meaningful and nuanced and well done, so why shouldn’t we show that? It’s empowering, and also it’s important that the local photographers see themselves as equals with anyone else. So that’s really the strength of the festival, is the fact that we do not isolate.

When it comes to empowering the continent, we do ourselves a disservice by saying, “You are not black enough” or “You are not African enough.” Because Africans go to Europe and improve the culture — evolve the culture, the language, the music, the art, the sport and everything else.

And when the reverse happens, we get scared or anxious about it. As long as we are shaping the narrative and we are not being overrun by the other voices, it’s important to invite many voices because it’s really about your sensibility, not the color of your skin.

But it’s always about work that relates to the continent. I would say that your color of skin is not important.

Photo

Q.

You talk about Africa, but what does Morocco have in common with Ethiopia, or Ghana? What do you mean when you say Africa?

A.

Africa is the most diverse continent on the planet. So our job really is to tell the stories of these various disparate communities. Presenting these wonderful diverse stories makes us richer.

I don’t think that I have one Africa. I’m a Pan-Africanist. I believe the Pan-Africanist approach is so much more interesting, more fun and more empowering, but at the same time we embrace the diversity across the continent because that makes us richer.

Q.

Then what is the commonality? That they were all colonies of Europe?

A.

Absolutely. The colonial history and the legacy have created a post-colonial continent with post-colonial trauma. We have the symptoms of trauma across the continent as a common theme. So I really don’t want to emphasize too much the negative, but people talk about colonization or colonialism as a stain, but it’s better understood as being actually woven into the very fabric of the continent.

Q.

Can that be transformed into something useful or positive?

A.

It must be, because decolonization starts by owning up to the fact that it’s already intricately woven into our DNA. And once you accept that position, then it empowers you to evolve from that.

When we think about art on the continent, the instinct is to look back. And that nostalgia for the past has kept the continent trapped in this loop.

We look back to before the colonialists’ intervention, to the masks, the sculptures, the objects. But we cannot go back to the masks. We love them, we think they’re beautiful and along with the pyramids they are a testament to the ingenuity of the people on the continent. But going back to that is almost like denying the fact that we have evolved and we are learning and we are able to take from the colonialists and shape a new language, shape a new culture. Because culture really is progressive if you want to find your peace, your balance, to feed your mind, to feed your soul in this world.

We want a future. You see the term Afrofuturism everywhere. We curated a show for the festival four years ago about Afrofuturism — Africans imagining a better future for themselves using technologies, many of which were not created on the continent.

So when you talk about colonization, it’s about saying, “We’re going to shape our future now.” And really shape and control every narrative.

You know the story of the hunt is told by the hunter. The lion will always be the victim. If the lion would be able to tell its own story, the story would be different.

People will, it’s true. But as a society we are actually in some serious trouble on the mating-and-propagation front.

When the sexual revolution started, its conservative critics warned it would replace marriage with a divorce-go-round, leave children without fathers, and expose women to more predation than before. Versions of these things happened, but over time various correctives, feminist and conservative, helped mitigate their worst effects. Divorce rates fell, sexual violence diminished, teen sex and pregnancy were reduced. In the last few years, even the out-of-wedlock birthrate has finally stopped climbing.

The cascade of revelations about powerful men is a continuation of this mitigation and correction process. But so far the process has not substituted successful marriages for failing ones, healthy relationships for exploitative ones, new courtship scripts for the ones torn up 50 years ago. Instead as Weinsteinian or Polanskian excesses have been corrected, we’ve increased singlehood, sterility and loneliness. We’ve achieved the goal of fewer divorces by having many fewer marriages. We’ve reduced promiscuity by substituting smartphones and pornography. We’ve leveled off out-of-wedlock births by entering into a major baby bust.

Part of the problem is economic: Everything from student debt to wage stagnation to child-rearing costs has eroded the substructure of the family, and policymakers have been pathetically slow to respond. Last week’s struggle to get the allegedly pro-family Republican Party to include help for parents in its tax reform is a frustrating illustration of the larger problem.

But there is also strong resistance to seeing a failure to unite the sexes and continue the species as a problem. If women are having fewer children, it must be because they want fewer children. (In fact most women want more children than they have.) If there are fewer marriages, they must at least be happier ones. (In fact they aren’t.) If the young are delaying parenthood, it must be that they are pursuing new opportunities and pleasures. (In fact the young seem increasingly medicated and miserable.) If men prefer video games and pornography to relationships, de gustibus non est disputandum.

A useful counterpoint to these assumptions was provided this week by my colleague Norimitsu Onishi, who wrote about the extraordinary loneliness of old age in Japan, a country that has lived with collapsed fertility and strained relations between the sexes for a generation. Japan’s aging, dying, atomized present is one version of our future — and a not-so-distant one, already visible in late-middle-age despair and elder exploitation.

I don’t know what new-old mix of mating rituals and expectations and supports could arrest Japanification. I don’t think either feminism or social conservatism at present have the answer. And I’m sure there is nothing worth saving in the predatory sexual culture currently being put to the torch by victims and journalists.

As The Times reported this week, two of four new ferry lines are already carrying more passengers than had been projected for 2019, and the city is already considering adding new express routes to get commuters to and from their jobs more quickly.

For some longtime residents on the waterfront, the ferry’s success brings a measure of vindication.

“When I first got here, everybody thought I was out of my mind,” said Mayra Mercado, 49, a physician assistant who moved to the western edge of Astoria, Queens, in 2006. “It used to be a very lonely, long walk home,” she said of her 20-minute hike to the N train.

She bought a one-bedroom condo on Vernon Boulevard, a half block from the river, for about $305,000, because she loved the idea of waterfront living. Now, 11 years later, sales data suggest that she could sell her unit for nearly double that price. She isn’t looking to sell, however — partly because she loves the area, but also because nearby two-bedrooms can run close to $1 million.

Ms. Mercado, who lives with her partner, Peter Anderson, 50, a marine biologist, is just a five-minute walk from the new ferry landing, and she takes the ferry twice a week to get to her job in Midtown. (When it is too cold or rainy, she drives.) Since the line opened this summer, some friends have completely sworn off subway rush hour, she said, and use the ferry exclusively.

On board the ferries, commuters cruise the East River with free Wi-Fi and views of the Manhattan skyline. A kiosk serves organic snacks, beer and wine, and matcha green-tea blends that cost $5.25 (credit cards accepted). The 35-minute Astoria loop, which opened in August, connects to Roosevelt Island, Long Island City, 34th Street in Midtown and Wall Street.

“You should see our sunsets, they’re absolutely spectacular,” Ms. Mercado said of the vistas along a placid but gritty swath of former landfill, where swans glide near chain-link fences. Nearby is the Socrates Sculpture Park, a dumpsite-turned-park-space with modernist art that embraces the area’s industrial past.

Even before the ferry arrived, the neighborhood was transforming. Within a 10-minute walk of the ferry landing, there were 38 condo or rental projects, a total of 2,102 units, in the works in November, said Patrick W. Smith, an associate broker with Stribling & Associates. That exceeds the existing inventory of just 30 residential buildings and 1,667 units, he said. And it doesn’t include Halletts Point, a massive rental project by the Durst Organization, which could add some 2,100 additional units, about a quarter of which will be reserved for lower-income renters, by 2022, said Jordan Barowitz, a Durst spokesman.

“The moment they announced the ferry, we bought as many things as we possibly could,” said Brett Harris, a founding partner of AKI Development, which has six projects near the Astoria landing.

Local rezoning that made it possible to build more housing on the mostly commercial waterfront in 2010 brought AKI and others to the area, but the ferry kicked things into high gear, he said. Graffiti House, the seven-story rental AKI completed last year, is fully leased, with all 28 one-bedroom units, which have heated floors and high-end finishes, going for around $3,000 a month. “We thought we were going to get $2,000 to $2,100,” Mr. Harris said.

Evidence of the ferry’s effect can already be seen at other stops along the East River, said Grant Long, senior economist at the real estate site StreetEasy. In an analysis of rentals within a 10-minute walk of the ferry service, rents grew about 1.5 percent faster in the last year than those up to a half-hour away in Astoria, Greenpoint and part of Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. Markets farther south, in Sunset Park and Bay Ridge, showed signs of similar rent growth near the ferry, but there were too few transactions to analyze.

“The difference in rental growth is really striking because it’s uniform,” said Mr. Long of the areas closest to ferry lines. Pricier neighborhoods with more transit options, like Dumbo, Williamsburg and Long Island City, were less affected. Since rents across the city have been largely stagnant, with Brooklyn and Queens averaging just 0.3 percent increases in the last year, the rent growth in these waterfront neighborhoods is telling.

“This is as close to causation as you can get,” Mr. Long said.

In Greenpoint, where rents near the India Street ferry landing were up 1.9 percent, the pier is a work in progress. On a recent weekday morning, cranes and earthmovers sputtered and hummed over the churn of the East River, while construction workers filled the air with colorful language. Two blocks inland, a hip coffee shop served oat milk lattes, but the walk to the ferry landing was still lined with shuttered garage bays and heavy machinery.

The construction crew was working on the Greenpoint, a glassy 40-story rental and condo project opening next year with 603 units, 95 of them condos with prices ranging from $835,000 for a studio to about $3.5 million for a three-bedroom. Sales began in June and more than half of the condos are under contract or reserved, said Jodi Stasse, who is managing sales with Corcoran Sunshine. The bulk of the project, rental apartments, will start leasing in the spring. In exchange for city tax benefits, about 20 percent of the units will be reserved for lower-income tenants.

“Until we’ve also proven the rental market, people are going to be cautious,” said Richard Mack, co-founder of Mack Real Estate Group, one of the developers. Most new projects in the area include rentals, he said, because lenders are still skeptical about the area’s ability to absorb a big supply of condos.

“I think a lot of them are worried about being able to sell a 2,000-unit building all at once,” said Win Brown, an agent with CORE, of developers’ concerns. The building boom has been mostly rental, he said, with eight waterfront towers now approved for Greenpoint, comparable to development in trendier Williamsburg. But the median rent for apartments near the ferry was $2,960 a month, according to StreetEasy — still lower than the $3,411 median near the North Williamsburg ferry stop.

There are signs that parts of the riverfront market may be getting frothy. In October, almost half the new rental buildings in Brooklyn offered concessions, like a period of free rent or discounted broker fees, said Jonathan J. Miller, the New York real estate appraiser. That is a significantly higher number than in Manhattan (where only 34 percent of new towers were offering concessions), which is stoking concerns about oversupply.

“I can’t tell you one building that’s not offering at least a month, if not more” in free rent, said Rebecca Epstein, director of residential leasing for Two Trees Management in Brooklyn. Her firm is handling the Domino Sugar project, the luxury conversion of the waterfront sugar refinery in Williamsburg that will bring 2,800 new units to the area — 25 percent of which will go to lower-income renters — as well as a public square and dog run on the riverfront. The first leg of the project, at 325 Kent Avenue, where prices range from $2,590 a month for a studio to $5,290 for a two-bedroom, is offering one month of free rent to new tenants.

Ms. Epstein, however, said she is not concerned about filling the project. She said that 30 percent of the units at 325 Kent have been leased since late May, and prices have been raised twice. The nearby ferry stop, a short walk from the site, is not new to the neighborhood — regular service was introduced in 2011 — but the reduced fare has made it more appealing to renters from Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn, she said.

Many remain bullish on the Williamsburg waterfront, including some boldface names. Eliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York, who resigned after a sex scandal, is now at the helm of his family’s first ground-up rental project in many years, a few minutes away from the Domino site.

“In my view, that’s all good,” Mr. Spitzer said of the nearby competition. “There will be sufficient demand.”

His three buildings at 416 and 420 Kent Avenue, where prices range from about $2,800 a month for a studio up to about $10,000 a month for a penthouse, will have 857 units, said David Maundrell of Citi Habitats New Development, with about a quarter reserved for lower-income renters.

“It’s evolved more into an everyday amenity,” Todd Lewin, an associate broker with CORE, said of the ferry.

The ferry isn’t driving deals yet, he added, but it is the talk of the town, especially with the impending L train closure. StreetEasy found that 30 percent of the more than 1,000 rentals near a ferry stop were advertising the ferry service, up from 23 percent last year.

Luxury renters are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the ferry expansion and the development it attracts. The riverfront is also home to some of the largest public housing complexes in the city, including the 22-building Astoria Houses in western Queens, built in the 1940s.

Claudia Coger, the president of the resident association, said not much has changed in the 62 years she has lived there. “It’s been a fight to get attention” for the community, she said, where the nearest supermarket for some is 20 blocks away. So she is pleased that Halletts Point, the Durst Organization project that will add 2,100 apartments across the street from her complex, will include a new supermarket and bring retail jobs to the area. “A lot of people in the community don’t think beyond their environment — this opens doors,” she said about the ferry.

“We’ve been a transportation-starved desert,” said Richard Khuzami, president of the Old Astoria Neighborhood Association, which welcomed the ferry.

Still, he said, the development the ferry has attracted has brought mostly studio and one-bedroom rentals, when there is a need for larger apartments: “You want more families in here, and right now, it’s not easy.”

Critics have also pointed out that some of the “affordable” units the city negotiated with developers are far from it. Because of a formula that relies on an area’s median income, some larger low-income units require tenants who make six-figure salaries.

Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for Housing and Economic Development, said that the bulk of the lower-income housing “really does serve people making between $40,000 to $80,000.” Between 25 and 30 percent of all new units on the waterfront, she said, would be set aside for that purpose.

Others find the changes unwelcome. Lillie Marshall, president of the Red Hook West tenant association, a large public housing complex, said the ferry benefits locals, but the ubiquitous Citi Bike racks that sprang up around the pier take away parking from residents who drive to work. “We don’t need that garbage,” she said.

And the ferry rollout has been far from perfect. A number of ferries have been pulled for repairs, said Stephanie Báez, an EDC spokeswoman, and this week a Rockaway-bound ferry was evacuated after it struck a submerged object. No injuries were reported.

The problems haven’t deterred some longtime straphangers. Stephanie Ebeyer-Verdirame, 42, an interior designer born and raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, takes the ferry whenever she can.

Mrs. Ebeyer-Verdirame bought a two-family home with her husband, Michael Verdirame, an emergency room physician, for $795,000 in 2013, a block from the Bay Ridge landing. They spent another $200,000 on renovations.

To help pay down the home, they are renting the first floor for $2,050 a month, and the ferry will make it easier to find other tenants, she said. Melissa Leifer, an agent with Keller Williams TriBeCa, said the first floor could rent for $2,300 a month now that the area is luring more renters from downtown Manhattan, a 40-minute ferry away.

It takes Mrs. Ebeyer-Verdirame more than an hour to catch a ferry to Wall Street and then a train to her firm, Ennead Architects, in the West Village, while the express bus takes about 40 minutes. Even so, she braves the cold every morning to wait for the ferry, for one good reason: “We’re the first stop — so you always get a seat.”",How the Ferry Is Changing the Brooklyn-Queens Waterfront,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/realestate/how-the-ferry-is-changing-the-brooklyn-queens-waterfront.html

Two kinds of dancers pack the salsa clubs of Cali, Colombia. There are the purists, who like to keep their footwork on the ground, the way salsa was first danced in the 1970s. Then there are the more daring — typically younger — provocateurs, who incorporate demanding tricks and lifts frowned upon by traditionalists. If you’re keen on finding a partner, you may want to stick to the original formula.

Though it can be found in clubs all over the world now, salsa is still a relatively new dance form. Born in New York City from a mix of music and steps from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Harlem, it came of age in the early 1970s. Alfredo Caicedo Viveros, a salsa historian in Cali, said it wasn’t long before Colombian sailors brought the new trend back with them. “People would say, ‘Do you want to listen to some music from New York?’” he recalled. “It was so rhythmic! It made you move!”

Not long after, dance clubs called salsatecas sprang up in Cali, especially in the working-class neighborhood of the Barrio Obrero. Colombian musicians began forming salsa bands to make their own contributions to the growing scene. Mr. Caicedo cited Grupo Niche, Orquesta Guayacán, Orquesta La Identidad and La Gran Banda Caleña as some of the most popular bands in the early days of Colombian salsa.

Taking its name from the city that developed it, the Cali style developed from a mix of pachanga (a dance best recognized for its shuffled side-to-side steps), charanga (a riff on a traditional Cuban dance) and boogaloo (another form born in New York City, which mixes several styles) dances.

Over time, the Cali style continued to evolve. “We have here a well-known school by Luis Eduardo Hernández (also known as El Mulato), who founded the Swing Latino school,” Mr. Caicedo said. Mr. Eduardo introduced a new element to salsa, Mr. Caicedo said, “which was acrobatics. You know, what they do in the circus — the somersaults.”

The photographer Rose Marie Cromwell came across Cali’s vibrant salsa scene almost by accident. “I heard people tell me that Cali was the capital of the salsa,” she said. It was enough to pique her interest.

“I first went to NellyTeca, brought there by a friend in her late 20s,” Ms. Cromwell said. “Even though the salsa scene mostly consists of older people, she knew about this salsateca so she brought us there. It was packed with people and loud with salsa music. Lots of characters, lots of interesting people.”

That first salsateca also gave Ms. Cromwell some of her favorite memories of the assignment. “NellyTeca was so friendly, so close,” she said. “It kind of got rowdy, and I like that energy. I liked the small ones, that was an experience. It’s where two older ladies were having a beer in the corner, and older couples were dancing together on a small floor. It was bittersweet and romantic. It felt like I traveled back in time.”

Mr. Caicedo’s generation was the first to dance in salsatecas. He met his wife at a dance more than four decades ago. As one of the elder statesmen of the form, Mr. Caicedo still prefers the old-fashioned style, free of showmanship. “We dance on the floor — that’s the Cali style, which is the nice one,” he said. “We show our respect to the ladies. She doesn’t have to be dropped on the floor, and you don’t have to take her by her foot to put her in the air.”

You’ll have an easier time finding the traditional Cali style in a viejoteca, a salsateca that specializes in playing salsa music for a typically older group of dancers. “There’s a loyalty in Cali to the way it was danced, the way people dressed,” Ms. Cromwell said. “Maybe because Colombia was isolated for so long, it stayed the same.”

Once an exercise class for the elderly in the early 1990s, the viejoteca became a refuge for Cali-style purists, according to Mr. Caicedo. Now, viejotecas are weekend parties that start in the afternoon and wind down around 10 p.m. It’s a very different scene from New York, where salsa dancing normally begins in the late evening. Cali’s earlier start time also cuts down the drinking hours. “Not everyone’s drinking. It’s more of a social event, not a drinking event,” Ms. Cromwell said.

There are other differences separating Cali styles and stateside styles. Most of the salsa dancing in the United States requires couples to move back and forth on the dance floor. In Cali, couples move from side to side like a mirror image. Their upper body and arms are supposed to remain still while their feet quickly work through steps that look like a Latin-tinged jive.

Depending on the style you’re dancing in the United States, the motion can vary from big showy gestures and spins to tightly controlled movements confined to the couple’s personal space.

Yet other characteristics remain the same between salseros. The steps are always fast, and the hips are meant to move. The couple should hold onto each other, with the follower reading every change in the leader’s position as a signal for the next move.

“Now, rich people, poor people, everybody dances it. No matter your creed, ideology, gender or partisanship,” Mr. Caicedo said. “You can choose how you want to dress. If you want to dress to honor the old times, you can dress like a dancer. Otherwise, you can enjoy it, but you use your regular clothes.”

Throughout salsatecas large and small, there’s an unmistakable look of focus and energy on the faces of professional and recreational dancers. Some are smiling while holding onto their partners. Others are concentrating on remembering their rehearsed choreography. The dancers on the sidelines watch on or catch their breath. Women wave fans for a cool breeze, and men dry themselves off with handkerchiefs.

Ms. Cromwell said the experience was entertaining to watch and to document. “It was a really fun scene, the dancers were so animated,” she said. “Colombians are an open culture. Everyone wanted to share about Cali, it’s not a touristy scene there.”

No matter the style, that thrill of dancing is always the same. “Salsa evokes human feelings,” Mr. Caicedo said. “It makes me feel ecstatic when I dance. It makes me express that feeling with my limbs, because I feel joy.”

In an open letter published on Friday by Hyperallergic, more than 120 academics and artists have urged Mayor Bill de Blasio to remove five public monuments and markers they say celebrate racism.

The letter singles out the Christopher Columbus monument at Columbus circle, the statue of President Theodore Roosevelt outside of the American Museum of Natural History, the Dr. J. Marion Sims statue in Central Park, and two commemorative markers bearing the names of Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval.

The cost to repair the damage is still being assessed, Mr. Morse said, estimating that it could be a few million dollars.

Cohoes, a city of about 20,000 people about nine miles north of Albany, had attracted commitments to invest in the revitalization of its downtown, Mr. Morse said, adding that the project would continue.

The city, a former mill town, has seen several catastrophic fires. One blaze in 1988, on Remsen Street, the same street as the fire on Thursday, destroyed nine buildings. In 1863, The New York Times reported that several women were killed in the city when a mill they were working in burst into flames.

The fire on Thursday spanned three blocks, making it the largest that Mr. Morse, a former firefighter, could remember.

“We often tell people we don’t allow open burns in the city, and they often say, ‘Well, what’s the worst thing that can happen?’” he said. “Well, this open burn just cost millions of dollars in damage and has destroyed half of our downtown that we’ve worked so hard to rebuild.”","Man Inspired by TV Show ‘Forged in Fire’ Sets Off Huge Blaze, Officials Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/nyregion/fire-upstate-new-york.html

Comey, to drop the bureau’s criminal investigation of Mr. Flynn, and fired Mr. Comey after he failed to comply.
After Mr. Trump named him as his national security adviser in November, Mr. Flynn began briefing him — some say daily — on foreign policy.
In his phone call with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Flynn asked that Russia “not escalate the situation,” according to court documents released on Friday.
A phone call that included Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn, Ms. McFarland, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon was scheduled for 5 p.m., shortly after Ms. McFarland’s email exchange.
Mr. Cobb said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak in the call.","But it is evident from the emails — which were obtained from someone who had access to transition team communications — that after learning that President Barack Obama would expel 35 Russian diplomats, the Trump team quickly strategized about how to reassure Russia. The Trump advisers feared that a cycle of retaliation between the United States and Russia would keep the spotlight on Moscow’s election meddling, tarnishing Mr. Trump’s victory and potentially hobbling his presidency from the start.

As part of the outreach, Ms. McFarland wrote, Mr. Flynn would be speaking with the Russian ambassador, Mr. Kislyak, hours after Mr. Obama’s sanctions were announced.

“Key will be Russia’s response over the next few days,” Ms. McFarland wrote in an email to another transition official, Thomas P. Bossert, now the president’s homeland security adviser.

In an interview, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the Russia inquiry, said there was nothing illegal or unethical about the transition team’s actions. “It would have been political malpractice not to discuss sanctions,” he said, adding that “the presidential transition guide specifically encourages contact with and outreach to foreign dignitaries.”

The only problem, Mr. Cobb said, was that Mr. Flynn had lied to White House officials and to F.B.I. agents about what he had told the Russian ambassador. Mr. Flynn’s misstatements led to his firing in February and his guilty plea on Friday to charges of lying to federal agents.

With Mr. Flynn’s plea and agreement to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Russian election interference, the inquiry edges closer to Mr. Trump. The president tried to persuade the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to drop the bureau’s criminal investigation of Mr. Flynn, and fired Mr. Comey after he failed to comply.

Mr. Trump and his aides have suggested that his concern about Mr. Flynn’s potential legal jeopardy was motivated mainly by the president’s admiration for his former national security adviser’s military service and character.

But the new details about Mr. Flynn’s Russia contacts underscore the possibility that the president may have been worried not just about Mr. Flynn but also about whether any investigation might reach into the White House and perhaps to the Oval Office. That question will be at the center of any consideration by Mr. Mueller of whether Mr. Trump’s actions constituted obstruction of justice.

The Trump transition team ignored a pointed request from the Obama administration to avoid sending conflicting signals to foreign officials before the inauguration and to include State Department personnel when contacting them. Besides the Russian ambassador, Mr. Flynn, at the request of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, contacted several other foreign officials to urge them to delay or block a United Nations resolution condemning Israel over its building of settlements.

Mr. Cobb said the Trump team had never agreed to avoid such interactions. But one former White House official has disputed that, telling Mr. Mueller’s investigators that Trump transition officials had agreed to honor the Obama administration’s request.

Mr. Bossert forwarded Ms. McFarland’s Dec. 29 email exchange about the sanctions to six other Trump advisers, including Mr. Flynn; Reince Priebus, who had been named as chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the senior strategist; and Sean Spicer, who would become the press secretary.

Mr. Obama, she wrote, was trying to “box Trump in diplomatically with Russia,” which could limit his options with other countries, including Iran and Syria. “Russia is key that unlocks door,” she wrote.

She also wrote that the sanctions over Russian election meddling were intended to “lure Trump in trap of saying something” in defense of Russia, and were aimed at “discrediting Trump’s victory by saying it was due to Russian interference.”

“If there is a tit-for-tat escalation Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia, which has just thrown U.S.A. election to him,” she wrote.

Mr. Bossert replied by urging all the top advisers to “defend election legitimacy now.”

Mr. Flynn, who had been fired by Mr. Obama as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was the point person for the transition team on policy toward Russia and other countries. After Mr. Trump named him as his national security adviser in November, Mr. Flynn began briefing him — some say daily — on foreign policy.

Ms. McFarland, who served until May as deputy national security adviser and is awaiting confirmation as ambassador to Singapore, was sometimes referred to by other transition officials as “Flynn’s brain.” She could not be reached for comment.

Mr. Flynn’s Dec. 29 call with Mr. Kislyak was one of the first formal interactions between the incoming administration and a foreign government. On that winter day, Mr. Trump’s closest associates were scattered around several warm-weather locations.

Mr. Flynn was in the Dominican Republic. Other senior members of Mr. Trump’s transition team, including Ms. McFarland, were at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Kushner was vacationing in Hawaii with his family.

Obama administration officials were expecting a “bellicose” response to the expulsions and sanctions, according to the email exchange between Ms. McFarland and Mr. Bossert. Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser, had told Mr. Bossert that “the Russians have already responded with strong threats, promising to retaliate,” according to the emails.

In his phone call with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Flynn asked that Russia “not escalate the situation,” according to court documents released on Friday. He later related the substance of the call — including the discussion of sanctions — to a senior transition official, believed to be Ms. McFarland. A few days later, he briefed others on the transition team.

Mr. Flynn’s intervention appeared to have a dramatic effect. To the surprise of foreign policy experts, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not immediately respond with retaliatory expulsions of Americans from Moscow.

Mr. Trump praised that decision in a tweet, writing: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart.”

It is uncertain how involved Mr. Trump was in the discussions among his staff members of Mr. Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador. Mr. Spicer told reporters on the morning of Dec. 29 that the president-elect would be meeting with his national security team, including Ms. McFarland, that day. A phone call that included Mr. Trump, Mr. Flynn, Ms. McFarland, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon was scheduled for 5 p.m., shortly after Ms. McFarland’s email exchange. It is unclear whether the call took place.

Mr. Cobb said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak in the call. After the inauguration, “Flynn specifically denied it to him, in the presence of witnesses,” he said.

Some legal experts have speculated that the contacts during the transition between Trump aides and foreign officials might violate the Logan Act, a law that prohibits private American citizens from working with a foreign government against the United States. But the act has not been used to prosecute anyone since the 19th century. Mr. Cobb said the law “certainly does not apply” to a presidential transition team.

The day after the president fired Mr. Flynn, he talked about the F.B.I. inquiry with Mr. Comey, the agency’s director. Mr. Comey has said the president urged him to drop the inquiry. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump said, according to a memo that Mr. Comey wrote immediately afterward. The White House has denied that account. The president fired Mr. Comey in May.

Testifying before Congress in June, Mr. Comey declined to say whether the president had fired him to impede the investigation. “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct,” he said. “I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that’s an offense.”",Emails Dispute White House Claims That Flynn Acted Independently on Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/russia-mcfarland-flynn-trump-emails.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

And while the Detroit area is studded with empty lots that once had factories, the Mahindra plant is a promising sign of blue-collar jobs on the horizon.","“How many people told Elon Musk, ‘You don’t have any hope of getting into the car business’?” he said.

Mahindra is a major producer of cars and trucks in India and South Korea, but until now it was mainly known in the United States as the world’s leading maker of tractors. Mr. Mahindra said Detroit was a focal point for growth for the company’s American businesses, which also include manufacturing electric bikes and scooters.

“We have a responsibility to contribute to the resurgence of Detroit,” Mr. Mahindra said at the plant’s opening ceremony. “That means jobs, and that means investment.”

While the planned production volume pales in comparison with the output of large, mainstream auto plants, the factory underscores that the Detroit area is again attracting automotive investment.

The region is still a prime source of engineering talent and manufacturing know-how, as well as a technology incubator for electric cars and self-driving systems. Mahindra already has a design and engineering center in Troy, half an hour north of Detroit, that turns out prototypes of future vehicles.

Other foreign companies have also made big investments in the Detroit area and throughout the upper Midwest. Chinese firms have bought a former General Motors steering-gear division in Saginaw, Mich., and an automotive glass plant in Moraine, Ohio. One of the largest auto suppliers in Detroit is the Indian firm Sakthi Automotive, which is expanding its operations into a long-shuttered high school on the city’s hardscrabble southwest side.

Detroit’s mayor, Mike Duggan, has made rebuilding the city’s depressed industrial base a priority, and last year lured the auto-parts supplier Flex-N-Gate — owned by a Pakistani native, Shahid Khan — to construct a $95 million factory near downtown.

“It’s the kind of development that Detroit has not been able to compete for in recent years,” Mr. Duggan said at the plant’s groundbreaking last year. “But we are starting to compete now.”

Mahindra’s footprint in the Detroit area is small so far, with $230 million invested in the plant, the technical center and two related operations that employ about 270 people combined. The Auburn Hills site where the company is building its factory, in Detroit’s northern suburbs, had been empty for years after housing an engineering firm.

The company expects to build about 5,000 off-road vehicles in the plant’s first year, then add capacity to more than double the volume.

By comparison, the last full-scale plant constructed in Detroit — a Fiat Chrysler factory that opened in 1992 — makes more than 300,000 Jeeps annually.

Mahindra also assembles tractors at several American plants and employs about 3,000 workers over all across the United States, part of a worldwide work force of more than 200,000.

If Mahindra aims to make the leap in the American market from tractors and off-road models to cars or sport-utility vehicles, it has several options.

Mahindra builds and sells its own branded S.U.V.s and pickups in its home market and elsewhere in Asia, and could import variations of those vehicles into the United States. It also owns the South Korean carmaker Ssangyong Motor and the Italian design and engineering firm Pininfarina, both of which could participate in producing models for the American market.

Still, analysts foresee a tough challenge for any new entries into the hypercompetitive American auto market. After two consecutive years of record sales, demand has slipped in 2017. Moreover, automakers like General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota are broadening their product lineups with both conventional gasoline-powered models and new electrified vehicles.

“It will be an uphill battle for Mahindra,” said Michelle Krebs, a longtime analyst with the firm Autotrader. “Tesla has done a brilliant job building a new brand, but it’s very expensive to do that.”

Yet it is hardly surprising that Mahindra has chosen to put down roots in Detroit to help it achieve its ambitions of becoming a player in the American market.

“This is where the expertise is for building vehicles,” Ms. Krebs said. “You’ve got the talent here and the suppliers, and it is the center of excellence for so much of the industry’s research and development activities.”

Manufacturing employment in the Detroit area declined substantially during the recession, which crippled auto sales and forced G.M. and the former Chrysler to seek government bailouts and bankruptcy protection to survive. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing jobs declined nearly 40 percent in the metropolitan area from 2005 to 2009, and have yet to bounce back completely.

But the revival of the overall market for new vehicles, as well as the return of the Detroit car companies to financial health, has spurred a steady comeback for auto jobs — particularly in the high-tech sector supporting advances in autonomous driving and electric vehicles.

And while the Detroit area is studded with empty lots that once had factories, the Mahindra plant is a promising sign of blue-collar jobs on the horizon. The company expects to add another 400 jobs in the area by 2020, investing an additional $600 million — and to continue to be a factor in the auto capital’s resurgence.

“It is great to be part of this comeback story,” said Rajan Wadhera, president of Mahindra’s global automotive business. “We have a long and profitable and mutually beneficial relationship ahead of us.”",Indian Automaker’s Plant Is Latest Sign of Detroit Comeback,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/business/detroit-indian-automaker.html

“I’m flabbergasted that they wouldn’t let her make the decision,” Mr. Laniewicz told me. “They’re doctors — they’re paid to perform surgeries for this kind of thing. I can’t believe that they are allowed to say, ‘No, we won’t do this.’ ”

Ms. Laniewicz added: “It’s not like I didn’t think it through; it’s not like I’m not an adult.” But her doctors wouldn’t treat her like one.

There’s no definitive research on how many women seek sterilization only to be turned away, but I’ve spoken to and learned about many people who have experiences similar to mine. Catherine Pearson at HuffPost interviewed a woman who had to wait about five years between her first sterilization request at age 24 and the time she found a doctor willing to do it. The difficulties and stigma surrounding sterilization have even led to the creation of a Reddit forum of “childfree-friendly” providers who may be more open to performing the procedure.

Some of the barriers to elective sterilization — like the 30-day waiting period and minimum age of 21 required of Medicaid patients seeking the procedure — are well intentioned, meant to prevent the abuses and coercion that vulnerable populations have experienced throughout American history. As recently as 2010, California prisons were found to be sterilizing female inmates against their will.

But when it comes to women who make an informed decision to ask for sterilization, everything from age, marital status and previous number of pregnancies to a hospital’s religious affiliation or a doctor’s personal beliefs can be used as a reason to deny care. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists makes these biases explicit in 2007: The procedure “may have important effects on individuals other than the patient,” such as the patient’s husband or partner (whose approval some doctors require). The unusual requirements some doctors impose — waiting periods, age restrictions and psychological evaluations — are similar to those that legislators opposed to abortion have enacted for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies.

Dr. Julie Chor, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Chicago, has written about structural and institutional barriers to sterilization. She told me that physicians may have “their own personal set of rules as to who it is or is not appropriate to perform a sterilization on.” She also noted that the possibility of regret, in addition to whether or not a patient is a good candidate for surgery and is well informed about nonpermanent long-term contraceptive options, is also a large part of a doctor’s decision whether or not to sterilize a woman.

As a result, the percentage of women of childbearing age who have been sterilized hovers around 18 percent, and this figure has declined since the early 2000s. Sterilization is most common among women who are married, 35 or older and have two or more children, but even these women can find it hard to obtain the procedure — in one study, less than half of pregnant women who requested sterilization hours or days after giving birth got it. And this is for a procedure covered by insurance; the Affordable Care Act requires all plans to cover it, except for the small number provided by employers with a religious exception.

Doctors ought to put aside their biases and learn to trust their patients. They should not fear malpractice lawsuits brought by patients who change their minds, as long as the requirements for informed consent were met. Such reversals on the part of patients aren’t even likely; some 80 percent of women under 30 who undergo elective sterilization do not regret the procedure.

At age 29, with the fifth doctor she consulted, Ms. Laniewicz was finally able to get an endometrial ablation, a treatment for her endometriosis , but only after three “strong talks” from her medical providers.

I was sitting at a bar near the far-flung N Gates at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, awaiting a flight to Nevada nearly six weeks after a high-stakes video poker player named Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more before taking his own life in Las Vegas. Heavily armed, Mr. Paddock fired on a crowd of 22,000 country music fans at an outdoor festival across the street from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the far south end of the Las Vegas Strip, marking one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

This tragedy did not appear to be on the minds of the quartet of women seated next to me, who were headed to Sin City to celebrate a 50th birthday. They ordered a round of tequila shots and chased them down with beer, a routine one imagined out loud would be repeated more than once during their excursion. Their unburdening of starch-collared decorum had commenced before they had even boarded the plane, suggesting that Vegas is a state of mind as much as it is a physical destination.

As for me, I was venturing to Las Vegas to assess the mood of a town that stands as America’s undisputed champion of fun and risk. It would go against Vegas’ s very essence to curl up and hide; how does a place this uniquely outgoing steel itself in the wake of such a tragedy?

Touching down at McCarran International Airport, Mandalay Bay was the first thing I saw out my window. But the way I knew I was in Las Vegas was by its scent, a singularly pungent bouquet of cologne, cigarette smoke, steak and sewage. It’s not especially pleasant, but it awakens you — and nobody comes to Vegas to sleep.

Nobody, that is, except for those who live and work here. Jordan Peck, a twentysomething bartender at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, is one such person. Born in Utah, he moved to Las Vegas when he was 2 years old and has been here ever since. Asked what someone who works on or near the Strip does for fun, he half-jokingly replied, “Go home.”

Since the shooting, Mr. Peck’s out-of-town customers haven’t blinked. “Everybody here seems exactly the same,” he said of the tourists.

But among locals or those who witnessed the horror at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, the story is quite different.

I sat down at Mr. Peck’s bar and ordered a Manhattan, which he gracefully placed atop a digital gambling console. This being the Hard Rock, Tom Petty’s “Learning to Fly” filled the air.

Mr. Paddock committed his atrocities on Oct. 1; Mr. Petty passed away on Oct. 2. On Oct. 7, Jason Aldean, the artist who was onstage when Mr. Paddock opened fire, made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” where he opened the show with a cover of Mr. Petty’s hit song “I Won’t Back Down.” It was a crippling confluence, and plenty profound.

Business was slow for Mr. Peck on this Thursday night, which gave him ample time to chat with his friend Renee McKinley, a Las Vegas native who works in a dental office. Today marked her first trip to the Strip (although the Hard Rock sits a few blocks off it) since the tragedy. When she drove past the “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign, which became a public shrine after Oct. 1, she started crying.

Growing up in Las Vegas, Ms. McKinley said, she viewed her hometown as a soulless entity. But the local response to Mr. Paddock’s crime has called this belief into doubt.

“The way our community stepped up, it proved me wrong,” she said.

To this end, Mr. Peck pointed to how so many people rushed to give blood in the wake of the shooting that a waiting list had to be established, and how volunteers flooded hospitals — not to get treatment, but to help clean up.

This sort of embrace could be felt through fiber optics, too. Shortly after the shooting, Ms. McKinley had to place an out-of-state call to verify a patient’s insurance coverage. As she said the words “Las Vegas,” her voice quivered. On the other end of the line, the woman felt her anguish and, said Ms. McKinley, “was hugging me through the phone.”

It was the weekend of Las Vegas’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon, which, with 25,000 participants, was to be the largest public event on the Strip since the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Sauntering through a sleepy Mandalay Bay casino on Friday morning were a pair of guests from Florida, Terri Monken and Jenny Glew, who were in town to run the half-marathon.

They had booked their rooms in March and gave no thought to canceling after the massacre. “We’ve got to keep it going,” explained Ms. Monken, praising her accommodations and the employees she had encountered as “beautiful.”

Ms. Glew then offered an assessment that I’d hear more than once over the course of my four-night stay, theorizing that Mandalay Bay “has got to be one of the safest places” in town in the wake of the tragedy. This was true in a visible sense, as the facility has beefed up security in order to reassure guests.

Up an escalator from the casino floor is a mini-mall called The Shoppes at Mandalay Place. At 10 a.m., Leanne Nevico opened The Guinness Store. Featuring beer gear galore, hers is the only outlet of its kind outside of Ireland.

A Connecticut native, Ms. Nevico moved to Las Vegas nearly a decade ago “for a man,” she said. She’s now been married to that man for five years; the pair met playing the interactive video game “Final Fantasy II,” and she described their home south of the Strip as “a gamer’s paradise.”

Like Ms. McKinley, Ms. Nevico said it’s been “really rough” driving by the Welcome to Las Vegas sign on her way to work each day, and she has been similarly moved by the way the community has rallied, recalling scenes of Uber drivers showing up to shuttle shooting victims to the hospital for free. Ms. Nevico wasn’t working when Mr. Paddock opened fire, but her employees had to shelter in place overnight. They were fortunate to have access to an adjacent pub that Guinness’ owners also operate, whereas a friend of hers who works at a sandal store had it a whole lot rougher absent food and a proper restroom.

The day after the shooting, Ms. Nevico said, “The casino was a ghost town.” But she opened her store — which features a bar from which she pours Guinness products — at 1 p.m. “for people who were stuck.”

“A lot of people just came in to drink and to share their stories,” she said.

Ms. Nevico said she has noticed a significant increase in the amount of police and private security patrolling the Mandalay Bay grounds, and noted that the resort has been stricken with an unusually high vacancy rate in the wake of the shooting. (A spokeswoman for MGM, which owns the Mandalay Bay, confirmed as much, adding that business is slowly returning to normal.) Mandalay Bay was recently named as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by 450 shooting victims, whose lawyers claim the resort and concert organizers didn’t do enough to prevent the tragedy.

“People are more vigilant,” said Ms. Nevico, who has noticed several “rubberneckers” angling for a look at the crime scene. “I don’t know what it is we’re looking for, but we’re more vigilant.”

A few miles north on Las Vegas Boulevard at Graceland Wedding Chapel, officiant Cecelia Cajueiro was preparing to renew the vows of a Brazilian couple, Fabio and Tatiana Costa, when Elvis Presley entered the building, wielding a guitar.

Portrayed by the chapel’s towering, hyperactive, pompadoured owner, Brendan Paul, the King incongruously plucked out melodies by AC/DC, Kiss and Metallica as the encore bride danced alongside him. Escorted by Elvis, Ms. Costa walked toward the altar to “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” ultimately cinching the Portuguese service with “Viva Las Vegas,” which Mr. Paul belted out on a microphone over a canned backing track.

Mr. Paul, clad in a black suit with red sapphires and no undershirt, has owned the chapel since 2003. Having cut his teeth playing in Los Angeles punk bands, he’s an unlikely proprietor and impersonator, and unflinchingly liberal.

“Every other Elvis I know is for Trump,” Mr. Paul said.

In part because Mr. Paul’s core clientele is international, the shooting down the street hasn’t affected his bottom line, he said. But it’s definitely been on his mind.

“People are just angry,” he surmised. “I think it’s because of Trump. It’s exhausting.”

West of the chapel, in an otherwise desolate neighborhood where tumbleweeds would find ample room to roll down roads, sits a funky drinking establishment called ReBar. Everything inside the bar — including the stools — is for sale, having been sourced or scavenged by the owner, Derek Stonebarger, a hip, energetic cancer survivor who heads up the Las Vegas Arts District Neighborhood Association.

A handful of Main Street businesses — a vintage clothing store here, a craft cocktail lounge there — anchor this fledgling, resident-focused scene in an area that “was always sort of a dumpy part of town,” said Jack Doré, a ReBar bartender.

“You used to come down here to buy drugs or get stabbed, or maybe both,” explained Mr. Doré, who rented a cheap studio apartment in the Arts District upon relocating from his native southeast Louisiana in 2014.

Late Sunday morning, he had ReBar’s television sets tuned to N.F.L. football and was doling out $1 Avery Real Peel I.P.A.s and locally butchered hot links to a smattering of customers.

Of the shooting, Mr. Doré said, “No one really talks about it. The first couple of weeks were pretty slow, but it’s back to normal. I don’t know if there will be a normal, though. People are wary of going out in groups. But, most of all, people are just brushing it off.”

Having hosted numerous country music awards shows, not to mention the Route 91 Harvest Festival, Las Vegas has become a sort of Nashville West in recent years. At the center of its local country community is Stoney’s Rockin’ Country, a spacious nightclub in a shopping mall south of Mandalay Bay that offers all-you-can-drink Pabst for $25 and line-dancing lessons before live shows.

As I entered Stoney’s to take in a performance by the insurgent band A Thousand Horses, I was asked to raise my hands as though I were passing through security at an airport. This is a milder approach than the metal-detecting wands the establishment’s bouncers wielded in the weeks immediately following the massacre, said Stoney’s spokesman Toad Higginbotham, who was backstage with his girlfriend at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when shots rang out.

“We just ran,” he said of his reaction to the gunfire.

Stoney’s patrons Kristi Klein and Julie Cavender of Orange County, Calif., were at the festival as well. They were also staying at Mandalay Bay in a room overlooking Mr. Paddock’s. The two friends couldn’t bring themselves to book a room there for this return trip, instead opting for The Wynn.

“The reality is we all have PTSD,” Ms. Cavender said.

Added Ms. Klein, “That’s why we’re here.”

Ambition is the name of the game on this week’s list of recommended books. “Ramp Hollow” tells the centuries-long story of Appalachia. A biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, the author of “Little House on the Prairie,” doubles as a sweeping work of Western American history. John Banville attempts no less than channeling Henry James, in a sequel to “The Portrait of a Lady.” With a month left to go before New Year’s resolutions, the lesson to take from these authors might be: Aim high.

RAMP HOLLOW: The Ordeal of Appalachia, by Steven Stoll. (Hill and Wang, $30.) Stoll’s book is a powerful and outrage-making analysis of the forces, over centuries, that have shaped Appalachia. “ ‘Ramp Hollow’ is not ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ redux,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. Stoll “does not relate his own story, and his book is not especially warm to the touch. But as economic history it is gravid and well made.”

THE WATER WILL COME: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World, by Jeff Goodell. (Little, Brown, $28.) In “The Water Will Come,” Goodell, whose previous books include “Big Coal” and “How to Cool the Planet,” visits cities around the globe in peril because of climate change. “After this year’s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, ‘The Water Will Come’ is depressingly well-timed,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes, “though I’m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on.”

THE LOVER, WARTIME NOTEBOOKS and PRACTICALITIES, by Marguerite Duras. (Everyman’s Library, $30.) In this collection of three books, our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “We get as complete a portrait as we can hope for: the writer the world knows (‘The Lover’ was a global best seller); the one performing her public role (she’s very much the literary grande dame in the chatty essays in ‘Practicalities’); and the one at work, spurring herself on in notebooks that an editor called Duras’s ‘workshop, gymnasium, kitchen, treasure chest.’ ”

After all, in the early 1980s, the political upheaval and violence in nearby El Salvador — where I was based — dominated the headlines. We should have kept covering the civil war there, the spokesman said, since there really wasn’t anything worth covering in Guatemala.

But that only hardened our resolve to take a closer look. We redoubled our efforts to report on the military and opposition groups ensnared in what would ultimately be a 36-year conflict that claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people, mostly indigenous Maya, between 1960 and 1996. Some 45,000 victims disappeared, while more than one million people were displaced. Yet this conflict raged on in relative obscurity and mystery, even as the 1980s ushered in an era of horrific violence.

Traveling by bus from Guatemala City and into the Quiché highlands to the northwest, the urban bustle gave way to a dramatic landscape of rolling, verdant hills, though the awe inspired by that vista was soon displaced by a sense of menace. Army checkpoints appeared 30 minutes outside of Chichicastenango, where bus and car passengers lined up to show identity papers. Foreign tourists were generally exempt from the low-level suspicion and harassment shown to the Maya.

I was familiar with Guatemala’s turbulent political history and the C.I.A.’s support of its 1954 coup. But I was relatively new to the daily terror tactics of Central America where U.S.-backed troops used fear and violence to contain a growing left-wing insurgency. But unlike in El Salvador, where the United States openly provided military advisers and equipment, American support for Guatemala’s military government was purposefully hidden and downplayed.

The military’s campaign of violence and terror was carried out with rigor and exactitude. The way to multiply a political murder’s horror was to leave corpses in full public view, like on the side of the road with a slit throat and torn-off clothing. “This could happen to you,” was the clear message sent to potential victims, warning them of the fate that awaited those suspected of supporting the rebels.

These weren’t peripheral incidents with marginal players but a closely-managed pacification campaign whose violent counterinsurgency tactics were supported by other right-wing anti-Communist countries and their military attachés and trainers in Guatemala. Taiwan provided anti-Communist psy-ops training; Argentina contributed counterintelligence and interrogation techniques from its own Dirty War; South Africa supplied communications equipment and training; while Israel provided weapons for the soldiers and infantry. A small number of Spanish-speaking U.S. Special Forces troops worked in the field and at military training camps.

In January 1982, I traveled with Christopher Dickey, The Washington Post’s correspondent, to the military headquarters in Santa Cruz del Quiché to speak with the Guatemalan Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Benedicto Lucas García. The French-trained general implemented a scorched-earth policy aimed at eliminating a growing insurgency in the indigenous areas of the western highlands. The rebellion was at its peak, and the Guatemalan guerrillas considered themselves allies of Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the leftist F.M.L.N in El Salvador.

The general invited Chris and me on a helicopter flight over the mountainous farming area of the Quiché, where they targeted the enemy with simple, deadly logic: Anyone running from our white Bell helicopter was either a guerrilla or a sympathizer.

Accompanied by two door-gunners and an intelligence officer, Gen. Lucas García sat in the co-pilot’s seat and directed the flight around the rural areas. We were 15 minutes from the provincial capital, flying about 1,500 feet, when he spotted a group of women running away from the approaching helicopter. He ordered the pilot to circle the farm below and bank the helicopter hard so the door gunners could have a better view.

Then he yelled out the command to open fire, “Dale! Dale!” — “Give it to them! Give it to them!”

The gunners blasted away in a hail of smoke and spent cartridges, the pilot turned and banked again, noisily circling above as civilians were cut down with the American-supplied M60 machine guns. Gen. Lucas García explained to us that since the campesinos (peasant farmers) had run away from the helicopter, they had to have been guilty. When The Washington Post published Chris’s story, Gen. Lucas García denied he ever ordered his men to fire, even though a photograph of the door-gunner in action (Slide 3) accompanied the story.

On various occasions in the early 1980s, I left El Salvador to work in Guatemala, photographing in the Ixil triangle and western highlands. I used a Rollei 2¼ camera, a tripod and black-and-white film. The film, from Todos Santos and Nebaj, had been in storage and mostly unseen since 1985.

At the time, the violence in the highlands was fearful, mysterious and intimidating. Asking villagers in Todos Santos and Nebaj to sit for a portrait, I felt the best I could hope for was a glimpse of their dignity and independence and what they were desperately trying to hold onto in the midst of the cruel, scorched-earth injustices and devastating military sweeps: Exactly what the blasé embassy spokesman had dismissively wanted us to overlook.

“You see why having an all-gay City Council is no big deal?” he told me. “Nobody cares anymore.”

Palm Springs so thoroughly embraces L.G.B.T. people that Holstege, who is married to a man, faced questions about whether she was inventing her bisexuality for political gain.

“Social media started to trash her,” said Roberts, 57, who supported her candidacy. “They were saying she’s not really bi, maybe she had an experience in college, and now she wants to sweep up gay dollars and gay votes. So I called her up one day and said: ‘Christy, I’m making the weirdest call I’ve ever made in my entire life. You’re being accused of being fake gay, fake bi. This is a whole new world for me. This is a parallel universe.’ ”

He was backing her, he said, because of her erudition — she has a law degree from Stanford — and her expertise regarding homelessness and affordable housing. But he did care about her truthfulness and wanted her assurance that her critics were off base. She gave that to him.

She gave it to me, too, and said that during her campaign, she in fact shied away from talk about sexual orientation. When I asked her what the new Council’s first order of business should be, she mentioned making it easier for people at the airport to summon Uber or Lyft.

In general the City Council race included little talk about identity politics. Middleton told me that she was seldom asked about being a transgender woman but routinely fielded questions about downtown development and the city’s budget, subjects she knew well because of her extensive involvement in civic organizations. High on her wish list for the city is six more police officers and four more firefighters. That was among her campaign promises.

I asked the police chief, Bryan Reyes, about her victory. He was jubilant. “I just believe — I really believe — in her,” he said. “I’m a straight male. I have no problem doing photo ops, giving her hugs, because of the person she is, what she represents, her work ethic, her character.”

When she and I had lunch, servers and others rushed over to congratulate her. “Do we refer to you as ‘City Councilwoman’ or just plain Lisa?” asked one of the restaurant’s owners, John Paschal.

“Her Exalted,” Middleton suggested, and they both laughed. Then she went back to bending my ear about spurring entrepreneurship in Palm Springs.

She sees the city, which has a population of just under 50,000 people, as a beacon of inclusion. But she also sees it as an example of how Americans “have been sorting ourselves,” with liberals and conservatives in separate enclaves. (The new Council is entirely Democratic.) And she has mixed feelings about that. “We get our information from different newspapers,” she said. “We live in different communities. We’re becoming not just polarized but isolated.”

Roberts echoed that over dinner at that tropical-themed restaurant with his fellow councilman Kors, 56, a lawyer and longtime gay rights advocate. “Isn’t our goal not to be separated out?” he said.

Of course there is a connection between power and sex, but it is a connection mediated by the ego.

If the sexual behavior that is being criticized in the press were truly driven by the instincts of the body, as Mr. Marche asserts, the accused men would have been exposing themselves to women up and down their hierarchical social chains. But that is not what’s happened. Instead, immature and damaged people have allowed themselves to harass and/or assault targets they deem easy to conquer. In doing so they catered to their ego needs, not their bodily needs.

It is reasonable to expect that by the time one reaches adulthood one can distinguish between needs driven by the body and those driven by the ego, and between a willing partner and a target. If a man — or a woman — can’t figure that out, control himself or herself, and act accordingly, he or she shouldn’t be left unchallenged in a position of power and influence.

To the Editor:

Oh, boy, here we go again: A generalized attack on the male gender. The author’s resort to Sigmund Freud and Andrea Dworkin was the deflating end of reason. Growing up in a working-class home, I learned from my father how to behave around women. I don’t find it necessary to grope women. I believe we are talking about a small subsection of the male gender — alpha males, sex addicts and drunken adolescents. Please spare us the unsubstantiated opinion of one guy proposing to speak for the duties and obligations of all men.

To the Editor:

As an older male I have to thank Stephen Marche for educating me as to the source of all my mistakes in life — my “brutal” male libido. Thank goodness this good Catholic boy has a great excuse for my transgressions for St. Peter at the Pearly Gates.

Though one might question Mr. Marche’s fundamentally Hobbesian worldview that people are inherently evil, particularly the men: “How are we supposed to create an equal world when male mechanisms of desire are inherently brutal?”

These harassment incidents were not episodes of libido but power, pure and simple, and to universally condemn the nature of “males” is arrant nonsense emanating from a serious ideological fallacy that guys are just at the mercy of their “male mechanisms.”

STEPHEN F. DESMOND

PROVIDENCE, R.I.

To the Editor:

Stephen Marche asks the fundamental question behind the recent avalanche of sexual allegations: What can society do about the male libido, which leads to so much female suffering?

Perhaps a simple progressive policy change could help: legalize prostitution. It won’t be for everyone, nor will it cure all powerful men (and women), but just think about how many problems it would solve while we try to help humans conquer this “brutal” God-given affliction.

DANIEL KUNCIO, NEW YORK

To the Editor:

O.K., there are pigs, but what we seem to have here is an author who finds men to be fundamentally vile. Enough is enough. There is nothing inherently “toxic” about masculinity — in fact, as a woman, I can say it’s rather wonderful. Nor, for the great majority of men, is their sex drive “brutal.” And, without getting unnecessarily graphic, for a woman, really marvelous — even transcendental — sex is derived from the driving power of her partner’s desire. A sweet surrender that merges flesh and soul.

While Andrea Dworkin is welcome to her belief that, as Stephen Marche describes it, “the only sex between a man and a woman that could be undertaken without violence was sex with a flaccid penis,” neither mankind or womankind would be happier for that, not to mention the countless unborn generations.

LINDA STEWART, NEW YORK

To the Editor:

After a close reading, I’m unable to discern where Stephen Marche stands on the nurture versus masculinity-is-destiny continuum, nor do I know exactly what men and women are supposed to do next. Muddle through, I suppose.

But this I do know: Before men are men, they are boys. Until we commit to intentionally raising both boys and girls with high expectations and a single standard of values based on empathy and fairness — with sex and gender being no exception — we won’t do much better than that.

I recently overheard two 6-year-old boys laughing and chanting, “Boys go to college to get knowledge, girls go to Jupiter to get stupider.” And so it goes.

Traditional gender roles, opposite and unequal by design in terms of power, privilege and status, are tools of oppression used deliberately for centuries to enable a small minority of men to oppress not only women but also the vast majority of other men in the world. Let’s examine and work on that kind of male brutality, and see what happens.

The writer has taught human sexuality education and is the author of “Talk to Me First: Everything You Need to Know to Become Your Kids’ ‘Go-To’ Person About Sex.”

To the Editor:

Stephen Marche writes that we should “start with a basic understanding that masculinity is a subject worth thinking about.” Enough of that. Let’s start with a basic understanding that femininity is a subject worth thinking about — finally. The first Western story in literature is about Adam and Eve. That story has been interpreted as one of disobedience, and Eve was punished for her chutzpah. Could that apple be a metaphor for her sexual libido? We need Camille Paglia to step in here and defend the power of the feminine so women can see that they need not be victims. We are entering a celebrity cultural space where I fear that the victimhood card has greater appeal than standing on your own powerful apples.

WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out at the F.B.I. on Sunday, defending himself after the guilty plea by his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, by charging that the bureau’s reputation was “in tatters — worst in history” and denying that he had told his first F.B.I. director to end the Flynn investigation.

By 9, as a wispy 88-pounder competing in the 97-pound weight class, she squatted 215 pounds to break a world record held by a 44-year-old German woman.

Naomi is now 16, but her slim build makes her heavy lifts look even more incredible, and early on she gained the Supergirl nickname as a sweet description for a diminutive athlete. But the name has expanded into an intensely competitive alter ego for an otherwise shy and unassuming teenager.

“In school plays, I get stage fright, but I don’t have stage fright in powerlifting, even if I’m in front of hundreds of people,” said Naomi, whose modern Orthodox Jewish family follows strict religious rules.

While she must wear modest attire at her all-girls Yeshiva in Teaneck, her powerlifting outfit includes a singlet and T-shirt, as well as colorfully striped knee socks, always mismatched, and bright red high-tops.

To work herself into an adrenaline-fueled zone of concentration at the recent Sunday competition, she paced behind the lifting area, with heavy metal blasting on her headphones.

“I hate it — I only listen to it before I lift,” said Naomi, who approaches the bar with yells, growls, staccato breathing and pumping arms. It is an unexpected preparatory ritual from a teenage girl who spends her weekdays studying the Talmud.

Naomi often competes alongside her 14-year-old brother, Ari, and their father, Ed Kutin, both of whom are also accomplished lifters. Her mother, Neshama, assumes the role of manager. During the recent competition, Ms. Kutin cheered on her family and joked about her superstrong children shirking chores.

In truth, she said, they are helpful. Years ago, Naomi helped with the groceries by carrying a 60-pound bag of dog food out of the supermarket. A bystander called it too heavy a load for a child.

As a child, Naomi was a standout in karate and could beat the local boys at push-ups and other strength exercises. Her father, a longtime powerlifter, asked her to join his lifting workouts.

“She said, ‘I thought you’d never ask me,’” Ms. Kutin recalled.

The family ran it by their rabbi, since it is an unconventional activity for Orthodox girls. And then Naomi was off and lifting.

Too young for a gym membership, Naomi worked out with Mr. Kutin’s weights in the basement next to the washer and dryer.

Mr. Kutin taught Naomi basic techniques and grounded her in the rudiments of athletic motivation: the first three “Rocky” movies.

“We thought when she first started that it’d be a kid fad, that she’d quit within three months,” Ms. Kutin said recently as the family trained in their cramped basement.

On the wall was her hand-scrawled sign — “No Fear” — next to a Jewish calendar.

Naomi cranked up the heavy metal music and loaded heavy plates on the bar for sets of squats, lowering into a crouch with the weight bar on her shoulders. Then came dead lifts, short hoists from the ground while standing.

Naomi is the subject of a documentary “Supergirl,” to be broadcast Dec. 18 as part of the Independent Lens series on PBS.

The Kutins are often the only observant Jewish family at lifting meets, and they bring a large box of kosher food and drinks. Fans and fellow competitors often give Naomi Supergirl memorabilia.

Because of Sabbath rules, they do not compete on Saturdays, when many of the female trials are held. Many tournament officials allow Naomi to lift on Sunday with men competing in the heavyweight category.

It is quite a sight: a wispy teenage girl lifting alongside musclebound and heavily tattooed men.

“Most women and kids don’t do that,” she said. “But men get more physically psyched, so I actually prefer lifting with the men.”","Meet ‘Supergirl,’ the World’s Strongest Teenager",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/nyregion/meet-supergirl-the-worlds-strongest-teenager.html

The Saudi coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, accuses Iran of trying to expand its influence into Arab countries, including Yemen, which shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, by aligning with the Houthis.

The coalition has targeted the Houthi rebels with deadly airstrikes. The Houthis, in turn, have launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Saudi territories, inflicting little damage but causing anxiety among Gulf monarchs, who have suspected cooperation between the rebels and Iran and Hezbollah.

The rebels’ claim of an attack on a nuclear power plant also comes days after Israel said it had destroyed an Iranian base near the Syrian city of al-Qiswa, southwest of Damascus, on Friday.

It is unclear if there were any casualties, since the base had not been completed. There has been no official Iranian reaction. Israel also has not commented on the reports. But it previously acknowledged carrying out repeated air and missile strikes in Syria since the beginning of the war six years ago, to stop arms deliveries to Hezbollah.

On Sunday, an Iranian analyst, Hamidreza Taraghi, who has close ties to Iran’s leaders, denied any the country had links to the missile attack claimed by the Yemen rebels.

“We have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Taraghi said. “The Houthis are very capable of hitting targets without our assistance.”

But Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia, and its allies insist that Iran has provided the Houthis with such weaponry and say that the rebels are taking commands from Tehran.

The Yemen rebels’ claim about striking a target in Abu Dhabi comes amid heavy fighting in Yemen’s capital, Sana, between the Shiite Houthi rebels and some of their former allies, who are led by former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.

Mr. Saleh, who stepped down in 2011 after a mass uprising against his 33 years in office, but he formed an alliance with the Houthis. Since then, fractures have emerged between the former leader and the rebels, exacerbating the crisis.

In a televised speech on Saturday, Mr. Saleh blamed the Houthis’ “idiocy” for the war in Yemen and declared that he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the coalition if it stopped the attacks on his country.

“I call upon the brothers in neighboring states and the alliance to stop their aggression, lift the siege, open the airports and allow food aid and the saving of the wounded and we will turn a new page by virtue of our neighborliness,” Mr. Saleh said.

In a statement carried by the Saudi-owned news outlet Al-Hadath, the coalition appeared to welcome Mr. Saleh’s remarks, saying it was “confident of the will of the leaders and sons” of Mr. Saleh’s political party to return to the fold.

Such a move by Mr. Saleh could pave the way to end the war, which has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe, unleashing signs of famine and outbreaks of cholera.

The apparent shift came as Mr. Saleh’s supporters battled Houthi fighters for a fourth day in the capital. A senior security officer at the Ministry of Interior in Sana said about 80 people have died and at least 140 more have been injured since fighting broke out.

The nuclear power plant, in Abu Dhabi’s far western desert, is being built by the Korea Electric Power Corporation near the border with Saudi Arabia and is scheduled to begin operating next year, the United Arab Emirates energy minister has said, according to The Associated Press.",U.A.E.

The federal government will run out of money and close its doors this month unless Congress can agree on a new spending bill. That’s one of several important pieces of business, albeit the most pressing, left unfinished during Republicans’ frantic drive to complete a tax bill.

Here are some others.

■ Nine million children covered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, have been waiting since Sept. 30 for Congress to renew the program. States are struggling to keep the program afloat; on Monday Colorado began sending letters to the families of 75,000 children and pregnant women, warning them that after Jan. 31 they’re on their own.

■ About 700,000 young people born to undocumented immigrants and at risk of deportation await a legislative alternative to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which, thanks to President Trump, is scheduled to end in March.

■ Victims of Western wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria are still waiting for tens of billions of dollars in additional federal aid promised weeks ago.

Congress’s priorities are clearly not the public’s. According to a survey last month by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans worry more about the children’s health program, the opioid epidemic, disaster recovery and finding a legal means for young immigrants to stay in the country than they do about the tax bill.","Tasks for Congress: Ignore President, Keep Government Open …",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/tasks-for-congress-ignore-president-keep-government-open.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Still, I paused over one line from Emba’s brief: “We won’t die of having less sex … Somehow, people will still find ways to meet, mate and propagate the species.”

People will, it’s true. But as a society we are actually in some serious trouble on the mating-and-propagation front.

When the sexual revolution started, its conservative critics warned it would replace marriage with a divorce-go-round, leave children without fathers, and expose women to more predation than before. Versions of these things happened, but over time various correctives, feminist and conservative, helped mitigate their worst effects. Divorce rates fell, sexual violence diminished, teen sex and pregnancy were reduced. In the last few years, even the out-of-wedlock birthrate has finally stopped climbing.

The cascade of revelations about powerful men is a continuation of this mitigation and correction process. But so far the process has not substituted successful marriages for failing ones, healthy relationships for exploitative ones, new courtship scripts for the ones torn up 50 years ago. Instead as Weinsteinian or Polanskian excesses have been corrected, we’ve increased singlehood, sterility and loneliness. We’ve achieved the goal of fewer divorces by having many fewer marriages. We’ve reduced promiscuity by substituting smartphones and pornography. We’ve leveled off out-of-wedlock births by entering into a major baby bust.

Part of the problem is economic: Everything from student debt to wage stagnation to child-rearing costs has eroded the substructure of the family, and policymakers have been pathetically slow to respond. Last week’s struggle to get the allegedly pro-family Republican Party to include help for parents in its tax reform is a frustrating illustration of the larger problem.

But there is also strong resistance to seeing a failure to unite the sexes and continue the species as a problem. If women are having fewer children, it must be because they want fewer children. (In fact most women want more children than they have.) If there are fewer marriages, they must at least be happier ones. (In fact they aren’t.) If the young are delaying parenthood, it must be that they are pursuing new opportunities and pleasures. (In fact the young seem increasingly medicated and miserable.) If men prefer video games and pornography to relationships, de gustibus non est disputandum.

A useful counterpoint to these assumptions was provided this week by my colleague Norimitsu Onishi, who wrote about the extraordinary loneliness of old age in Japan, a country that has lived with collapsed fertility and strained relations between the sexes for a generation. Japan’s aging, dying, atomized present is one version of our future — and a not-so-distant one, already visible in late-middle-age despair and elder exploitation.

I don’t know what new-old mix of mating rituals and expectations and supports could arrest Japanification. I don’t think either feminism or social conservatism at present have the answer. And I’m sure there is nothing worth saving in the predatory sexual culture currently being put to the torch by victims and journalists.

But any moral progress will be limited, any sexual and romantic future darkened, until we can figure out what might be rebuilt in the ashes.",The Sterile Society,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/the-sterile-society.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
