Their green feet come courtesy of a fluorescent green jelly fish gene added to their own genome.
This allows a team of British scientists to test out gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
And I think you know the opportunities with this are really exciting and really profound.
Last year two teams of U.S. based scientists used CRISPR-Cas9 technology in mice to correct the genetic mutation that causes sickle cell disease.
Other potential applications of the technology could be to make food crops and livestock animal species disease-resistant.

These are no Frankenstein mice. Their green feet come courtesy of a fluorescent green jelly fish gene added to their own genome. This allows a team of British scientists to test out gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. SOUNDBITE (English) UNIVERSITY OF BATH REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGIST, DR ANTHONY PERRY, SAYING: "We take what were or would have been green embryos and we make them into non-green embryos, so it's a really great way of demonstrating the method." The technique uses the ribonucleic acid molecule CRISPR together with the Cas9 protein enzyme. CRISPR guides the Cas9 protein to a defective part of a genome where it acts like molecular scissors to cut out a specific part of the DNA. This could revolutionise how we treat diseases with a genetic component, like sickle cell anaemia. The technique is being pioneered in the U.S. SOUNDBITE (English) PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, JENNIFER DOUDNA, SAYING: "We now have a technology that allows correction of a sequence that would lead to normally functioning cells. And I think you know the opportunities with this are really exciting and really profound. There are many diseases that are have known genetic causes that we now have in principle a way to cure." Last year two teams of U.S. based scientists used CRISPR-Cas9 technology in mice to correct the genetic mutation that causes sickle cell disease. Although researchers aren't yet close to using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit human embryos for implantation into the womb - some are already warning against it. SOUNDBITE (English) DIRECTOR OF HUMAN GENETICS ALERT, DR DAVID KING,SAYING: "It will immediately create this new form of what we call consumer eugenics, that's to say eugenics driven by the free market and consumer preferences in which people choose the cosmetic characteristics and the abilities of their children and try to basically enhance their children to perform better than other people's children." Other potential applications of the technology could be to make food crops and livestock animal species disease-resistant. The British team say CRISPR-Cas9 presents a golden opportunity to prevent genetic disease.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s top court on Friday sentenced Habib Shartouni to death for the 1982 assassination of president-elect Bashir Gemayel, an event that was a turning point in Lebanon’s 15-year civil war.
Lebanese policemen are seen in front of a court building in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.
His assassination occurred during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.

Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.

He was quoted in an interview in Lebanon’s al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in Syria between 1994 and 2004. He did not reveal his present location.

Gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with Israel. His assassination occurred during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.

His death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on Sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many Lebanese and triggered the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut’s Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.

Supporters of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) carry a banner with pictures of Nabil al Alam (L) and Habib Shartouni (R) during a protest outside a court building in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.

Supporters of both Shartouni and Gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.

Gemayel was head of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, Muslim and Palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by Israel.

Its invasion was aimed at driving from Lebanon the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as well as the Syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.

After his assassination, Israel entered the capital Beirut and allowed Gemayel’s militia, the Lebanese Forces, to access the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps, where their fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.

Gemayel’s family is still one of the most important in Lebanese politics, heading the Kataeb party that was founded by his father. The Lebanese Forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, Samir Geagea.

American economist Richard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on how human nature affects supposedly rational markets.
Thaler's research showed how traits, such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have, prompt decisions that may not be the best in the longer term.
The University of Chicago professor is a pioneer of the so-called "nudge" theory, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors.
He wrote a book about it, and that caught the eye of policymakers around the world.
Thaler also made a cameo in the 2015 film about the great recession "The Big Short" explaining the so-called "hot-hand fallacy" where past success is expected to also warrant success in the future.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German industrial gases group Linde (LING.DE) has passed an important threshold in its exchange offer for the planned $80 billion (£60.6 billion) merger with U.S. peer Praxair (PX.N).
Linde Chief Executive Officer Aldo Belloni (L-R) and Praxair Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel shake hands at a news conference in Munich, Germany June 2, 2017.
REUTERS/Michaela RehleLinde said on Friday that shareholders representing 50.85 percent of its capital have accepted the offer, as an Oct. 24 deadline approaches to reach 75 percent acceptance.
Passing the 50 percent threshold paves the way for passive funds, such as exchanged-traded funds replicating Germany’s blue chip DAX index, to also tender their shares.
Roughly 10-13 percent of Linde’s shares are held by such funds and one UK fund already tendered its shares on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

Speaking to reporters at the end of a two-day EU summit in Brussels, Merkel said it was “very clear” what British Prime Minister Theresa May had to do to break a deadlock in the talks that has prevented a discussion about Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the bloc, known as “phase two”.

“We hope that by December we have moved along enough to allow phase two to begin but that depends on the extent to which Great Britain makes progress so that we can say that it is sufficient on the core themes of phase one,” Merkel told a news conference at the end of an EU summit.

She said that the main obstacle was Britain’s failure so far to signal a readiness to settle financial obligations to the bloc that EU officials estimate at around 60 billion euros.

May, under severe domestic pressure after a botched election in June that saw her Conservatives lose their majority, has said that Britain will stand by its financial commitments to the EU without offering figures.

“I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,” Merkel said.

Asked about suggestions from May that Britain could pursue a two-year transitional deal once it leaves the bloc in 2019 in order to buy time to clinch a more comprehensive agreement, Merkel said this was not the primary focus for now.

“The two-year transition phase is an interesting idea, no question. But it is not part of phase one of the negotiations,” she said. “So it is there in the room and will be discussed at the proper time.”

The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe was assigned the patents by SRC Labs LLC in August, in a deal intended to use the tribe’s sovereign status to shield them from administrative review.

SRC is also a plaintiff in the case.

Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.

The tribe, which would receive a share of any award, made a similar deal in September to hold patents for Allergan on its dry eye medicine Restasis.

SRC and Allergan made the deals to shield their patents from review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court run by the U.S. patent office that frequently revokes patents. The tribe would get revenue to address environmental damage and rising healthcare costs.

Companies sued for patent infringement in federal court often respond by asking the patent board to invalidate the asserted patents. Both Microsoft and Amazon have used this strategy to prevail in previous disputes.

A federal court in Texas separately invalidated Allergan’s Restasis patents on Monday. The company responded that it would appeal that ruling.

Allergan’s deal with the tribe has drawn criticism from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, some of whom have called it a “sham.” Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill on Oct. 5 introduced a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty.

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Famous artist Jan Fabre brings his fresh show "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" to Moscow - his Antwerp theater's first gig in Russia since 2009. "I'm making a kind of a critical love declaration to my country. Belgium is like Russia," Fabre said. "We are world powers. We are bigger than China, bigger than Russia, bigger than America. No, it's not true. We are so small. So 'Belgium Rules' is quite ironical, because we never historically had any militaristic power, any economical power." A four-hour performance balances between acute satire and tender sentiment and takes the audience on an ironic tour through the author's motherland. Sparkles and glitter hail on pompous plumes of carnival dresses as dancers in wooden clogs tap the rhythm of a Belgian fiesta. "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" includes Belgian specialties like its beer, chocolate, bicycles and smoking pipes to grotesque masquerade, exposing all the vices of Belgian society and questioning its rules. "My aim as an artist is to evoke the minds of spectators, to make spectators feel and think in a different way," Fabre said. "But this is never in the working process - oh, we're gonna shock or provoke people. Never." The performance is interlaced with elegant living pictures reminiscent of the works of the country's famous painters. "Don't forget - we are a country that created oil painting," Fabre said proudly ahead of his show that pays homage to Hieronymus Bosch's "Ship of Fools" painting, Pieter Bruegel's snowy fields and the misty lands of Rene Magritte. "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" was brought to Russia by the Territory festival - a platform which has promoted modern theater in Russia since 2005.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - PayPal’s future rests on striking a quadruple whammy.
The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - PayPal’s future rests on striking a quadruple whammy. The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up. At 31 times the next 12 months’ estimated earnings, it trades at a higher multiple than Visa or MasterCard. Justifying such a rapid rise requires Chief Executive Dan Schulman to execute well on four crucial strategies.

PayPal’s split from eBay in 2015 helped the company to capture multiple tailwinds as consumers increased their shift toward more convenient payment options than cash and checks – and grew increasingly impatient with the slow pace of technological change at traditional banks. The rise of e-commerce has helped, too. The biggest benefit, however, is the growth of smartphones.

Mobile transactions are growing about 50 percent annually, and now account for more than a third of volume, according to the company. PayPal’s Venmo service has even faster velocity. It’s a payments-cum-social media service that lets people send money to each other for free and post comments about what it’s for. Venmo handled $9 billion of payments last quarter, 93 percent more than the same period last year.

Trouble is, Schulman’s outfit gets precious little financial benefit for this service. Charging merchants to take Venmo payments, a service which launched this week, should change that. The risk is that the millennials who made the person-to-person feature so successful may balk at paying stores in the same manner.

Schulman’s second challenge is to ensure PayPal’s burgeoning lending business doesn’t overheat. The company’s loan portfolio now exceeds $6 billion, but the bigger it gets, the more investors will worry about rising defaults, which could drive down PayPal’s stock multiple. He also needs to make progress on his goal of increasing average usage of PayPal from two to three times a month toward his aspirational goal of two to three times a week.

Finally, Schulman needs to renegotiate the firm’s contract with eBay that expires in 2020. That accounted for 22 percent of revenue last year. There’s a lot of mutual dependence that ought to mean the odds of a split are low. But eBay has plenty of options. That Square could lose Starbucks and Costco could ditch American Express should convince Schulman to tread carefully.

He does, though, have momentum on his side. The future is his to lose.

FRANCOFORTE, 18 ottobre (Reuters) - SpringerNature, editore delle riviste scientifiche ‘Nature’ e ‘Scientific American’, sta preparando uno sbarco in borsa nel 2018 che valuta la società fino a 4 miliardi di euro.

Lo riferiscono alcune fonti vicine al dossier.

La società di recente ha sondato le banche per l‘operazione che dovrebbe avvenire già a giugno o luglio 2018 per consentire l‘uscita di uno degli azionisti, secondo le fonti.

SpringerNature è una joint venture controllata al 53% dall‘editore tedesco Holtzbrinck e per il resto dall‘operatore di private equity BC Partners.

E’ nata nel 2015 dalla fusione della divisione Macmillan Science and Education di Holtzbrinck con il business Springer di BC Partners, che pubblica libri e riviste scientifici, tecnici e medici. All‘epoca la società venne valutata più di 5 miliardi di euro incluso il debito.

BC Partners non ha voluto commentare, mentre Holtzbrinck non è stata raggiungibile per un commento nell‘immediato.

Secondo una delle fonti, Holtzbrinck potrebbe voler tenere la maggioranza dopo la quotazione.

SpringerNature, che pubblica circa 3.000 riviste scientifiche e circa 12.000 nuovi libri ogni anno, dovrebbe realizzare l‘anno prossimo un Ebitda di 480 milioni di euro e potrebbe essere valutata, secondo una fonte, fino a 6,5-7 miliardi incluso il debito per 3 miliardi.

Una simile valutazione corrisponde a 15-16 volte l‘Ebitda escludendo gli investimenti, ha aggiunto la fonte. Nel 2015 BC Partners ha detto che puntava a una quotazione del business entro due o tre anni.

The UK's decision to leave the EU has at times left British Prime Minister Theresa May looking like the unpopular kid at school. Not so on Thursday (October 19). The choreography on the first day of this European Union summit showing May talking animatedly with the EU's most important leaders - France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel. That as May urged a new dynamic on Brexit talks. At a summit dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May appealed to EU leaders to help her silence her critics at home and break a deadlock in the talks. Merkel responding to that with words of support. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING: "Contrary to how it is sometimes represented in the British press - this process is moving forward step by step. Sometimes the impression is given that after just a few weeks we should now already be announcing the end. To be clear, I find that absolutely absurd." Talks have stalled largely over how much Britain owes when it leaves the bloc. EU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill. They are expected on Friday (October 20) to set a target of December for London to improve its divorce settlement offer. But in a conciliatory gesture they are also likely to call on their staff to prepare for the next stage of talks. That may be enough for May to stave off calls by several Brexit campaigners back home for her to walk away from the negotiating table.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Friday in see-saw trade, under pressure from weak U.S. demand but drawing support from a sharp decline in Iraqi crude exports due to tensions in the Kurdistan region.
Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.
Olivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.
“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year.

U.S. light crude CLc1 was 10 cents higher at $51.39. Brent crude LCOc1 was up 24 cents at $57.47 a barrel by 11:44 a.m. EST.

“We’ve continued to see signs that the market needs a steady drumbeat of positive information,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research for Tradition Energy. “This week’s DOE report where gasoline demand dropped to its lowest since March gave a little pause to that.”

Oil exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan via the Turkish port of Ceyhan were flowing at average rates of 216,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from the usual flows of around 600,000 bpd, a shipping source said.

Iraqi troops regained control of two major oilfields northwest of Kirkuk from Kurdish Peshmerga forces this week, and the oil ministry in Baghdad expects to bring the fields back on stream on Sunday.

Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.

Olivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.

Analysts said the market was on a path toward rebalancing.

“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.

U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year. C-STK-T-EIA

Part of this drawdown has been due to rising exports as a result of the steep discount of U.S. crude to Brent, which makes it attractive for American producers to export their oil. CL-LCO1=R

Crude oil for immediate use now carries a premium over forward futures, making it profitable to sell oil produced now rather than storing it for sale later.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that overseas U.S. crude oil shipments have soared from virtually zero before the government loosened export restrictions in late 2015 to around 2.6 million bpd in October.

“While outbound shipments recently approached 2 million bpd, our math suggests that physical bottlenecks are unlikely to kick in until waterborne exports approach 3.2 million bpd,” RBC Capital Markets said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - France wants to take action to tackle Iran’s missile programme and “destabilising” behaviour but believes scrapping the 2015 nuclear deal would help hardliners and be a step towards future war, France’s defence minister said on Friday.
French Minister for the Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly delivers a speech after handing over the Strategic document on Defense and National Security to the French President at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, October 13, 2017.
Scrapping it would be a gift to Iran’s hardiners, and a first step towards future wars,” Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank, referring to the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
We are working on it.”Parly is the first French minister to visit the United States since President Donald Trump’s refusal to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

“We need the JCPOA. Scrapping it would be a gift to Iran’s hardiners, and a first step towards future wars,” Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank, referring to the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

“But we should also be very serious about the destabilising ballistic and regional activities. We are working on it.”

Parly is the first French minister to visit the United States since President Donald Trump’s refusal to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. She held talks with her American counterpart James Mattis and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.

While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between Iran and six world powers. That has alarmed its European allies, who fear the deal will slowly unravel.

“The issue is now in Congress. France has no desire to be embroiled in U.S. domestic politics, but our position on the agreement is clear.”

The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga, who says he will boycott a presidential election re-run due next week, said on Friday he would announce a “way forward” the day before the scheduled poll, raising the possibility he might participate after all.

At a memorial in western Kenya for opposition supporters killed in protests against the vote set for Oct. 26, Odinga told his supporters not to attack “innocent people” including people who support his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta.

He did not comment on an announcement by the electoral board chief executive Ezra Chiloba earlier on Friday that he would take three weeks’ leave.

Kenya is holding the re-run after the Supreme Court threw out the result of an Aug. 8 election won by the incumbent Kenyatta but disputed by the challenger Odinga. The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud.

The opposition has demanded Chiloba resign, and the announcement that he will not participate in running the vote suggests progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations involving Western diplomats and religious and civil society leaders.

Uncertainty over whether Odinga will participate in the election and concerns that it may not proceed peacefully have left Kenya, a traditionally stable Western ally in an often chaotic region, mired in political crisis.

The volatile build-up to the Oct. 26 vote has revived memories for Kenyans of ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a disputed election in 2007, when Odinga also lost and disputed the result.

Chiloba told Reuters that, in light of the opposition’s demands, he was going on leave, and that all arrangements for next week’s vote were in place.

At least 45 people died nationwide in a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the August vote, including a six-month old baby struck on the head by a police baton.

With Odinga yet to respond to Chiloba’s decision to go on leave, diplomats said they were unsure what would happen next.

“The crystal ball is very cloudy at the moment,” a senior western diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters. “The situation is changing by the hour.”

REVIEW OF BOYCOTT?

The electoral board has said next week’s election will go ahead. Odinga met its chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday and later told reporters that if there were serious consultations and serious reforms, the opposition could review its boycott.

Chebukati had said a day earlier that he could not guarantee the election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against colleagues. A fellow board member resigned this week after fleeing to the United States, saying she feared for her life.

The opposition has held near-daily protests demanding electoral reforms and the sacking of board officials. Police said on Friday four people were killed as a result of their interventions to stop demonstrations.

Kenyatta has meanwhile urged Kenyans to come out in large numbers to vote, insisting the ballot be held. On Thursday, he snubbed an invitation to meet Chebukati, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning.

In a speech in Nairobi on Friday, Kenyatta said the election must not divide the nation or push it to the brink.

Disruptions of the vote by “those who thrive in chaos and relish anarchy” would not be tolerated, and security forces “have been enhanced and appropriately deployed to maintain law and order”, he said.

Signs of poor demand for the iPhone 8 sent Apple's stock lower on Thursday. Canada's largest mobile network Rogers Communication said appetite for the product has been "anemic." Verizon also admitted that the number of upgrades in the third quarter was lower than in previous years. A newspaper in Taiwan reported Apple has cut production orders on iPhone 8 by more than 50 percent for the rest of the year. A number of sector analysts played down the concerns. Michael Bapis of Bapis Group at HighTower: (SOUNDBITE) MICHAEL BAPIS, PARTNER, BAPIS GROUP AT HIGHTOWER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "You might see a pullback in Apple.

SkyAlert has also found a market selling alarms to small businesses in the capital, said its co-founder and director Alvaro Velasco. And it is looking to expand to Latin America, mainly Colombia, Peru and Chile, which lack an official alerting system despite frequent quakes in those countries.

Velasco said that he and SkyAlert co-founder Alejandro Cantú are talking to investors from Mexico and elsewhere about raising 100 million pesos ($5.35 million) in capitalization in 2018.

He said the surge in users after the most recent deadly quake in Mexico City had heightened the interest of existing investors including U.S.-based American Messaging and attracted interest from two Mexico-based private equity funds.

American Messaging did not respond to requests to comment on any potential new investment.

Velasco said SkyAlert was in talks with those funds and existing investors to inject around 20 million pesos (1.05 million dollars) into SkyAlert.

Still, finding a sustainable business model for the quake monitoring app has been a challenge partly because recent regulation in Mexico City has limited SkyAlert’s ability to access funds through public financing.

MAKING A PROFIT NOT EASY

Shomit Ghose at Onset Ventures, a U.S. private equity company with experience in software start-ups, said quake apps have struggled to get adequate financing because of the lack of a clear path to profits.

“If the business model is B2B where the earthquake early-warning is sent to companies, or railways, or hospitals, or high-buildings then perhaps a strong B2B case can be made for start-up investment,” Ghose said.

SkyAlert’s predicament echoes that of companies seeking funding to develop earthquake alert apps in the United States. Seismic activity is hard to monetize without government support.

It competes with its former partner, Mexico’s official alerting system run by government-funded non profit CIRES, which was created after an earthquake in 1985 killed thousands in the country.

One of the world’s few widely deployed seismic alarms, CIRES runs a network of sirens positioned around Mexico City that warn of a coming quake. SkyAlert mainly warns people through a mobile app.

Both sell quake warning systems, but a 2016 regulatory reform requires public buildings in Mexico City to purchase alarm systems from CIRES, limiting SkyAlert’s public financing.

SkyAlert initially replicated CIRES’ alerts, but in 2015 it decided to deploy its own detection sensors to increase coverage with greater accuracy, Velasco said.

“After a few false alerts from CIRES that affected SkyAlert’s credibility, we decided to invest in our own technology,” he said.

SkyAlert also is exploring ways to monetize its free app.

Currently, it sells a “premium” version for $4 a year that allows users to personalize alerts. However, Mexico has an average per capita income of $8,200, and the company said only around 4 percent of users pay for it.

Velasco said SkyAlert’s revenue is split fairly evenly between those fees and income from selling to businesses.

The newest version of the app allows for paid advertising, but ads would not be visible during a seismic alert.

SkyAlert, founded in 2011, has few peers, but one similar service in Japan is called YureKuru Call, which relies on government seismic data. YureKuru has received some government funding on an ad-hoc basis, but like SkyAlert is mostly funded by fees, said Rina Suzuki, an official at RC Solution Co., the Tokyo-based firm that developed YureKuru.

Detection technologies are evolving and they are all perfectible, Jennifer Strauss, external relations officer at the Berkeley Seismology Lab told Reuters.

“In the end, what matters is how effective they are at alerting people to save lives,” said Strauss.

FRANCOFORTE (Reuters) - I supervisori della Banca Centrale Europea devono rivedere le proposte sulla gestione dei crediti problematici dopo le lamentele dell‘Italia secondo cui potrebbero ostacolare la ripresa del paese.

Lo riferiscono a Reuters quattro fonti senior della banca centrale a Reuters, tutte vicine all‘organo decisionale della Bce. La Bce non ha invece commentato.

Entro marzo l‘Ssm, il meccanismo unico di supervisione della Bce, deve mettere a punto nuove regole sugli accantonamenti delle banche a fronte dei crediti problematici. Il tema è spinoso per le banche italiane che raccolgono oltre un quarto degli 865 miliardi di euro di crediti deteriorati della zona euro.

“C‘è il serio rischio che la proposta in arrivo dall‘Ssm sia troppo soft”, dice una delle fonti.

L‘Ssm sta lavorando su quattro scenari modellati sulle linee guida attuali per i nuovi crediti problematici, che danno alle banche sette anni di tempo per la copertura su quelli garantiti e due anni per quelli non garantiti.

Secondo uno di questi scenari le banche dovranno cominciare a effettuare gli accantonamenti immediatamente, anche se gradualmente. Uno scenario più generoso invece fermerebbe l‘orologio di uno o due anni, dando tempo alle banche fino al 2021 o al 2026 per raggiungere l‘obiettivo.

Ora tutto è in discussione. “Anche lo scenario più generoso potrebbe apparire troppo severo”, spiega la fonte. “È tutto in divenire”.

Le linee guida della Bce saranno influenzate anche dalla proposta di legge che la Commissione Ue sta preparando in parallelo e che potrebbe riguardare anche misure per gli accantonamenti, aggiungono le fonti. Questo per evitare rischi di contrasti con Bruxelles dopo che il presidente del Parlamento Ue Antonio Tajani ha apertamente messo in discussione l‘autorità della Bce sulla materia agitando lo spettro di una disputa tra le due istituzioni.

Nello scenario più estremo, riferito da una delle fonti, in cui l‘Ssm probabilmente resta sulle sue posizioni, i supervisori pubblicheranno dei criteri che poi potrebbero essere differentemente applicati nei diversi paesi e per le diverse categorie di istituti.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation’s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct. 19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels, reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts.

The move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn-states like Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and Valero Energy Corp who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief.

The letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months. The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul.

The most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said..

The so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said.

Pruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas.

Pruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies.

Those ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

But Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration’s promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers.

“It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,” Grassley said in a statement.

In the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog.

Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was “grateful for Administrator Pruitt’s epiphany on the road to the RFS.”

The program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a coalition of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program.

“If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,” Blair said.

Honeywell’s shares rose as much as 1.5 percent to a record high of $145.80 in morning trading on Friday.

The company now expects total sales of $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion from $39.3 billion to $40.0 billion estimated previously. Full-year sales growth forecast, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, was raised to 3-4 percent from 2-4 percent.

The company’s performance materials and technologies (PMT) division, which makes catalysts and adsorbents used for petroleum and refining industries among other things, is also benefiting as demand from oil and gas industry remains robust.

Last week, the company said it would pare its focus to four business lines, including aerospace, and spin off two businesses with $7.5 billion in revenue to help fund acquisitions.

The company was under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb and his hedge fund Third Point LLC to spin off its aerospace business.

Sales in Honeywell’s aerospace business, its biggest, rose 4 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, while its PMT unit’s sales jumped 10 percent in the quarter.

Net income attributable to Honeywell rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.75 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.24 billion, or $1.60 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $10.12 billion.

The U.S. industrial conglomerate also reaffirmed its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings per share.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales unexpectedly fell in August, pointing to a slowdown in growth after a hot first half of the year and bolstering expectations the Bank of Canada will refrain from hiking interest rates again next week.

Separate data from Statistics Canada on Friday showed the annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent in September, matching forecasts and the highest in five months.

Markets and economists focused on the retail sales report, which showed sales fell 0.3 percent, against forecasts for a 0.5 percent increase. Volumes declined 0.7 percent, the biggest decrease since March 2016.

Analysts said the figures were in line with anticipated slower economic growth in the second half of the year after a strong performance that put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven.

“The Canadian economy is notably cooling down after the remarkable run it had up until about the middle part of the year,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

“The retail sales result does fit with that pattern of somewhat more modest activity.”

It also solidified bets the Bank of Canada will hold interest rates at 1.0 percent when it meets next week after two back-to-back increases. Market odds of no move rose to 81 percent from 72.8 percent before the data was released. [CA/POLL]

The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback following the two reports. [CAD/]

The decline in sales was led by a 2.5 percent drop at food and beverage stores, as well as stores that are typically linked to home purchases and renovations.

The increase in September’s inflation rate was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey, as well as more expensive food and shelter costs.

While underlying measures of inflation firmed somewhat, economists said they were still far enough away from the central bank’s 2 percent target to allow policymakers to take their time raising rates from here.

CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rose to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

Still, many are betting the central bank will have room to hike again in December, with market odds at 47.2 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Verizon’s perch as the No. 1 carrier in the United States looks secure. The $200 billion telecom firm reported a rise in wireless subscribers on Thursday. But the gap is narrowing. Cable rivals Comcast and Charter are also offering mobile services, AT&T is trying to become a media company and Sprint and T-Mobile may yet merge. A heavy debt load hobbles Verizon’s ability to quickly change lanes.

Verizon said it had a net addition of more than 600,000 wireless customers, including those for tablets and other devices, who pay a monthly bill in the third quarter. Earnings were flat at $3.7 billion, but $10 billion in cost savings targeted by Chief Executive Lowell McAdam over the next four years should help the bottom line.

Looming over Verizon is the chance that Sprint and T-Mobile US may finally combine. The third and fourth carriers in the United States argue that a tie-up would better position them to compete against Verizon and its peer AT&T. Adding to the pressure, both Comcast and Charter Communications are launching their own mobile initiatives. Sure, Comcast is using Verizon’s backbone for cellular but it would be unwise to underestimate the ability of Brian Roberts’ company to turn foe.

The options for Verizon to buy its way out of trouble are limited. Three years ago the telecom firm closed a $130 billion purchase of the remaining 45 percent stake of the venture Verizon Wireless from Vodafone. The amount of debt on the balance sheet - $117 billion as of the end of September – gives it limited flexibility.

There is a possibility of a bid for satellite distributor Dish, which has an enterprise value of about $40 billion, but AT&T sounds a cautious note about how big deals can pan out. The second-largest mobile carrier warned earlier it lost 90,000 U.S. video subscribers in the third quarter because of competition and weather. AT&T bought satellite firm DirecTV in 2015 for $67 billion and is preparing to close on its $109 billion deal for Time Warner.

McAdam may yet choose to copy AT&T’s media strategy and go beyond the $9 billion or so he spent on AOL and Yahoo, though paying a premium may be a stretch. Verizon has boasted of raising its dividend for 11 years in a row. If it sticks to that, it risks being stuck in neutral.

Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen major companies in technology and other industries are planning to launch a coalition to demand legislation that would allow young, illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The Coalition for the American Dream intends to ask Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “Dreamers,” to continue working in the United States, the documents said.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows.

Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

“We’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,” Intel spokesman Will Moss said in a statement.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

Many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.

“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview earlier on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.

“You will see this continue to escalate until the end of the year,” he said.

“We need the JCPOA. Scrapping it would be a gift to Iran’s hardiners, and a first step towards future wars,” Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank, referring to the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

“But we should also be very serious about the destabilising ballistic and regional activities. We are working on it.”

Parly is the first French minister to visit the United States since President Donald Trump’s refusal to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. She held talks with her American counterpart James Mattis and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.

While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between Iran and six world powers. That has alarmed its European allies, who fear the deal will slowly unravel.

“The issue is now in Congress. France has no desire to be embroiled in U.S. domestic politics, but our position on the agreement is clear.”

Airbus expects to sell 'thousands' of CSeries jets - CEO

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Friday he believed Bombardier Inc’s CSeries planes would capture half the market for smaller single-aisle aircraft with the sale of “thousands” of the 110-to-130 seat jets.
The logo of Airbus is pictured at the company's headquarters in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, October 19, 2017.
Customers will likely remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.
Commercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.
Brazil’s Embraer and Canada’s Bombardier compete in the market between 100 and 150 seats as well as in the market for smaller regional jets.

“I see no reason why we should not be able to capture 50 percent of that market,” Enders said in Montreal at a breakfast organized by the city’s chamber of commerce. “I think we will sell thousands.”

Europe’s largest aerospace group on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program for $1, a move expected to reduce costs while bolstering the plane’s sales and giving Canada’s Bombardier a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing Co and U.S. regulators.

The lightweight, carbon-composite jet, which costs $6 billion to develop, has won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months.

On Thursday, the head of a major U.S. airplane leasing company said the deal boosts confidence in the CSeries program, but is unlikely to drive a flurry of immediate sales.

Customers will likely remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.

Some analysts have suggested that Airbus’s 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries could reverberate throughout the aerospace industry, triggering a riposte from other planemakers, including Boeing itself.

Commercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.

Brazil’s Embraer and Canada’s Bombardier compete in the market between 100 and 150 seats as well as in the market for smaller regional jets.

Enders, who addressed Montreal’s business leaders with Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare, said the industry-changing venture would have a ripple effect, but didn’t specify what he meant further. “New alliances will be formed,” he said.

Merseyside Police are also investigating the brawl on the pitch between players from both teams, while Everton have banned one individual.

“Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA Europa League group stage match between Everton FC and Olympique Lyonnais (1-2), played on 19 October in England,” UEFA said in a statement on Friday.

The governing body added that the English club had been charged with “Aggressions by supporters against players” under Article 16 (2) (H) of its disciplinary regulations.

Everton captain Ashley Williams sparked off the trouble in the 64th minute when he shoved Anthony Lopes into the advertising hoardings after the Lyon goalkeeper had collected the ball from a corner.

An all-out melee ensued with players from both sides getting involved, while at least one fan behind the goal was caught on video throwing punches at a Lyon player before stewards intervened.

Everton issued a statement saying they had banned an individual from future matches after reviewing footage of the incident and would be making a formal complaint to Merseyside Police.

The force said its detectives would review footage and speak to witnesses to establish what, if any, offences had been committed.

WALES FRUSTRATION AFFECTING WILLIAMS

Everton manager Ronald Koeman said on Friday that Williams had acted out of frustration born partly from Wales’s failure to qualify for the World Cup and needed to control his emotions better.

“I understand his situation yesterday,” the manager told a press conference ahead of Sunday’s Premier League home game against Arsenal.

”His personal situation, it was difficult after (being knocked) out of the World (Cup following the qualifiers) with Wales. He had some mistakes that cost a goal but I like that mentality.

“From frustration you get maybe more aggression and that’s not bad. But you need to control yourself.”

The defender, who scored an equaliser for Everton minutes after the incident, and Lyon striker Bertrand Traore, who got the winner for his side, received yellow cards for their parts in the struggle.

Koeman also praised his skipper for his leadership on the pitch.

”He showed his face yesterday, he played well,“ he added. ”He was a captain on the pitch and of course in the situation of the brawl he needs to control himself.

“But okay, on one side I understand frustration, disappointment, because everybody was disappointed.”

The loss increases scrutiny of Koeman, whose team sit bottom of their group with no wins in three Europa League games and on a two-game winless streak in the Premier League, where they are 16th in the standings.

White and male: broader bureaucracy mirrors Trump cabinet's profile

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Now, recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader Trump administration shows that with over 1,000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male.
Office of Personnel Management numbers analyzed by Reuters show that 88 percent of such appointees were non-Hispanic white and 62 percent were men.
In fact, this administration’s numbers are similar to those under the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush.
In 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population.
Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump faced criticism from advocacy groups for not including more women and minorities in his cabinet last January, the incoming administration promised that the lower rungs of the bureaucracy would ultimately look more diverse.

Now, recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader Trump administration shows that with over 1,000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male.

Office of Personnel Management numbers analyzed by Reuters show that 88 percent of such appointees were non-Hispanic white and 62 percent were men.

By comparison, in the final year of Barack Obama's Democratic administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 67 percent of that group and men accounted for 47 percent - closer to what the U.S. population looks like. Non-Hispanic whites account for 61 percent and men make up 49 percent, according to 2016 census data. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xOf1ip)

“This administration so far has not in any direct sense prioritized diversity,” said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan group that tracks federal hiring, when presented with Reuters’ findings.

Out of the Trump administration’s 24 top cabinet-level positions, 17 are filled by white men.

Asked to comment on the mid-level personnel data, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump had a long history of promoting women and pointed to last week’s nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

“He will continue to elevate and empower women to top posts in his administration,” Walters said. She declined to discuss Trump’s views on the ethnicity of political appointees.

One day before Trump took office on Jan. 20, his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet’s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.

“People (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration,” he told reporters.

The mid-level political positions, known as “Schedule C” and “non-career SES” posts, numbered 1,051 in June, according to most recent data published in late September.

U.S. President Donald Trump is surrounded by his cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (L-R), Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Linda McMahon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tom Price, as he signs an executive order entitled "Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch" in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2017.

How many more of those jobs have been filled since and whether their demographics has changed will be known at the end of the year, when third quarter numbers are expected.

CRITICAL LINK

The positions include office managers, aides, policy experts and schedulers who are hired by top appointees, such as cabinet secretaries and their deputies. The mid-level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations.

In recent decades, such jobs would account for about half of some 4,000 positions that get filled anew with every change of administration. The OPM does not publish data on the more senior positions.

The personnel office has published data sorted by gender that goes back to 1998 and by ethnicity since 2006, allowing comparisons with only two past administrations.

Some political analysts say the profile of the new group of mid-level officials largely reflects a lower share of minorities among Republican voters and the fact that the Republican party has weaker ties to organizations that promote diversity and gender equality.

“It’s just a smaller set of folks who organize around those things and are connected to the Republican party,” said David Lewis, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential appointments.

In fact, this administration’s numbers are similar to those under the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush. Between 2006-2008, the only Bush years covered by OPM gender, race and ethnicity data, men made up 60 percent of mid-level staff and 88 percent described themselves as non-Hispanic white.

However, the United States has become more diverse over the past decade, making the numbers for this administration less representative of America’s demographic makeup than was the case under Bush.

In 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population. Now that share is 4 percentage points lower, U.S. Census figures show.

Among Republican registered voters, the share of those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white has edged down from 88 percent in 2008 to 86 percent just before the 2016 presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.

Women also have a larger share of overall U.S. jobs than during the Bush years. Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008. In 1998-2000, the final years of Bill Clinton’s presidency captured in the OPM data, that share averaged 51 percent.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
LONDON (Reuters) - Pollution is killing millions of people worldwide, mostly through the diseases it causes including heart conditions, strokes and lung cancer, according to a large international study.
And in rapidly industrialising countries such as India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Madagascar, pollution is linked to as many as a quarter of all fatalities.
The study found pollution was linked to around nine million deaths in 2015.
Dirty air - caused by everything from transport and industry to indoor fires - was the biggest contributor linked to 6.5 million deaths, it said.
The greatest numbers of deaths linked to pollution in that year were in India with 2.5 million, and China with 1.8 million.

Almost all pollution-related deaths - around 92 percent - are in poor or middle-income countries, the research found. And in rapidly industrialising countries such as India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Madagascar, pollution is linked to as many as a quarter of all fatalities.

“Pollution is much more than an environmental challenge – it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,” said Philip Landrigan, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the United States who co-led the study.

The study found pollution was linked to around nine million deaths in 2015.

Dirty air - caused by everything from transport and industry to indoor fires - was the biggest contributor linked to 6.5 million deaths, it said.

The next biggest was polluted water that spread gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections and killed 1.8 million people.

The greatest numbers of deaths linked to pollution in that year were in India with 2.5 million, and China with 1.8 million.

The research, conducted by about 40 international scientists, used data from the Global Burden of Disease study from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. It was published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday.

MILANO (Reuters) - (L‘autrice è una columnist di Reuters Breakingviews. Le opinioni espresse sono solo le sue)

Un cambio al vertice, per la Banca d‘Italia, è la migliore tra diverse opzioni negative.

Il bilancio con luci ed ombre del governatore Ignazio Visco durante la crisi bancaria italiana indebolisce l‘ipotesi di un rinnovo del suo mandato. Le critiche dei politici nei suoi confronti minacciano l‘indipendenza della banca centrale e potrebbero sconsigliare una sua sostituzione. Ma se Visco restasse al suo posto, rischierebbe di diventare in un‘anatra zoppa.

Il mandato di Visco scade alla fine del mese. Fino a lunedì la riconferma del governatore per altri sei anni sembrava una mera formalità. Adesso invece non è più certa, dopo che martedì la Camera ha approvato una mozione del Pd critica sul ruolo svolto da Bankitalia durante la crisi delle banche e dopo che giovedì l‘ex premier Silvio Berlusconi è intervenuto nello stesso senso.

Ci sono buoni motivi per criticare Visco. La banca centrale non è riuscita a individuare le enormi perdite da derivati occultate del Monte dei Paschi. Lo scandalo, scoperto a inizio 2013, si è concluso col salvataggio di Stato della banca toscana.

Visco è stato anche lento nel costringere le banche italiane a far emergere i crediti in sofferenza, prolungando così, probabilmente, la recessione economica. Durante il suo mandato i contribuenti, gli investitori e istituzioni semi statali hanno speso oltre 60 miliardi di euro per risolvere la crisi di 10 banche, secondo i calcoli del quotidiano “La Repubblica”.

Tuttavia, anche scaricare Visco così tardi comporta rischi. Il governo non si è preoccupato di vagliare seriamente candidature alternative, anche se ci sono diversi qualificati candidati italiani. Una nomina affrettata potrebbe non essere rigorosa. Inoltre, un nuovo governatore potrebbe essere considerato come il risultato di un mercanteggiamento politico, e indebolire così la reputazione della banca centrale. Ma se Visco restasse, correrebbe il rischio di essere il bersaglio di accuse quotidiane da parte di tutto l‘arco politico prima delle elezioni del 2018. Una commissione di inchiesta sul sistema bancario appena insediata potrebbe diventare teatro di altri attacchi politici, piuttosto che l‘opportunità di fare chiarezza sulle decisioni della banca centrale.

È vero che, oggi, il governatore potrebbe sembrare una figura meno importante dal momento che le funzioni di vigilanza più importanti sono state trasferite alla Banca Centrale Europea. Ma Banca d‘Italia rimane centrale per la gestione quotidiana delle operazioni bancarie italiane. Se Visco decidesse di lasciare, potrebbe disinnescare le tensioni politiche e contribuire a preservare l‘integrità della banca centrale. Sarebbe il risultato meno negativo.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen major companies in technology and other industries are planning to launch a coalition to demand legislation that would allow young, illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The Coalition for the American Dream intends to ask Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “Dreamers,” to continue working in the United States, the documents said.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows.

Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

“We’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,” Intel spokesman Will Moss said in a statement.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

Many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.

“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview earlier on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.

“You will see this continue to escalate until the end of the year,” he said.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.
In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.
Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.
Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.
That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan soldiers and police brought to the United States for training go “absent without leave” at far higher rates than those of any other country, potentially imperilling efforts to assist Afghan security forces, a U.S. watchdog said on Friday.

Of the 320 foreign military trainees who left while on courses in the United States from 2005 to 2017, 152 - or more than 47 percent - were Afghans, said a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).

The State Department called that number “unacceptably high”. SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.

In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.

That’s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.

“The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,” it concluded.

Only 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.

Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.

Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.

In response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend.

That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away. “If a student absconds, it affects his unit,” one Afghan officer told investigators.

Between 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Now, recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader Trump administration shows that with over 1,000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male.
Office of Personnel Management numbers analyzed by Reuters show that 88 percent of such appointees were non-Hispanic white and 62 percent were men.
In fact, this administration’s numbers are similar to those under the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush.
In 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump faced criticism from advocacy groups for not including more women and minorities in his cabinet last January, the incoming administration promised that the lower rungs of the bureaucracy would ultimately look more diverse.

Now, recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader Trump administration shows that with over 1,000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male.

Office of Personnel Management numbers analyzed by Reuters show that 88 percent of such appointees were non-Hispanic white and 62 percent were men.

By comparison, in the final year of Barack Obama's Democratic administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 67 percent of that group and men accounted for 47 percent - closer to what the U.S. population looks like. Non-Hispanic whites account for 61 percent and men make up 49 percent, according to 2016 census data. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xOf1ip)

“This administration so far has not in any direct sense prioritized diversity,” said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan group that tracks federal hiring, when presented with Reuters’ findings.

Out of the Trump administration’s 24 top cabinet-level positions, 17 are filled by white men.

Asked to comment on the mid-level personnel data, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump had a long history of promoting women and pointed to last week’s nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

“He will continue to elevate and empower women to top posts in his administration,” Walters said. She declined to discuss Trump’s views on the ethnicity of political appointees.

One day before Trump took office on Jan. 20, his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet’s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.

“People (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration,” he told reporters.

The mid-level political positions, known as “Schedule C” and “non-career SES” posts, numbered 1,051 in June, according to most recent data published in late September.

U.S. President Donald Trump is surrounded by his cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (L-R), Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Linda McMahon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tom Price, as he signs an executive order entitled "Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch" in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2017.

How many more of those jobs have been filled since and whether their demographics has changed will be known at the end of the year, when third quarter numbers are expected.

CRITICAL LINK

The positions include office managers, aides, policy experts and schedulers who are hired by top appointees, such as cabinet secretaries and their deputies. The mid-level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations.

In recent decades, such jobs would account for about half of some 4,000 positions that get filled anew with every change of administration. The OPM does not publish data on the more senior positions.

The personnel office has published data sorted by gender that goes back to 1998 and by ethnicity since 2006, allowing comparisons with only two past administrations.

Some political analysts say the profile of the new group of mid-level officials largely reflects a lower share of minorities among Republican voters and the fact that the Republican party has weaker ties to organizations that promote diversity and gender equality.

“It’s just a smaller set of folks who organize around those things and are connected to the Republican party,” said David Lewis, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential appointments.

In fact, this administration’s numbers are similar to those under the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush. Between 2006-2008, the only Bush years covered by OPM gender, race and ethnicity data, men made up 60 percent of mid-level staff and 88 percent described themselves as non-Hispanic white.

However, the United States has become more diverse over the past decade, making the numbers for this administration less representative of America’s demographic makeup than was the case under Bush.

In 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population. Now that share is 4 percentage points lower, U.S. Census figures show.

Among Republican registered voters, the share of those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white has edged down from 88 percent in 2008 to 86 percent just before the 2016 presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.

Women also have a larger share of overall U.S. jobs than during the Bush years. Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008. In 1998-2000, the final years of Bill Clinton’s presidency captured in the OPM data, that share averaged 51 percent.

The truck detonated next to a fuel tanker on Saturday, creating a huge fireball that incinerated multi-story buildings. Around half the dead were burned beyond recognition, said authorities.

The government conducted mass burials soon after the blast, in keeping with the Muslim practice of interring the dead as quickly as possible.

Religious leader Abdi Hayi said mourners had decided to conduct a symbolic funeral six days on, as it had not been possible to give so many of the victims a proper send-off with prayers at a mosque.

“Since we have not seen many bodies we came to conduct the funeral at the spot of the blast,” he said.

The bomb attack was the deadliest since Islamist militant group al Shabaab began an insurgency in 2007. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility, but the al Qaeda-linked organization has increasingly used truck bombs.

Somalia has been mired in conflict since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other. One of the poorest countries in Africa relies on foreign donors to support its institutions and basic services.

The battle-scarred coastal city is on edge after the bombing. A central road in the city emptied quickly after locals suspected a minivan loaded with vegetables was carrying a bomb. As police checked the van, shopkeepers and residents fled the scene.

“I closed my shop and ran away,” said shopkeeper Abdullahi Omar. “We have much fear and still the shock ... persisting in our minds.”

Israel has been the only major power to endorse statehood for the Kurds, partly, say analysts, because it sees the ethnic group - whose population is split among Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran - as a buffer against shared adversaries.

Iraqi armed forces retook the oil-rich Kirkuk region this week, following a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad, delivering a blow to the Kurds’ statehood quest.

Israeli officials said Netanyahu raised the Iraqi Kurds’ plight in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.

It has also come up in his contacts with France and the Israeli national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, has been discussing the matter with Trump administration officials in Washington this week, the officials said.

A Netanyahu government official, who declined to be named, given the sensitivity of Israel-Kurdish ties, suggested Israel had security interests in Kurdistan, given its proximity to Israel‘s enemies in Tehran and Damascus.

“This (territory) is a foothold. It’s a strategic place,” the official said without providing further detail. He said Israel wanted to see Iraqi Kurds provided with the means to protect themselves, adding:

“It would be best if someone gave them weaponry, and whatever else, which we cannot give, obviously.”

Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with Kurds since the 1960s, in the absence of open ties between their autonomous region in northern Iraq and Israel.

Netanyahu’s recent lobbying has focused on Kurdish ambitions in Iraq, where the central Baghdad government has grown closer to Israel’s foe Iran.

“The issue at present is ... to prevent an attack on the Kurds, extermination of the Kurds and any harm to them, their autonomy and region, something that Turkey and Iran and internal Shi‘ite and other powers in Iraq and part of the Iraqi government want,” Netanyahu’s intelligence minister, Israel Katz, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM on Friday.

It was not clear to what extent Netanyahu’s outreach may have been solicited by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, which shies away from public engagement with Israel, worried about further alienating Arab neighbours.

The United Nations has voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed.

“The prime minister is certainly engaging the United States, Russia, Germany and France to stop the Kurds from being harmed,” Katz said.

Another Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, framed Netanyahu’s efforts as a moral imperative.

“They (Kurds) are a deeply pro-Western people who deserve support,” he said.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
MORGANTOWN, West Virginia (Reuters) - A shortage of nurses at U.S. hospitals hit West Virginia’s Charleston Area Medical Center at the worst possible time.

The non-profit healthcare system is one of the state’s largest employers and sits in the heart of economically depressed coal country. It faces a $40 million deficit this year as it struggles with fewer privately insured patients, cuts in government reimbursement and higher labor costs to attract a shrinking pool of nurses.

To keep its operations intact, Charleston Medical is spending this year $12 million on visiting or “travel” nurses, twice as much as three years ago. It had no need for travel nurses a decade ago.

“I’ve been a nurse 40 years, and the shortage is the worst I’ve ever seen it,” said Ron Moore, who retired in October from his position as vice president and chief nursing officer for the center. Charleston Area Medical’s incentives include tuition reimbursement for nursing students who commit to work at the hospital for two years.

“It’s better to pay a traveler than to shut a bed,” he said.

Hospitals nationwide face tough choices when it comes to filling nursing jobs. They are paying billions of dollars collectively to recruit and retain nurses rather than risk patient safety or closing down departments, according to Reuters interviews with more than 20 hospitals, including some of the largest U.S. chains.

In addition to higher salaries, retention and signing bonuses, they now offer perks such as student loan repayment, free housing and career mentoring, and rely more on foreign or temporary nurses to fill the gaps.

The cost nationwide for travel nurses alone nearly doubled over three years to $4.8 billion in 2017, according to Staffing Industry Analysts, a global advisor on workforce issues.

The burden falls disproportionately on hospitals serving rural communities, many of them already straining under heavy debt like the Charleston Area Medical Center.

These hospitals must offer more money and benefits to compete with facilities in larger metropolitan areas, many of them linked to well-funded universities, interviews with hospital officials and health experts show.

Along West Virginia’s border with Pennsylvania, university-affiliated J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown is spending $10.4 million in 2017 compared with $3.6 million a year earlier to hire and retain nurses.

But these costs are part of the facility’s expansion this year, including adding more than 100 beds as it grows programs and takes over healthcare services from smaller rural providers that have scaled back or closed.

J.W. Ruby, the flagship hospital for WVU Medicine, offers higher pay for certain shifts, tuition reimbursement, $10,000 signing bonuses and free housing for staff who live at least 60 miles away.

Next year, the hospital is considering paying college tuition for the family members of long-time nurses to keep them in West Virginia.

“We’ll do whatever we need to do,” said Doug Mitchell, vice president and chief nursing officer of WVU Medicine-WVU Hospitals.

NOT LIKE OTHER SHORTAGES

Nursing shortages have occurred in the past, but the current crisis is far worse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there will be more than a million registered nurse openings by 2024, twice the rate seen in previous shortages.

A major driver is the aging of the baby boomer generation, with a greater number of patients seeking care, including many more complex cases, and a new wave of retirements among trained nurses.

Industry experts, from hospital associations to Wall Street analysts, say the crisis is harder to address than in the past. A faculty shortage and too few nursing school slots has contributed to the problem.

Hospitals seek to meet a goal calling for 80 percent of nursing staff to have a four-year degree by 2020, up from 50 percent in 2010. They also face more competition with clinics and insurance companies that may offer more flexible hours.

Healthcare experts warn that the shortfall presents risks to patients and providers. Research published in August in the International Journal of Nursing Studies found that having inadequate numbers of registered nurses on staff made it more likely that a patient would die after common surgeries.

UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, has invested millions to attract nurses, but still has 300 jobs to fill. At times, nursing vacancy rates in some of its departments has hit 20 percent or higher.

“We’ve rarely canceled a surgery or closed a bed because of lack of staffing,” said Terri Poe, chief of nursing at the hospital, the state’s largest, which serves many low income and uninsured residents.

Last year, the medical center covered nearly $200 million in unreimbursed medical costs for patients. It spent $4.5 million for visiting nurses during fiscal 2016, including $3 million for post-surgery services, compared with $858,000 in 2012.

Healthcare labor costs typically account for at least half of a facility’s expenses. They jumped by 7.6 percent nationally last year, after climbing at a rate closer to 5 percent annually in recent years, said Beth Wexler, vice president non-profit healthcare at Moody‘s. The spending has proven a boon for medical staffing companies like AMN Healthcare and Aya Healthcare.

Missouri’s nursing shortage reached a record high in 2017, with almost 16 percent - or 5,700 - of positions vacant, up from 8 percent last year. Thirty-four percent of Missouri registered nurses are 55 or older.

“Our biggest challenge is getting the pipeline of experienced nurses,” said Peter Callan, director of talent acquisition and development at the University of Missouri Health Care in Columbia, which is expanding. “There are fewer and fewer as people retire.”

Last year, the academic medical center hired talent scouts to identify candidates, Callan said. It spends $750,000 a year on extras to attract and keep nurses, including annual $2,000 bonuses to registered nurses who remain in hard-to-fill units and up to five years of student loan repayment assistance. It offers employee referral bonuses and a chance to win a trip to Hawaii.

Smaller hospitals find it much harder to compete in this climate. More than 40 percent of rural hospitals had negative operating margins in 2015, according to The Chartis Center for Rural Health.

In rural Missouri, 25-bed Ste. Genevieve County Memorial Hospital had to offer signing bonuses, tuition reimbursement and pay differentials when staffing is “critically low” in units such as obstetrics.

They haven’t closed beds, but have hired less experienced nurses, raised salaries and turned away at least one patient who would have been in its long term care program.

“We’ve had to try whatever it takes to get nurses here,” said Rita Brumfield, head of nursing at the hospital. “It’s a struggle every day to get qualified staff.”

Besides, if the alternative to these markets is the impassive, incompetent bureaucratic state, then the policy path is obvious. Let markets go free and peg back governments, so their only role in the productive economy is to deal with the occasional failure of markets to work as they should.

This story of private sector freedom and state sector sloth is often told. In the United States, profit-hungry entrepreneurs are considered economic heroes. Even in more social democratic Europe, few politicians or commentators publicly doubt that the profit motive is almost always the best way to get things done.

As with all good myths, there is a thin tie to reality. The Soviet Union showed that economies stagnate without private enterprise. However, communist Russia is long gone. The pairing of good free markets and bad governments should be evaluated by the standard of what is actually happening. By that measure, the story makes no sense, for four reasons.

First, markets and governments are not enemies. Markets are created and sustained by law and they thrive in well-governed societies. Complex modern economies cannot thrive without extensive regulation, and only governments can ensure that rules actually serve the common good.

Second, free markets sometimes subvert that common good. Take the pharmaceutical industry. It certainly produces many useful products, but the search for ever higher profits has led too many companies to focus on drugs which patients have to take for many years, rather than on antibiotics, which cure quickly and usually cheaply. In the United States, the industry’s blind dedication to profits has contributed to the wild over-prescription of opioid painkillers, helping to spawn a public health crisis.

Third, the private-public split is too simple. Many important institutions are neither one nor the other. In healthcare, education, scientific research and public infrastructure, much of the work may ultimately be under government control, but the leading organisations are mostly self-perpetuating and self-governing bodies. Mostly they serve the common good fairly well.

Finally, not-for-profit organisations have advantages over market players. Taxpayers and donors can fund projects which are too risky for private investors. Organisations with a public responsibility can work on socially useful projects which will never generate a big cash profit. These attributes give the government a much wider remit than just resolving market failures.

The free market myth will not go away on its own. It needs to be replaced. One potential substitute, the old narrative of the social market or social democracy, has lost its appeal. Perhaps voters should be grateful that the mixed economy has given them the highest level of prosperity and economic security ever seen. They are not thankful. On the contrary, they are increasingly tempted by populist narratives which condemn, among other things, stultifying government bureaucracy.

It is true that many government agencies have lost their way. All institutions tend to become rigid over time, but governments have an additional problem with morale. It’s hard to be imaginative and energetic when you’re frequently told that your only job is to pick up the messes left by the generally much more competent private sector.

The free-market answer to all problems is to shrink the government, but that would only make everything worse. The modern economy is a shared project which cannot work well without a vibrant non-private sector. If that sector is tired and beaten down, it needs to be encouraged and revived. University College London (UCL), itself a pretty vibrant non-private institution, has launched a project with exactly that goal. The Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose is run by economist Mariana Mazzucato. Her book “The Entrepreneurial State”, a defence of the contributions and potential of government in the modern economy, inspires the IIPP’s motto: entrepreneurial societies need entrepreneurial states.

Mazzucato has gathered an impressive selection of big names in the non-private economy on the IIPP’s advisory board, from James Galbraith, who teaches about the economic role of government at the University of Texas, to Mike Bracken, who led the successful effort to create user-friendly websites for the British government.

But the names on the board – and the chat at last week’s launch party in London – also show how much work remains to be done. Almost all the people listening enthusiastically to the narrative of the central role of the non-private sector were already well ensconced in that part of the economy.

To get past preaching to the converted, the new story has to persuade politicians. There are few signs of that happening. The private sector is even less interested. Shareholder value is still the norm and government is still generally treated as either an enemy or a tool to be manipulated in the fight for competitive advantage. Old myths are hard to kill.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - The leader of a Pakistani militant group whose suicide bombings killed more than 250 people died on Thursday of injuries from a U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan, a spokesman for the militants said.

Omar Khalid Khorasani’s death comes ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit and is likely to help ease tensions between the often-wary allies, as Islamabad has been asking Washington to target militants who attack inside Pakistan and hide over the border in Afghanistan.

Khorasani’s Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, is one of dozens of armed Islamist factions - including al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban - operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

But JuA has been particularly deadly in Pakistan, claiming responsibility for eight major attacks in two years.

Among them was last year’s Easter Sunday bombing in a park that killed at least 70 people, including 29 children, in the eastern city of Lahore.

The group also said it carried out a suicide attack at a hospital that killed at least 74 people in the southwestern city of Quetta, a bombing also claimed by Islamic State, with which JuA also has been affiliated.

Rumours had flown for two days that Khorasani had been wounded in U.S. drone strikes along the Afghan-Pakistani border, and on Thursday his group confirmed he had died.

“Our leader, Omar Khalid Khorasani, was wounded in one of the recent drone strikes in Afghanistan. He was wounded badly, and today he was martyred,” JuA spokesman Asad Mansur said by telephone.

The announcement came a week after Pakistan’s army rescued a kidnapped American couple and their three children from the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban faction that Washington has long accused Islamabad of failing to target.

The killing of Khorasani is likely to add to the recently improved mood between Washington and Islamabad, said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and prominent political analyst.

“He was a very powerful leader and he had done great harm to Pakistan,” Masood said of Khorasani. “I think Pakistan has been looking forward to this, and I think the Americans targeting him has been very helpful in that sense.”

Khorasani had a background that reads like a history of Pakistani militancy.

Born Abdul Wali in a village called Lakaro in the northwestern Mohmand tribal region, Khorasani started out as an anti-India jihadist fighting in Kashmir, according to a long-time friend who spoke last year to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

He later joined the Pakistani Taliban in 2007 to fight the government to establish strict sharia Islamic law.

In 2014, Khorasani left the Pakistani Taliban after a leadership quarrel to form Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.

JuA gained attention in September 2014 when it announced it was supporting Islamic State and rejecting the main Pakistani Taliban leadership.

By March 2015, however, the group was again swearing loyalty to the main Pakistani Taliban umbrella leadership.

Still, JuA never specifically disavowed Islamic State either, and several attacks inside Pakistan have been claimed by both groups.

The United States last year designated JuA as a terrorist group.

Khorasani had previously been seriously wounded in a NATO air strike in eastern Afghanistan in 2015 but later recovered.

World number two Muguruza swatted aside the 37-year-old 7-5 6-0 in July to claim her second grand slam title and next week’s showdown will be the highlight of the White Group, which also includes Czech Karolina Pliskova and French Open holder Jelena Ostapenko.

The power-packed pool, full of aggressive players armed with big serves, will open proceedings on Sunday when Pliskova faces 2008 WTA Finals champion Williams, before Muguruza takes on Latvia’s Ostapenko at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

“Maybe I need to channel some of those memories (from 2008) to play well here... we have an amazing field, the tournament is the best it has ever been run and the excitement level is high,” Williams said at the glitzy pre-tournament gala ceremony.

World number one Simona Halep was drawn in the Red Group alongside Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina, Denmark’s Caroline Wozniacki and in-form Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia, with play in that pool starting on Monday.

Halep will also have revenge in mind when she faces Garcia for the second time in three weeks after the Frenchwoman beat her in the China Open final in Beijing, a day after the Romanian became the 25th woman to climb to the top of the WTA rankings.

The elite event offers a healthy haul of points throughout the eight days of action and remarkably, seven players in the field, all excluding Garcia, have a chance to claim the prestigious season-ending number one ranking.

The round-robin format will see the top two players from each pool advance to the semi-finals.

REUTERS - All over the world, parents are trying to wean their kids away from the internet. They are reducing screen time, blocking Facebook and restricting access. But in Advait Chandan’s “Secret Superstar”, the problem is the solution.

Handout photo from the film “Secret Superstar”.

The internet offers heroine Insiya an escape route from a stifling life. The shadow of an abusive father and the domestic violence she sees every day loom over her. What keeps her going is her love for music - and her mother Najma. For all her submissive behaviour in front of her husband, Najma is a feisty woman - she fights for her daughter to have the freedom she herself never had. She lets Insiya go out with boys, pursue her music, and buys her a laptop with an internet connection.

Insiya might live in Vadodara, not one of India’s biggest cities, but the internet is a great leveller. She records a few videos on YouTube wearing a burqa - fearing her father will find out - and in the magical ways of Bollywood, turns into an internet sensation overnight. She has millions of page views, fan pages waiting for her posts, but at home, none of that matters because her father can wreak havoc at any time.

To his credit, director Chandan doesn’t shy away from depicting domestic violence. There are scenes that are difficult to watch and the reality of domestic abuse and its effects on children are portrayed with more sensitivity and realism than usual for a Bollywood film. The bond between Najma and Insiya is also one of the film’s highlights, as is the track between Insiya and Chintan (Tirth Sharma), her classmate who harbours a very obvious crush on her.

The problem with “Secret Superstar” is that it starts out with a good idea, but the film unravels because it wants to say too many things at once. Chandan seems determined that audiences should cry at every turn. Insiya and her journey to stardom are full of contrivances. Chandan isn’t bothered about authenticity or logic - he just wants to make sure those tears are flowing.

Aamir Khan appears as Shakti Kumarr, the rather obnoxious and self-obsessed music director who turns into an unlikely saviour for Insiya, but this film is not about him. It is about Insiya, and Zaira Wasim puts in an inspired performance that rides over the several bumps in the script. She shares a wonderful chemistry with Meher Vij, who plays Najma, and the two of them are the life of “Secret Superstar”. If only the film had shown as much restraint as they do, it might have been more deserving of “superstar” status.

'Anemic' iPhone 8 demand drags Apple shares lower

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.
Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.
“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November.
When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.
But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s shares fell nearly 3 percent on Thursday on signs of weak demand for the iPhone 8 that caused analysts and investors to question the company’s staggered release strategy for its latest phones.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) sank deeper into crisis on Friday as the embattled company said it had lost some customers to competitors because of widespread data falsification that had extended to its mainstream steel sheet business.

Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, which supplies the world’s top airline and automobile manufacturers, also said it had violated statutory standards set by the industry ministry, pushing the scandal beyond failure to meet specifications agreed with customers.

Until now, the 112-year-old company had said products it sold with falsified data met safety and other standards but did not meet contract specifications agreed with customers. It had also said the problem was mainly with aluminium and copper products.

Kobe Steel has an extensive role in global supply chains - the company produces engine valve springs found in half the world’s cars, according to its website.

Kobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara said the company had found a breach of industrial standards at its Hatano copper plant southwest of Tokyo, along with a new case of falsification of data at a unit that cuts and processes steel plate.

”There has been also some impact on our business as we have lost credibility,” Umehara told a news conference, citing cases that the company lost orders and customers switched to its competitors. “But we can’t quantify the impact at the moment.”

He said the Hatano plant did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards for quality management after it faked data on tensile strength and other properties of copper and copper-alloy piping.

Kobe Steel has stopped shipping about 43 percent of copper products from the plant over the problems with the statutory standards, a company spokeswoman said.

Two certification companies said on Thursday they were investigating whether the plant is in line with a global standard on quality control.

They could suspend or cancel the “ISO9001” certification of the plant if it doesn’t meet the standard, which could affect its business as many global buyers require suppliers to use the benchmark.

Kobe Steel said it also found, as the result of a whistleblower, that a plant in western Japan had been ”obstructing company’s voluntary inspection” by concealing data.

After getting a tip that workers at the Chofu plant failed to report data falsification on aluminium extrusion products, the company decided to set up a panel of outsiders, replacing an in-house panel led by the company’s president.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry believes “the data concealment by its employees has hurt the credibility of Kobe Steel’s voluntary investigation,” said Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division.

The ministry ordered the company on Friday to expedite its probes and report results as soon as possible.

Kobe Steel previously said that it found widespread falsification of data on the strength and durability of copper and aluminium products sent to customers. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.

JUSTICE PROBE

Slideshow (6 Images)

Global automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products because of the falsification, although four Japanese carmakers said on Thursday they have found no safety issues with aluminium parts supplied by Kobe Steel.

The company is now subject to a U.S. Justice Department probe while checks continue at hundreds of its clients involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. But in Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.

“We are worried about the U.S. Justice Department probe,” said a source at one of the company’s lenders. “The impact will be very big if the DOJ seeks a criminal case against Kobe and hits it with huge financial penalties.”

The company has started selling assets to raise fund, on Friday holding the first round of an auction to sell its most of a property unit, sources told Reuters on Friday, a deal that reportedly could raise over $400 million.

Kobe Steel’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out.

Kobe Steel shares fell 1.6 percent on Friday. They have fallen nearly 40 percent since it revealed the problems on Oct. 8, wiping about $1.60 billion off its market value.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A week after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a blistering speech about Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military and economic force in the Islamic Republic has shown it has no intention of curbing its activities in the Middle East.

In defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran’s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region.

A senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was “acting crazy” and was following U.S. strategy of increasing “the shadow of war in the region”.

Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

“In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.

“The IRGC can’t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don’t back down.”

The day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards’ al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq’s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum.

The niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month.

Other Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.

“I don’t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,” she said. “He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.”

LIGHTNING ASSAULT

Within days, Iran’s mostly Shi‘ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran’s hand in Iraq.

Commanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi‘ite-led Iraqi central government’s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied.

A video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi‘ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office.

Iran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism.

After the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran.

FRONT-LINE PLAYER

Regional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi‘ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,” said Khamenei. “Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.”

Speaking after Trump’s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: ”From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...

“Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.”

The ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months.

Small boats from the Revolutionary Guards’ navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares.

In August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official.

Some recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually.

During the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.

POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT

The Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi‘ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.

“The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi‘ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards.

In early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.

“This is the first time that we’ve seen it used in this area,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack.

Dozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military.

Asked about the threat posed by Shi‘ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump’s speech, Dillon said: “We’re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.”

Trump’s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards’ political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet.

Since becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards’ economic influence and involvement in political matters.

Now, Rouhani’s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump’s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. “What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,” said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - European football’s governing body (UEFA) has opened disciplinary proceedings against Everton after one of the club’s fans tried to punch an Olympique Lyon player in a melee that broke out during Thursday’s Europa League game at Goodison Park.
“Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA Europa League group stage match between Everton FC and Olympique Lyonnais (1-2), played on 19 October in England,” UEFA said in a statement on Friday.
The governing body added that the English club had been charged with “Aggressions by supporters against players” under Article 16 (2) (H) of its disciplinary regulations.
“I understand his situation yesterday,” the manager told a press conference ahead of Sunday’s Premier League home game against Arsenal.
”He was a captain on the pitch and of course in the situation of the brawl he needs to control himself.

Merseyside Police are also investigating the brawl on the pitch between players from both teams, while Everton have banned one individual.

“Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA Europa League group stage match between Everton FC and Olympique Lyonnais (1-2), played on 19 October in England,” UEFA said in a statement on Friday.

The governing body added that the English club had been charged with “Aggressions by supporters against players” under Article 16 (2) (H) of its disciplinary regulations.

Everton captain Ashley Williams sparked off the trouble in the 64th minute when he shoved Anthony Lopes into the advertising hoardings after the Lyon goalkeeper had collected the ball from a corner.

An all-out melee ensued with players from both sides getting involved, while at least one fan behind the goal was caught on video throwing punches at a Lyon player before stewards intervened.

Everton issued a statement saying they had banned an individual from future matches after reviewing footage of the incident and would be making a formal complaint to Merseyside Police.

The force said its detectives would review footage and speak to witnesses to establish what, if any, offences had been committed.

WALES FRUSTRATION AFFECTING WILLIAMS

Everton manager Ronald Koeman said on Friday that Williams had acted out of frustration born partly from Wales’s failure to qualify for the World Cup and needed to control his emotions better.

“I understand his situation yesterday,” the manager told a press conference ahead of Sunday’s Premier League home game against Arsenal.

”His personal situation, it was difficult after (being knocked) out of the World (Cup following the qualifiers) with Wales. He had some mistakes that cost a goal but I like that mentality.

“From frustration you get maybe more aggression and that’s not bad. But you need to control yourself.”

The defender, who scored an equaliser for Everton minutes after the incident, and Lyon striker Bertrand Traore, who got the winner for his side, received yellow cards for their parts in the struggle.

Koeman also praised his skipper for his leadership on the pitch.

”He showed his face yesterday, he played well,“ he added. ”He was a captain on the pitch and of course in the situation of the brawl he needs to control himself.

“But okay, on one side I understand frustration, disappointment, because everybody was disappointed.”

The loss increases scrutiny of Koeman, whose team sit bottom of their group with no wins in three Europa League games and on a two-game winless streak in the Premier League, where they are 16th in the standings.

Gilbert Rozon made the announcement on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. He is the latest entertainment executive to be accused of sexual harassment in the wake of accusations against U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“Shaken by the allegations against me, I wish to take time to reflect,” Rozon wrote, adding he was “sincerely sorry” for “all the women and men I may have offended in the course of my life.”

The company confirmed Rozon’s resignation and said an independent board of directors will be put in place. Spokesman Jean-David Pelletier declined to comment further.

Montreal newspaper ‘Le Devoir’ on Thursday reported allegations by nine women who said they had been sexually harassed or abused by Rozon.

Rozon announced his immediate resignation from ‘Just for Laughs’, as well as his departure from the committee organizing events to mark Montreal’s 375th anniversary this year and his role as vice president of the Montreal Board of Trade.

Held every summer in Montreal, ‘Just for Laughs’ is one of the largest international comedy festivals and is a major tourist attraction for the city.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made gender equality a significant part of the government’s focus, said society was “seeing a moment of awakening”.

“It’s unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets and I think people are beginning to get it,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal. “It doesn’t matter how much power you have, how much influence you have, it’s never all right.”

Amazon Studios chief Roy Price also resigned earlier this week following allegations he harassed a producer and took no action when an actress told him she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein.

Stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) overall attracted $5.4 billion in the week ended Oct. 18, while emerging markets pulled in $2.3 billion, the most cash since March, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper research unit.

For equity ETFs, the SPDR S&P 500 and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets contributed the two largest net positive flows, attracting more than $4.6 billion and $1.4 billion in new cash respectively, Lipper said.

Invesco Ltd Global Market Strategist Kristina Hooper said economic growth was not enough to explain the stock gains. The S&P 500 has delivered more than a 16 percent return this year, including dividends, and some 350 percent since its March 2009 lows, yet U.S. gross domestic product growth has been averaging around 2 percent annually.

“This is not explosive growth, and yet we have a stock market that’s moving higher largely based on expectations of what’s going to happen,” said Hooper.

U.S. President Donald Trump is looking to overhaul the country’s corporate tax system, a move that would be seen as a positive for stocks.

“I‘m concerned in the U.S. that there’s greater vulnerability because stocks have been on a tear and a lot of it has been based on sentiment as opposed to fundamentals,” said Hooper.

Stocks have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

Paul Kim, director of ETF strategy at Principal Financial Group Inc, said companies were using keen maneuvers to boost profits even when sales growth was minimal. Companies were reducing their outstanding shares using buybacks, he said, pushing up profits as a percentage of a declining number of shares.

Domestic-focused stock funds pulled in $1 billion during the week, the most since August. Non-domestic equity funds attracted $4.3 billion, marking a fifth straight week of inflows.

Swings between sectors continue to generate a powerful undertow in otherwise tranquil markets. Healthcare and biotechnology sector funds posted $382 billion in outflows during the week, marking the category’s largest withdrawals since August, according to Lipper.

A bipartisan deal to stabilize Obamacare by restoring federal subsidies to health insurers picked up Republican support in the Senate on Thursday, despite Trump’s opposition, but still faces an uphill battle.

And the bullish mood on stocks did little to shake demand for bonds. Taxable-bond funds took in $4 billion for the week, according to Lipper, and the category has posted outflows just three weeks this year. Low risk money-market funds took in $5.1 billion.

But Treasury funds posted $391 million outflows, the most withdrawn since July, and high-yield outflows of $450 million marked the largest withdrawals since August, Lipper said.

Die Republikaner stellten in der von ihnen kontrollierten Kongresskammer in der Nacht zum Freitag die Weichen für eine vereinfachte Abstimmung über eines der zentralen Prestigevorhaben Trumps. Sie nahmen einen Haushaltsentwurf an, der neben einer billionenschweren Extra-Belastung des Staatsetats ein Instrument beinhaltet, das es ihnen ermöglichen würde, auch ohne Unterstützung der oppositionellen Demokraten die Steuerpläne durch die Kammer zu bringen. Trump sprach auf Twitter vom “ersten Schritt” hin zu “massiven Steuererleichterungen für das amerikanische Volk”. Die Finanzmärkte reagierten positiv. Sowohl in Asien als auch in Europa verbuchten die Börsen Gewinne. Scharfe Kritik kam dagegen von der Opposition.

Der Senat stimmte mit 51 zu 49 dafür, grünes Licht für eine zusätzliche Belastung des Bundeshaushalts um bis zu 1,5 Billionen Dollar binnen zehn Jahren zu geben. So sollen die von der Regierung versprochenen Steuersenkungen für Unternehmen und Privatpersonen im Volumen von bis zu sechs Billionen Dollar mitfinanziert werden können. Der Entwurf sieht außerdem eine Art Schlichtungsverfahren vor, das die Chancen erhöhen würde, Trumps Steuerreform durch den Senat zu bekommen. Denn bei der Abstimmung über die Steuergesetzgebung würde dann bereits eine einfach Mehrheit reichen. Normalerweise wären dafür mindestens 60 der 100 Stimmen im Senat nötig. Die Republikaner verfügen aber nur über 52 Stimmen - und bei Demokraten stoßen die Steuerpläne in ihrer jetzigen Form auf wenig Gegenliebe. Nach ihrer Auffassung profitieren in erster Linie Konzerne und Superreiche von den Erleichterungen. Für Teile der Mittelschicht würden die Steuern sogar steigen, und das Staatsdefizit würde ebenfalls höher ausfallen, sagte Senator Ron Wyden, der Spitzenvertreter der Demokraten im Finanzausschuss der Kammer.

TRUMP NACH OBAMACARE-DEBAKEL UNTER ERFOLGSDRUCK

Bevor allerdings überhaupt über eine komplette Steuerreform abgestimmt werden kann, muss der Entwurf des Senats mit dem bereits verabschiedeten Gegenstück der anderen Kongresskammer, dem Repräsentantenhaus, in Einklang gebracht werden. Dessen Version fällt in mehreren Punkten anders aus. So streben die Abgeordneten ein Nullsummen-Spiel an, bei dem der Haushalt nicht zusätzlich belastet würde. Steuersenkungen sollen begleitet werden von erheblichen Ausgabekürzungen im sozialen Bereich, etwa bei der Hilfe für Arme.

Trump und seine Partei stehen erheblich unter Druck, endlich eines der zentralen Wahlversprechen von 2016 umzusetzen, nachdem sie mit dem Versuch, die Gesundheitsreform von Trumps Vorgänger Barack Obama zu kippen, gescheitert sind. Der Präsident feierte denn auch das Abstimmungsergebnis im Senat als “großartige News”. Der Mehrheitsführer der Republikaner im Senat, Mitch McConnell, sagte, mit diesem Etat-Entwurf sei man auf dem Weg, Familien und Einzelpersonen zu entlasten. Der parteipolitisch unabhängige Senator Bernie Sanders, der sich im vergangenen Jahr um die Präsidentschaftskandidatur der Demokraten beworben hatte, sagte dagegen, der Haushaltsentwurf sei erschreckend. In Zeiten, in denen die Einkommen massiv ungleich verteilt seien, liefere dieser Haushalt 1,9 Billionen Dollar Steuererleichterungen für das reichste Prozent der Bevölkerung.

An den Börsen ließ die Bewegung bei dem Steuervorhaben Hoffnungen auf einen US-Wirtschaftsboom aufflammen. Analyst Neil Wilson vom Brokerhaus ETX Capital sprach von einem großen Schritt in Richtung Steuersenkungen. Dax und EuroStoxx stiegen bis Freitagmittag in der Spitze um jeweils etwa ein halbes Prozent auf 13.063 und 3617 Punkte.

“Les 100 premiers contributeurs à l‘ISF paient 126 millions d‘euros, les 100 premiers patrimoines paient 73 millions d‘euros d‘ISF”, a déclaré le ministre de l‘Economie et des Finances pendant le débat sur le projet de loi de finances (PLF) 2018 à l‘Assemblée nationale.

Pour Bruno Le Maire, ces chiffres - réclamés par de nombreux parlementaires, majoritairement de gauche, via une tribune publiée mercredi dans Libération - confortent les choix du gouvernement.

La différence entre les 126 millions d‘euros d‘ISF dont s‘acquittent les 100 premiers contributeurs et les 73 millions payés par les plus gros patrimoines prouve “que l‘ISF est non seulement inefficace mais qu‘il est injuste, parce que les plus gros patrimoines français ne paient pas l‘ISF et arrivent par optimisation fiscale à y échapper”, a-t-il expliqué.

Bruno Le Maire, qui a déjà annoncé mercredi dans l‘hémicycle que les 1.000 premiers contributeurs à l‘ISF payaient 406 millions d‘euros, a déclaré qu‘il n‘était pas en mesure de préciser le montant que ces contributeurs continueraient à régler au titre du nouvel impôt sur la fortune immobilière (IFI).

“Sur ce point-là, je ne peux pas vous donner plus de précisions pour des raisons qui sont simples: la valeur du prochain IFI est calculée sur la valeur nette des biens, et il est impossible de savoir quel est le niveau d‘endettement de chaque contribuable”, a-t-il déclaré.

L‘opposition a jugé que ces précisions ne répondaient que partiellement à sa demande d‘explications, faute d‘éléments concernant l‘impact du prélèvement forfaitaire unique (PFU) - également appelé “flat tax” - sur les revenus du capital.

CONTRE-ATTAQUE

La mise en place de cette autre mesure phare du projet de budget pour 2018 également contestée par l‘opposition a été adoptée dans la nuit de jeudi à vendredi.

”On demandait deux choses : on demandait l‘ISF et le coût de la ‘flat tax’“ pour les ménages les plus riches”, a déclaré sur BFMTV la députée Nouvelle gauche (ex-PS) Valérie Rabault, signataire de l‘appel publié dans Libération, rapporteure du budget lors de la précédente législature.

“Moi je veux avoir le bilan global”, a-t-elle poursuvi.

Selon les chiffres communiqués par Bruno Le Maire, avec la suppression de l‘ISF, “ça fait à peu près 1,3 million d‘euros en moyenne de chèque qui va être restitué (par contributeur à l‘ISF) et là-dessus va se greffer la ‘flat tax’, pour laquelle on n‘a toujours pas de données” et qui “représente une grande économie d‘impôt”, a dit Valérie Rabault.

Réaffirmant sa volonté de “transparence”, Bruno Le Maire, qui avait déjà invoqué le secret fiscal mercredi, a mis en avant une attitude “responsable” qui s‘inscrit dans le cadre légal, en attaquant l‘héritage fiscal du précédent quinquennat.

“Sans doute que la précédente majorité aurait peut-être fait mieux d‘être elle aussi responsable et de faire attention à ce qui était légal et à ce qui ne l‘était pas, ça lui aurait peut-être évité de mettre en place une taxe sur les dividendes à 3% que nous devons désormais rembourser parce qu‘elle a été annulée par le Conseil constitutionnel”, a lancé le ministre.

La taxe à 3% sur les dividendes mise en place fin 2012 a été invalidée au début du mois par le Conseil constitutionnel et le coût des contentieux engagés par les grands groupes concernés devrait s‘élever à près de dix milliards d‘euros.

Le remplacement de l‘ISF par l‘IFI, une des mesures phares du PLF pour 2018, a cristallisé les critiques de l‘opposition de gauche - qui dénonce un “budget pour les riches” - et suscité des réserves au sein même de la majorité présidentielle.

Face aux critiques croissantes, le gouvernement a accéléré le tempo et a avancé la discussion par les députés des articles concernant la suppression de l‘ISF et la mise en place d‘un autre dispositif contesté, le prélèvement forfaitaire unique (PFU), qui auraient normalement dû être examinés plus tard dans la discussion.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga, who says he will boycott a presidential election re-run due next week, said on Friday he would announce a “way forward” the day before the scheduled poll, raising the possibility he might participate after all.

At a memorial in western Kenya for opposition supporters killed in protests against the vote set for Oct. 26, Odinga told his supporters not to attack “innocent people” including people who support his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta.

He did not comment on an announcement by the electoral board chief executive Ezra Chiloba earlier on Friday that he would take three weeks’ leave.

Kenya is holding the re-run after the Supreme Court threw out the result of an Aug. 8 election won by the incumbent Kenyatta but disputed by the challenger Odinga. The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud.

The opposition has demanded Chiloba resign, and the announcement that he will not participate in running the vote suggests progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations involving Western diplomats and religious and civil society leaders.

Uncertainty over whether Odinga will participate in the election and concerns that it may not proceed peacefully have left Kenya, a traditionally stable Western ally in an often chaotic region, mired in political crisis.

The volatile build-up to the Oct. 26 vote has revived memories for Kenyans of ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a disputed election in 2007, when Odinga also lost and disputed the result.

Chiloba told Reuters that, in light of the opposition’s demands, he was going on leave, and that all arrangements for next week’s vote were in place.

At least 45 people died nationwide in a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the August vote, including a six-month old baby struck on the head by a police baton.

With Odinga yet to respond to Chiloba’s decision to go on leave, diplomats said they were unsure what would happen next.

“The crystal ball is very cloudy at the moment,” a senior western diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters. “The situation is changing by the hour.”

REVIEW OF BOYCOTT?

Slideshow (7 Images)

The electoral board has said next week’s election will go ahead. Odinga met its chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday and later told reporters that if there were serious consultations and serious reforms, the opposition could review its boycott.

Chebukati had said a day earlier that he could not guarantee the election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against colleagues. A fellow board member resigned this week after fleeing to the United States, saying she feared for her life.

The opposition has held near-daily protests demanding electoral reforms and the sacking of board officials. Police said on Friday four people were killed as a result of their interventions to stop demonstrations.

Kenyatta has meanwhile urged Kenyans to come out in large numbers to vote, insisting the ballot be held. On Thursday, he snubbed an invitation to meet Chebukati, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning.

In a speech in Nairobi on Friday, Kenyatta said the election must not divide the nation or push it to the brink.

Disruptions of the vote by “those who thrive in chaos and relish anarchy” would not be tolerated, and security forces “have been enhanced and appropriately deployed to maintain law and order”, he said.

MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government has secured opposition support for dissolving Catalonia’s parliament and holding new elections there in January in its bid to defuse the regional government’s push for independence.

The Socialists, the main opposition, said on Friday they would back special measures to impose central rule on the region to thwart the secessionist-minded Catalan government and end a crisis that has unsettled the euro and hurt confidence in the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who wants opposition support to be able to present a united front in the crisis, has called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to pave the way for Madrid establishing central control in the region.

The government on Friday would not confirm whether January elections formed a part of the package, with Rajoy saying only that the measures would be announced on Saturday.

However a government spokesman saw regional elections as likely. “The logical end to this process would be new elections established within the law,” said government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo at a weekly government press conference.

It will be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that Madrid has invoked the constitution to effectively sack a regional government and call new elections.

Rajoy wants as broad a consensus as possible before taking the step, which has raised the prospect of more large-scale protests in Catalonia, where pro-independence groups have been able to bring more than one million people out onto the streets.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, a former journalist who is spearheading the secession campaign, has refused to renounce independence, citing an overwhelming vote in favor of secession at a referendum on Oct.1.

Catalan authorities said around 90 percent voted for independence though only 43 percent of voters participated. Opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE HURT

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum unconstitutional, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The prolonged standoff has caused hundreds of companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia and prompted the Spanish government to cut its economic growth forecast. The region accounts for a fifth of Spain’s economy.

Later on Friday, Moody’s was scheduled to review Spain’s sovereign rating, days after warning that political tensions between Madrid and the rebel leadership in Catalonia were credit-negative for the sovereign.

In a test of investor appetite for Spanish stocks, housebuilder Aedas (AEDAS.MC) dropped over 6 percent in its debut on the Madrid stock exchange on Friday, although it later regained losses to trade close to its listing price.

The uncertainty surrounding the future of the region has rattled the euro. On Thursday, European Union leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron offered their support for Rajoy at an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The EU says it will not act as a mediator and the crisis is for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

After Rajoy announces the direct control measures on Saturday, Spain’s upper house will have to approve them in a session which could take place on Oct. 27, a Senate spokeswoman said on Friday.

Actions could range from dismissing the Catalan parliament and government, to a softer approach of removing specific heads of department. Direct rule from Madrid would be temporary while regional elections are held to form a new government.

Madrid on Friday stressed the move was not about taking autonomy away from Catalonia but temporarily imposing direct rule until a government was elected that would act within the law.

Socialist politician Carmen Calvo, a member of cross-party talks to establish what measures the government should take to impose direct rule on Catalonia, told TVE state television that January regional elections would form part of the package.

She gave no further details apart from saying the Socialists wanted a light-touch intervention.

The Avexis robot takes its first plunge into a nuclear waste silo at the Sellafield plant in northern England. Small and nimble enough to squeeze into places human can't... it's helping survey a storage silo and clear away small bits of waste clinging to the silo wall, part of Sellafield's decommissioning process. Avexis was co-developed by a team from the University of Manchester. It's equipped with cameras and sensors, including gamma and neutron detectors. SOUNDBITE (English) DR. SIMON WATSON, LECTURER IN ROBOTIC SYSTEMS AT UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER, SAYING: "This vehicle here is Avexis, which is the Aqua Vehicle Explorer for In-Situ Sensing, and it's been designed to characterise and explore nuclear storage facilities or nuclear disaster areas. So the two areas that we're primarily focused on are the legacy ponds at the Sellafield site in the UK and the Fukushima site in Japan." In July, these lava-like lumps were spotted inside a damaged reactor at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant. It suggests there may be nuclear fuel inside, but accurately locating it has proved tricky. Earlier this month, Avexis was successfully tested in Japan close to Fukushima. The developers hope it will offer a cost-effective way of pinpointing fuel in the reactor so it can be safely removed. SOUNDBITE (English) DR. SIMON WATSON, LECTURER IN ROBOTIC SYSTEMS AT UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER, SAYING: "If it only lasts for two hours but it costs significantly less than a big expensive one then we could put several of these in over a period of time to get the data out that we need." At about 13,000 dollars, the makers say Avixis is the cheapest of its kind. Further tests are ongoing, ahead of eventual deployment into Fukushima's damaged nuclear core.

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the people of the majority Arab city and surrounding province would decide their own future “within the framework of a decentralized, federal, democratic Syria”.

In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa’s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the SDF pledged “to protect the frontiers of the province against all external threats”, and to hand control to a civil council from the city.

The U.S.-backed SDF, which is led by Kurdish militia fighters and also includes Arabs, captured the Syrian de-facto capital of Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate this week in a decisive defeat for the group that had ruled over millions of people from central Syria to northern Iraq.

In Syria, the fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers.

Kurdish-led authorities in other parts of the north say they want a federal system that would allow regions to rule themselves without central control by the center. They have been moving ahead with plans set it up, despite discouragement from their U.S. allies and strong opposition from both Turkey and the Syrian government in Damascus.

Turkey views the rise of Kurdish power in Syria as a threat to its national security, viewing Kurdish groups in northern Syria as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is fighting a three-decade insurgency in Turkey.

Turkey said on Friday that a huge banner of jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in central Raqqa by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces was proof that Washington had been working with terrorists.

NO PROGRESS TOWARDS PEACE

The Kurdish-led autonomy plans in Syria have advanced as diplomacy has failed to make any progress towards a political solution to the six-year-long war.

Assad, who is fast regaining territory in Syria’s most populous eastern regions with Iranian and Russian military support, has repeatedly said the state will recover all Syria.

Asked about the SDF statement, Ali Haidar, the Syrian government minister responsible for national reconciliation, said Raqqa’s future could only be discussed “as part of the final political structure of the Syrian state”.

The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, has established control over swathes of northern Syria in operations backed by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, mostly avoiding conflict with Russian-backed pro-government forces.

Spokesman Talal Silo reaffirmed the SDF’s plan to hand control of Raqqa to a civil council formed of people from the city, and to hand over internal security to a police force drawn from local recruits.

He called Raqqa’s liberation “the final chapter” of a struggle that began against Islamic State from the town of Kobani some three years ago, though the SDF is still fighting the jihadist group in Deir al-Zor province.

The United States has said it will take the lead in helping to clear rubble and restore basic services to the city.

With Islamic State’s self-declared “caliphate” crumbling in its last remaining Syrian strongholds, Assad’s Russian allies said on Thursday the fight with the jihadist group would soon be over.

President Vladimir Putin expressed hope a new peace conference could be convened, though the Kremlin said on Friday it was too early to discuss the timing or venue for the proposed “congress of the peoples of Syria”.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.

Bank of America (ABC.N) jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s (AAPL.O) 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks.

Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.

The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

“It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

“Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.”

Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - U.S. home solar companies, believing President Donald Trump will soon slap tariffs on imported panels and make their systems more expensive, are using that threat to juice their slowing sales.

Top independent installer Sunrun Inc (RUN.O) and smaller rivals, many of which are part of an aggressive industry lobbying effort opposed to new tariffs on panels, are warning homeowners considering going solar to sign up before tariffs cause prices to rise.

On its web site, Sunrun warns visitors that panel prices could double in 2018, raising the cost of an average installation by $3,000.

“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.

Smaller, local installers and solar advocates from California to Massachusetts are also raising the prospect of higher prices at sales consultations, in blog posts and at community events like farmer’s markets.

“We are really urging people not to wait until 2018,” said Craig Forman, who leads a pro-solar community group in Newton, Massachusetts, that refers interested residents to two local solar contractors.

The marketing strategy comes at a time when the U.S. residential solar industry is in a slump. The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.

There are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term. In the third quarter, the number of new U.S. solar permits issued fell 11 percent from the previous year, though that was an improvement from the 24 percent and 16 percent drops in the first and second quarters, according to OhmHome, an online resource for consumers interested in going solar.

In California, the No. 1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.

In April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.

Solar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.

The residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.

Nevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually. For sales processes that can take up to a year from when a homeowner first inquires about going solar, the trade case is giving potential customers a palpable reason to act now.

“Installers are looking for any reason to get back in touch with the customer and a sense of urgency that will make their sales process be shorter,” Aggarwal said.

Not all installers are talking about the trade case. Tesla, for instance, said it is awaiting the final outcome of the case before alerting potential customers.

Gigawatt Inc, a Placentia, California-based company that installs systems under the name GoGreenSolar.com, has seen a “spike” in sales since it began talking to customers about the trade case, according to CEO Deep Patel.

“In the consumers’ mind prices are going to go down. Cell phones got cheaper, TVs got cheaper,” said Patel. “The last thing you want to do is tell them ‘Hey, Mr Smith, the project costs went up a couple of grand.'”

CAIRO (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and eight others injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital, two security sources said on Friday.

The sources said authorities were following a lead to an apartment thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and policemen since last year.

The suspected militants fled after the exchange of fire there, the sources said.

LONDON (Reuters) - For the Bank of England, the hard bit about finally raising interest rates will be getting borrowers to heed the message it is likely to send: that they should not fear many more hikes any time soon.

Britons have not seen their debt costs rise since July 2007, shortly before the financial crisis which pushed the world’s fifth-biggest economy into its deepest recession in decades.

READ: Bank of England's Cunliffe says no clear case for rate hike soon

Now, eight years into the recovery, the BoE is saying it is likely to raise rates “in the coming months”. Investors mostly say that means as soon as Nov. 2, after its next policy meeting.

At one level, increasing Bank Rate to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent would represent only a reversal of last year’s emergency rate cut after the shock Brexit vote.

But many British businesses are worried it might have an outsized impact on the mindset of consumers.

“When I have been around the country, businesses have been asking a lot about the Bank of England,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

“There is nervousness about the psychological impact of the first increase.”

READ: MPs voice worry over Bank of England's lack of diversity

The messaging challenge could be all the harder after several failed attempts in recent years by Governor Mark Carney and the BoE to signal when rates were likely to rise.

The guidance was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call Carney an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014, an epithet that has stuck.

In June, sterling fell and then rose as Carney made two speeches in eight days in which he seemed to change the emphasis of his message away from being in no hurry to consider a rate hike to saying one might become necessary.

It remains unclear if the BoE will pull the trigger in November. Most economists polled by Reuters last month said the time was not right for a hike, yet they still expected the BoE to press on.

British inflation is at a five-year high of 3 percent, above the BoE’s 2 percent target. But the economy is facing deep uncertainty about Britain’s departure from the European Union and is growing at half the pace of the euro zone.

NOT THAT BIG A DEAL?

Paul Fisher, a BoE rate-setter until 2014, said raising rates once by 25 basis points was “not that big a deal”.

“The key thing is what they say alongside it,” he said. “The Bank has been out of the game ... in terms of affecting ordinary people’s lives. It might suddenly become part of their consciousness again, especially the people who pay a mortgage.”

The BoE has said repeatedly that it expects to raise rates in a “limited and gradual” way, echoing the caution among many other central banks about the fragility of their economies.

Economists say it will probably continue to send that cautious message after its first move.

Financial markets expect the BoE to make only one 25-basis point rate hike in 2018 after a first increase next month.

It remains to be seen whether British consumers, the main drivers of the economy, see it that way too.

“On the occasions when the Bank has tried to signal quite clearly that they’re making just a one-off hike, households haven’t listened to the nuanced guidance,” Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.

“They see their mortgage rates going up and they prepare for more increases in that direction.”

When the BoE last raised rates in 2007, it said it had made no judgement on its next move. But the balance of households expecting a hike over the next 12 months stood at double the historical average a month later and consumer confidence fell, Tombs said.

BoE officials, like their peers around the world, have tried increasingly to find the best way to speak to borrowers.

In contrast to the days when central banks operated in near-secrecy and did not even publicly announce rate changes, Carney gives regular media interviews to speak directly to consumers and companies whose spending drives the economy.

But things do not always go to plan.

Carney has often had to challenge the idea that the BoE’s guidance on rates represents a rock-solid promise. That nuance is often lost in media reporting, BoE officials complain.

“It’s not always fully understood,” the central bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane told reporters after speaking at an event in London earlier this month. “When the data changes and the facts change, our view needs to evolve. That doesn’t mean the view was wrong before. The facts sometimes change.”

This time, however, even economists who think the BoE would be making a mistake by raising rates in November say it looks likely to happen, even if only to avoid another communications misfire that could further complicate its messaging task.

Jean Michel Six, chief economist in Europe for ratings agency Standard & Poor‘s, said the BoE ran the risk of losing credibility if it continued to hold off.

“It’s a bit of a vicious circle. Once you go too far in the direction of saying you may very well increase rates, you have to do it. Otherwise you lose your credibility,” Six said.

“It’s a game you can only play for some time.”

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.

The FTSE 100, which hit a record level last week, was on track for a slight weekly loss after four weeks of robust gains, bruised by sharp drops earlier in the week from Convatec (CTEC.L) and Merlin (MERL.L).

British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled talks with the European Union as EU leaders said they would begin preparations to move into the second phase of Brexit talks in December.

The pound strengthened to 89.295 pence per euro EURGBP=D3, having earlier dipped to its weakest since Oct. 12. That left it up 0.8 percent on the day.

Unilever (ULVR.L) and Reckitt (RB.L) were among the leading decliners after weak results earlier this week, closing down 3.2 and 2.7 percent respectively.

“When companies disappoint they’re getting properly spanked. In the big stocks Unilever has been particularly weak after results. The market is in an unforgiving mood,” said Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton Group.

Miner Fresnillo (FRES.L) was the top FTSE 100 loser, closing 3.6 percent lower, after a downgrade to “neutral” from top-ranked Credit Suisse analyst Ivano Westin on the grounds that it was now well-priced.

Like fellow miners Antofagasta (ANTO.L), Glencore (GLEN.L) and Rio Tinto (RIO.L), it has been lifted by London copper prices, on track for their fourth weekly gain and fresh from three-year highs.

Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and RSA Insurance (RSA.L) were among the biggest boosts to the index, up 3.1 and 2.4 percent, after the U.S. Senate passed a budget blueprint seen as a key step towards tax cuts that the market hopes will aid financials.

Mid-caps .FTMC closed up 0.1 percent, recovering from their worst day in a month when workspace group IWG (IWG.L) slumped 34 percent after results. The FTSE 250 hit a record close on Wednesday.

“It’s quite surprising how well the FTSE 250 has held up since the referendum,” said Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at Kiillik & Co. “If I were a company exposed just to the UK I would not be investing and expanding at the moment.”

“Most UK fund managers are overweight the mid-caps, so if we do see a lot of profit warnings we might see them re-assessing how much they want to hold companies there,” she added.

Shares in Acacia Mining (ACAA.L) fell back 8.1 percent after third-quarter earnings came in below consensus estimates.

The gold miner had soared 16 percent on Thursday after its owner Barrick Gold (ABX.TO) struck a deal with the Tanzanian government to settle a tax dispute. But Acacia said on Friday it would need to approve the deal and was seeking further clarification.

“We expect quarterly earnings to be largely looked through as investors focus on gaining more clarity following yesterday’s announcements,” said Jefferies analysts.

Small-cap Interserve (IRV.L), which also plummeted on Thursday after a profit warning, jumped back 16.8 percent after the support services firm won a 227 million pound contract with the British government.

Overall analysts have downgraded their earnings expectations for the FTSE 100 into third-quarter results as a boost from sterling’s depreciation fades.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because the White House has not been forthcoming with details of an ambush in Niger that left four U.S. soldiers dead.

The attack earlier this month, which U.S. officials suspect was carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African country, which has about 800 U.S. troops.

“It may require a subpoena,” McCain said when asked what steps his committee might need to take to determine what happened to the four troops.

Questioned what information the committee still needed, McCain said: “Everything.”

Asked whether the White House had been forthcoming with the information needed by the committee, he added, “of course not.”

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a Pentagon investigation is aimed at finding out what happened in Niger.

“An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll. The fact is, they need to find out what happened and why it happened,” he said during an appearance in the White House briefing room.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military’s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

Initially, the Pentagon announced that three soldiers had been killed in the ambush. The body of a fourth soldier, Sergeant La David T. Johnson, was recovered more than a day later and questions have been raised about why it took as long as it did.

“The U.S. military does not leave its troops behind and I would just ask that you not question the actions of the troops who were caught in the firefight and question whether or not they did everything they could in order to bring everyone out at once,” Mattis said before the start of a meeting with his Israeli counterpart.

McCain said he had had a good conversation with President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and hoped the White House would eventually provide the information needed by the committee.

From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles.

The mission had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for America’s elite commandos and there was no armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.

Mattis said contact was considered “unlikely” but did not provide further details.

“There’s a reason we have U.S. Army soldiers there and not the Peace Corps, because we carry guns. And so it’s a reality, it’s part of the danger that our troops face,” he said.

Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead.

U.S. officials have said French aircraft were overhead within 30 minutes.

Mattis said a contract aircraft evacuated the dead U.S. soldiers and Johnson’s body was found later by local nationals.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the soldiers were in the area to establish relations with local leaders and deemed it unlikely that they would meet resistance.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North American department of North Korea’s foreign ministry, told a non-proliferation conference in Moscow Washington would “have to put up” with North Korea’s nuclear status, RIA reported.

“This is a matter of life and death for us. The current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack.”

“We will respond to fire with fire.”

Pyongyang would regard any attempts to strangle the country via U.N. Security Council sanctions as an attempt “to declare war”.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing the same conference earlier on Friday, urged world powers to get behind a joint Russian-Chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over North Korea’s weapons programme.

“We are convinced that its implementation will promote the lessening of military activity and tension on the Korean peninsula and the forming in Northeastern Asia of a system of equal and indivisible security,” he said.

The plan proposes a moratorium on North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons tests, while South Korea and the United States suspend holding military exercises.

“The main task at the current stage is to prevent a military conflict which will inevitably lead to a large-scale humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,” Lavrov said. “All the sides involved should exercise restraint.”

LONDON (Reuters) - For the Bank of England, the hard bit about finally raising interest rates will be getting borrowers to heed the message it is likely to send: that they should not fear many more hikes any time soon.

Britons have not seen their debt costs rise since July 2007, shortly before the financial crisis which pushed the world’s fifth-biggest economy into its deepest recession in decades.

Now, eight years into the recovery, the BoE is saying it is likely to raise rates “in the coming months”. Investors mostly say that means as soon as Nov. 2, after its next policy meeting.

At one level, increasing Bank Rate to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent would represent only a reversal of last year’s emergency rate cut after the shock Brexit vote.

But many British businesses are worried it might have an outsized impact on the mindset of consumers.

“When I have been around the country, businesses have been asking a lot about the Bank of England,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

“There is nervousness about the psychological impact of the first increase.”

The messaging challenge could be all the harder after several failed attempts in recent years by Governor Mark Carney and the BoE to signal when rates were likely to rise.

The guidance was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call Carney an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014, an epithet that has stuck.

In June, sterling fell and then rose as Carney made two speeches in eight days in which he seemed to change the emphasis of his message away from being in no hurry to consider a rate hike to saying one might become necessary.

It remains unclear if the BoE will pull the trigger in November. Most economists polled by Reuters last month said the time was not right for a hike, yet they still expected the BoE to press on.

British inflation is at a five-year high of 3 percent, above the BoE’s 2 percent target. But the economy is facing deep uncertainty about Britain’s departure from the European Union and is growing at half the pace of the euro zone.

NOT THAT BIG A DEAL?

Paul Fisher, a BoE rate-setter until 2014, said raising rates once by 25 basis points was “not that big a deal”.

“The key thing is what they say alongside it,” he said. “The Bank has been out of the game ... in terms of affecting ordinary people’s lives. It might suddenly become part of their consciousness again, especially the people who pay a mortgage.”

The BoE has said repeatedly that it expects to raise rates in a “limited and gradual” way, echoing the caution among many other central banks about the fragility of their economies.

Economists say it will probably continue to send that cautious message after its first move.

Financial markets expect the BoE to make only one 25-basis point rate hike in 2018 after a first increase next month.

It remains to be seen whether British consumers, the main drivers of the economy, see it that way too.

“On the occasions when the Bank has tried to signal quite clearly that they’re making just a one-off hike, households haven’t listened to the nuanced guidance,” Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.

“They see their mortgage rates going up and they prepare for more increases in that direction.”

When the BoE last raised rates in 2007, it said it had made no judgement on its next move. But the balance of households expecting a hike over the next 12 months stood at double the historical average a month later and consumer confidence fell, Tombs said.

BoE officials, like their peers around the world, have tried increasingly to find the best way to speak to borrowers.

In contrast to the days when central banks operated in near-secrecy and did not even publicly announce rate changes, Carney gives regular media interviews to speak directly to consumers and companies whose spending drives the economy.

But things do not always go to plan.

Carney has often had to challenge the idea that the BoE’s guidance on rates represents a rock-solid promise. That nuance is often lost in media reporting, BoE officials complain.

“It’s not always fully understood,” the central bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane told reporters after speaking at an event in London earlier this month. “When the data changes and the facts change, our view needs to evolve. That doesn’t mean the view was wrong before. The facts sometimes change.”

This time, however, even economists who think the BoE would be making a mistake by raising rates in November say it looks likely to happen, even if only to avoid another communications misfire that could further complicate its messaging task.

Jean Michel Six, chief economist in Europe for ratings agency Standard & Poor‘s, said the BoE ran the risk of losing credibility if it continued to hold off.

“It’s a bit of a vicious circle. Once you go too far in the direction of saying you may very well increase rates, you have to do it. Otherwise you lose your credibility,” Six said.

“It’s a game you can only play for some time.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
ZUG, Switzerland/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Just three months ago, a tech project called Tezos raised $232 million online in a wildly successful “initial coin offering,” in which new digital currency is parceled out to buyers. At the time, it was the most money ever raised from the public in the white-hot cryptocurrency sector.

But the venture is now in danger of falling apart because of a battle for control playing out behind the scenes, Reuters has learned.

The acrimonious dispute pits Tezos’ two young founders – Arthur and Kathleen Breitman – against Johann Gevers, the president of a Swiss foundation the couple helped establish to handle the coin offering and promote and develop the Tezos computer network.

Under Swiss law, the foundation is supposed to be independent. It holds all of the funds raised, which have mushroomed to more than $400 million in value because the contributions were made in two cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – that have appreciated sharply. But the Breitmans, who still control the Tezos source code through a Delaware company, are seeking to oust the head of the foundation.

An attorney for the Breitmans sent a 46-page letter on Sunday to the two other members of the foundation’s three-person board, calling for Gevers’ prompt removal and seeking to give the couple a “substantial role” in a new structure that would limit the foundation’s responsibilities. The document accuses Gevers of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.” According to Gevers, the two board members later suggested via email that he step aside for a month while they investigate.

Gevers told Reuters he is not stepping down. “As Arthur has done to others before me,” Gevers said, “this is attempted character assassination. It’s a long laundry list of misleading statements and outright lies.” He said the other two board members “are attempting an illegal coup.”

The Breitmans have been trying to control the foundation as if it were their own private entity, Gevers said, by bypassing the foundation’s legal structure and interfering with management and operations. This has resulted in costly delays in developing and launching the Tezos network and new currency, he said.

“They’re unnecessarily putting the project at risk,” he said.

In a written statement sent to Reuters, the Breitmans reiterated their accusations against Gevers and said they acted “in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.” They said their priority “remains the successful launch of the Tezos network.”

Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake: The Tezos digital coins, called “Tezzies,” are already priced at a hefty premium in futures trading even though they don’t yet exist. The launching of the Tezos network, which will trigger the coins’ release, has been delayed. Until the network launches – and no date is set – contributors to the fundraiser will receive nothing.

Under the terms of the Tezos coin offering, there’s no guarantee participants will ever receive a single Tez. Participants agreed to accept the risk that the project “may be abandoned.” Despite the feud, Gevers said he remains committed to resolving the feud so that “this project succeeds.”

The tale of how two young entrepreneurs raised a fortune for a project barely out of the starting blocks is reported here in detail for the first time. It highlights the risks inherent in the current frenzy for ICOs, in which tech startups issue new cryptocurrencies to raise capital.

Reuters reported last month that cryptocurrency exchanges – where virtual currencies are bought, sold and stored – have become magnets for fraud and deception. More than 980,000 bitcoins – the most popular virtual currency – have been stolen since 2011. Today they would be worth about $5 billion.

Similar large sums are pouring into initial coin offerings. From January through September, ICOs generated $2.2 billion, more than three times the amount invested in similar startups by traditional venture capital firms, according to Novum Insights, a data provider.

ICOs can be a way for technology projects to raise money online to finance the development of new, open-source computer networks that aren’t necessarily looking to make a profit. Contributors receive new digital coins, or tokens, which they typically need to “pay” to access the new networks.

But the recent flurry of ICOs raising millions of dollars has attracted some dubious business propositions and outright scams, as well as speculators looking to trade the coins for swift gains. Authorities in the United States, Switzerland, China, Singapore and other nations have begun scrutinizing the sector closely for potentially tougher regulation.

“Most ICOs are bought by people looking to ‘flip’ their tokens to a greater fool for a quick profit,” said Alistair Milne, a co-founder of the London-based Altana Digital Currency Fund, which so far has avoided ICOs. More than “90 percent will fall to have a near-zero value in time,” he predicted.

The new cryptocurrencies function through a technology called blockchain, essentially a public ledger maintained by a network of computers. Blockchain applications are being tested by financial services firms, food suppliers, retailers and other businesses as a way to make record-keeping simpler and cheaper. Tezos aims to be a blockchain that’s more reliable than the ones behind bitcoin and ether. Several entrepreneurs and investors in the blockchain industry said the Tezos technology has potential because it would be easier to upgrade and may be more secure than other blockchains.

ANARCHO-CAPITALISM

The son of Jean-Claude Deret, a French playwright and actor, Arthur Breitman studied applied mathematics, computer science and physics in France, before moving to the United States and studying financial mathematics at New York University. He went on to work for the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

He is still listed as a co-organizer and “dear leader” for the New York Anarcho-Capitalist Meetup in New York, which describes its philosophy as “a type of radical libertarianism that favors the abundant wealth production, rapid technological development, and high standards of living produced by capitalism.” Its website adds, “We are also fairly lazy about fighting the state.”

It was at a crypto-anarchist lunch in 2010 that Breitman first met Kathleen McCaffrey, an American college student from New Jersey. She is described on a political blog called The Politicizer as a libertarian Republican who first became interested in politics after listening to the provocative radio personality Rush Limbaugh at the age of five. She married Breitman in 2013.

Kathleen Breitman, now 27, later worked at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and at R3, a blockchain company. In a July post on the conservative website legalinsurrection.com, she said she “didn’t get along” at the hedge fund but had “a great time” at R3.

Bridgewater didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Arthur Breitman, 35, was an early fan of bitcoin, which first appeared around 2009. But he came to believe there were flaws in the blockchains behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, finding them hard to upgrade and not secure. He tried to come up with something better.

In the summer of 2014, while working at Morgan Stanley in quantitative finance, Breitman released two papers online that presented his concept for a new type of blockchain. He called it Tezos, a name his wife has said he coined after creating an algorithm that searched for the names of unclaimed websites pronounceable in English.

The papers were published under a pseudonym, “L. M Goodman,” but emails and messages from Arthur Breitman reviewed by Reuters make it clear he was the author.

In an email Breitman sent to an acquaintance in early 2015, he said he was seeking to create a business based on Tezos but was trying not to be associated publicly with the project at the time. He expressed worry that his activities might conflict with his employment at Morgan Stanley, messages show.

Reuters reviewed a copy of a “Tezos Business Plan” from early 2015, which listed Breitman as chief executive. The plan projected that if the company survived 15 years, it would be worth between $2 billion and $20 billion. The budget called for paying Breitman $212,180 in salary by year three. In August 2015, Breitman, who was still working at Morgan Stanley, set up a company in Delaware called Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc, or DLS, to develop Tezos. He listed himself as chief executive.

The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requires registered securities professionals to provide prior written notice to their employer to conduct outside business activities if there is “reasonable expectation of compensation.” According to FINRA records, Breitman was registered and did not report any “other business activities.” Morgan Stanley and FINRA declined to comment.

“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June. “It was a hobby, you know. And like there was never any intention to really commercialize any of the software.” She added: “We had some meetings with like C-suite executives at banks ... but honestly nothing serious.”

“A TERRIBLE SALESMAN”

In 2015, Arthur Breitman was pitching “Tezos Inc.” in the hope of creating a consortium of four to five banks to adopt the technology and fund the operation. The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.

By then, blockchain was beginning to pique the interest of large financial institutions for its potential to help cut costs of cumbersome back-office processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities trades. Tezos’ 37-page business plan called it “an Internet for financial transactions” and said the technology could be used to automate the over-the-counter derivatives trading market.

But Breitman failed to attract backers. He told Reuters in June that he blamed his fundraising failures on the decision to develop the technology first, rather than just selling “a dream” as other blockchain startups were doing.

“I guess I was a terrible salesman as well,” he said.

“I can speak to that,” his wife said.

In April 2016, Arthur left Morgan Stanley, and by that September, the Breitmans had started working on a new strategy for Tezos – to conduct an online fundraiser to distribute digital tokens, whose holders would maintain the Tezos blockchain. But the couple needed funds to keep the project going.

Over the next six months, they received $612,000 from 10 early backers, including several cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to the Tezos.com website.

To conduct the ICO, the Breitmans chose a complex structure. Earlier this year, they helped to create a foundation based in Zug, Switzerland – dubbed “Crypto Valley” because of its many blockchain startups – that is seeking not-for-profit status, emails show. The idea, according to documents on the Tezos website, was that the foundation would raise money via the ICO, then acquire DLS, the Breitman-controlled company that has been developing Tezos.

Working through a Swiss foundation, the Breitmans thought, would provide regulatory oversight but not too much. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June that she and her husband opted to use a foundation based in Zug because Switzerland has “a regulatory authority that had a sufficient amount of oversight but not like anything too crazy.”

Georg von Schnurbein, co-author of a book on Swiss foundation governance, expressed surprise over cryptocurrency ventures like Tezos setting up not-for-profit foundations in Switzerland. “For me, the public interest is not clear,” he said. While not illegal, he said, creating a foundation with the aim of allowing inventors to profit from a sale conflicted with its status as a not-for-profit, which is supposed to benefit the public. He said federal regulators eventually might prohibit it.

“The issue that there is some kind of for-profit entity and there are transfers right at the beginning is something that is working at the moment, but won’t be sustainable,” he said.

“EXAGGERATED, TO SAY THE LEAST”

As work continued for the ICO, which was originally scheduled to be held in May, the project started running out of cash, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters. She spoke with Tim Draper, the well-known founding partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm DFJ and a staunch bitcoin supporter. He invested $1.5 million through his firm, Draper Associates, which included taking a minority stake in DLS, the company that controls the Tezos source code.

The Breitmans had also hired Strange Brew Strategies, a U.S. communications company, to promote their project, and Reuters wrote a news story on May 5 about Draper’s involvement.

In pitching the story to Reuters, John O‘Brien, a principal of Strange Brew, had made claims about Tezos’ progress. He wrote: “The applications of Tezos, ranging from derivatives settlement to micro-insurance, are real and recognized by industry giants. Ernst & Young, Deloitte, LexiFi, etc. have adopted Tezos in their development environments and labs.”

On Oct. 3, a spokeswoman for the accounting firm Ernst & Young told Reuters: “The statement is not correct. EY has not adopted Tezos.” A spokesman for Deloitte said Tezos’ code is “one of many technologies we’re considering” with blockchain, but it’s “still early stage and we haven’t used the technology for a client project.”

Jean-Marc Eber, CEO of the French software company LexiFi, said, “The sentence, as stated, isn’t accurate and unfortunately exaggerated, to say the least.” While there had been “informal contacts,” he said, “at this stage, LexiFi has not adopted Tezos’ technology in its development environment or labs.”

Strange Brew declined to answer questions about the statement.

INVESTMENT OR DONATION?

The Tezos fundraiser began on July 1. The Breitmans had wide-ranging expectations about how much they might raise. A document on Tezos.com suggested that if they received more than $20 million, they might use it to “negotiate with a small nation-state” to adopt Tezzies, or acquire mainstream print and TV media outlets to promote the technology. In June, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that about a year ago, when the price of bitcoin was lower, “we were like, ‘Hey, we would be lucky if we get 20 million.'”

When it ended after 13 days, the project received about 66,000 bitcoins and 361,000 ethers, worth about $232 million at the time. The hoard is now worth about twice that.

Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that participating in the Tezos fundraiser was like contributing to a public television station and receiving “a tote bag” in return. “That’s kind of the same thing here,” she said.

The fundraiser’s terms called the contributions “a non-refundable donation” and not a “speculative investment.”

If deemed a donation, and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of financial regulators in the United States. In the U.S., investments in assets such as company shares and other securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been studying ICOs, and in July issued an investor bulletin that warned: “Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.”

Part of the SEC’s assessment is to examine the reasonable expectations of participants in the ICO. Some participants in the Tezos fundraiser told Reuters they viewed the coins at least partly as an investment.

Kevin Zhou, co-founder of the cryptocurrency trading fund Galois Capital, said he invested about five bitcoins in Tezos, which he considers overall one of the better ICOs.

“For me and for a lot of people this is an investment. We are looking for a return,” Zhou said. “I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.

Draper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation. Asked this month how much he donated during the Tezos fundraiser, he replied via email, “You mean how much I bought? A lot.”

“TOTAL MENSCH”

At the moment, the Tezos Foundation holds all of the fundraising proceeds, while the Breitmans, through their Delaware company, control much of Tezos’ intellectual property. The plan is for the foundation to acquire the Breitmans’ company and release the technology under a free software license, according a “Transparency Memo” on the Tezos website.

Gevers, who founded the Tezos Foundation, said it has a contract that stipulates the Breitmans will either sell the Delaware company to the foundation “within a reasonable point of time” or, if they don‘t, “the foundation can take it.” He declined to provide a copy of the contract.

When the foundation will acquire the Breitmans’ company remains unclear. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June, “Essentially, you know, they’re going to buy out the company in like July or so, I guess.”

The Breitmans stand to receive millions of dollars if the deal goes through. According to the “Transparency Memo,” the new blockchain “must launch and operate successfully” for three months, then DLS’s shareholders – the Breitmans and Draper – are entitled to receive 8.5 percent of the fundraiser proceeds in cash. That amount, according to Gevers, is about $19.7 million. The shareholders also are slated to receive another 10 percent of the Tezzies issued, with the coin distribution spread out over four years. Those coins currently are worth about $140 million in futures trading.

Prior to the fundraiser, Kathleen Breitman effused about Gevers, 52, a Zug-based South African entrepreneur who has never before run a foundation. During an “Ask Me Anything” session in May on an online chat channel, she posted: “He’s awesome. Total mensch and very philosophically committed to our project.”

Relations later soured. The Breitmans objected to people the foundation suggested it wanted to hire, Gevers said. Another sticking point: The couple’s company hasn’t relinquished control over the foundation’s own website, www.tezos.ch.

“They control the foundation’s domains, websites and email servers, so the foundation has no control or confidentiality in its own communications,” Gevers said.

The Breitmans officially have no role at the Tezos Foundation. The letter from their lawyer this week proposed the creation of two foundation subsidiaries – Tezos AG and Tezos France SA – to develop and support Tezos, with the Breitmans serving as chief executive and chief technology officer of Tezos AG. The couple also would be given “observer status” on the foundation board. The foundation would then “limit” its activities to supervising and supporting the subsidiaries, “rather than conducting any direct operations.”

According to von Schnurbein, under Swiss law “the foundation is completely independent and the foundation board is completely independent.” Gevers said the foundation wants the couple to continue playing a leading advisory role. “They are both very competent people and obviously they started this whole thing. And it would be stupid to exclude them.”

But he added: “You can rest assured as long as I have anything to do with this, the foundation will be independent.”

Gevers said he has filed a complaint with Swiss regulators about the request he received via email this week from the foundation’s two other board members that he step down from the board for a month. A spokesman for Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, which oversees the agency that supervises foundations, told Reuters that asking a board member to step aside must be done at a board meeting, not via email. The two board members who emailed Gevers didn’t respond to a request for comment.

As for the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies raised in the ICO, Gevers said the foundation has slowly begun selling the virtual currencies – lately about $10.2 million worth a week – and plans to invest the proceeds in a diverse portfolio. The funds are intended to be used to run the foundation, ensure Tezos works and help to develop products using the technology.

So where are all the bitcoins and ethers raised in the ICO stored? That, Gevers said, was confidential.

“These are not held in any one place,” he said, “but secured through high-security” digital wallets “that no single party has control over.”

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.
Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant.

The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas.
The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
It seems there’s a template that critics follow for Donald Trump versus the Hurricanes: they say he won’t do enough, that it isn’t being done fast enough, that everything will collapse (ready Katrina headlines) and then the draining, heroic reality of the response takes hold. With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.

Another bow, another apology .... As Kobe Steel says it's not only inspection procedures that have been slipping away ... But customers too. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) KOBE STEEL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, NAOTO UMEHARA, SAYING: "Because we have forfeited our trust, I cannot say that there are no customers that have halted orders or switched suppliers. There are." They haven't been named as yet. But executives also admitted that already widespread data falsification had extended to its mainstream steel sheet business. And confessed Kobe had violated statutory standards - not just customer specifications. The steelmaker's share price sank further on the news. Adding to a 40 per cent slide in under two weeks that's wiped 1.6 billion dollars off the market value of the company. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) KOBE STEEL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, NAOTO UMEHARA, SAYING: "Based on this case, we have decided to replace our internal quality investigation department to a third-party panel." Customers globally - including aircraft manufacturers and car makers - have scrambled to identify potential hazards in Kobe materials supplied to them. None so far have been reported. But in Europe this week, aviation authorities urged plane makers to avoid using Kobe products. And the US Justice Department launched a probe. The Japanese government too .... Now saying it'll take an 'active role' in getting to the bottom of the scandal .... One of Japan's heavy lifters sinking deeper into crisis.

LONDON (Reuters) - The value of corporate deals with sovereign wealth fund (SWF) participation halved in the third quarter as oil-driven funds continued to take a back seat.

Asian funds GIC of Singapore and CIC of China made all the running.

According to Thomson Reuters data, SWFs participated in deals worth just $14.1 billion, down from a revised $28.3 billion April-June, even though the number of deals rose to 38 from 31 quarter-on-quarter.

The second quarter’s total, however, was swollen by China Investment Corp’s (CIC) whopping $13.7 billion acquisition of warehouse firm Logicor, Europe’s biggest ever private equity real estate deal.

In a continuation of the previous quarter’s trend, CIC and GIC remained the most acquisitive funds, with CIC involved in 14 deals and GIC 10.

“The sovereign funds that are active are those that are generating current account trade surpluses,” said Michael Power, a strategist at Investec Asset Management.

In contrast, the oil-backed funds have been less acquisitive in recent quarters, reflecting the constraints imposed by persistent low oil prices.

Markus Massi, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, said another reason for the dominance of the Asian funds was that they had specialist teams looking for deals.

“The Asians are actively going out and scouting. If you’re a private equity company and you want to close a deal, it’s easier to go to someone who already has the knowledge and capability on the other side.”

GIC participated in the top three deals, the largest being a $6.4 billion offer for Danish payments processor Nets by newly-formed company Evergood 5. The deal was backed by a consortium that included GIC, led by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman.

The second largest was the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hong Kong-based insurer MassMutual Asia by another investor group that included GIC.

The rise in the number of consortium deals has gone hand-in-hand with ballooning deal sizes. “There is so much firepower available at the moment, you can go hunting for larger assets,” said Massi.

GIC also led a $220 million funding round for Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform Dianrong.

Power said the barriers to entry for most financial services were falling so sovereign funds needed to protect their portfolios by diversifying into the new players.

“It’s the tech-driven disruptors that are starting to redefine what financial services means,” he said.

Eight of CIC’s investments were in healthcare, a hotly-sought after area, and two in real estate. This followed last quarter’s Logicor buy and CIC’s involvement in the consortium that bought InterPark, the largest owner-operator of parking infrastructure in the United States.

This time GIC clinched the biggest real estate deal, taking a stake in the property rental unit of India’s DLF.

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Dieselgate und Kartellvorwürfe werfen die großen deutschen Autobauer nicht aus der Bahn: Daimler peilt trotz eines Gewinnrückgangs im dritten Quartal, der an Rückrufkosten lag, weiter ein Ergebnisplus von mehr als zehn Prozent in diesem Jahr an.

“Daimler ist erfolgreich unterwegs”, erklärte Vorstandschef Dieter Zetsche am Freitag. Die robuste Pkw-Nachfrage in China und Europa macht die Absatzflaute in den USA mehr als wett. VW-Chef Matthias Müller kündigte für 2017 sogar das beste Ergebnis in der Geschichte des Volkswagen-Konzerns an. “Und nächstes Jahr wird es noch besser”, sagte Müller am Vorabend auf einer Veranstaltung in Passau. “Wir können haushalten”, betonte er mit Blick auf die nach wie vor teuren Altlasten. Analysten rechnen damit, dass VW bei Vorlage der Quartalsbilanz am 27. Oktober die Prognose anhebt.

Arndt Ellinghorst vom Investmentberater Evercore ISI erklärte, die Autokonjunktur erreiche jetzt den Höhepunkt. “Man kann von den Unternehmen nicht erwarten, dass sie die Ergebnisse endlos steigern”, sagte er. “Ich finde, die halten sich dafür alle sehr gut.” Schließlich kämpfen die Autobauer an mehreren Fronten gleichzeitig: Das durch jahrelange Abgas-Manipulationen stark beschädigte Image von Dieselautos beschleunigt den Umschwung zu Elektrofahrzeugen. Dies verschlingt ebenso wie die Entwicklung selbstfahrender, vernetzter Autos Milliarden. Und statt nur Autos zu verkaufen, müssen sich die Hersteller zu Anbietern von Mobilitätsdiensten wie Car-Sharing wandeln, mit sehr unsicheren Profitaussichten.

“UNGLÜCKLICHE UMSTÄNDE”

Bei Daimler belastete die freiwillige Nachrüstung von mehr als drei Millionen Dieselautos zusammen mit einer anderen Rückrufaktion wegen Airbags das Betriebsergebnis mit fast einer halben Milliarde Euro. Der Gewinn vor Steuern und Zinsen (Ebit) sank von Juli bis September um 14 Prozent auf 3,45 Milliarden Euro. Ohne diese “unglücklichen Umstände” sehe der Trend bei den Schwaben jedoch gut aus, erklärten die Analysten von Bernstein-Research, die der Aktie einen Anstieg um gut 15 auf 85 Euro zutrauen. Am Freitag notierte das Papier nach anfänglichen Gewinnen unverändert, allerdings bewegte sich auch der Dax insgesamt nicht von der Stelle.

Die um Sonderfaktoren bereinigte Rendite im Pkw-Geschäft der Sparte Mercedes-Benz Cars sei mit 11,1 Prozent nur geringfügig hinter dem Vorjahresstand zurückgeblieben, erklärte Branchenexperte Marc-René Tonn von der Bank Warburg. Zudem ist das Lkw-Geschäft auf Erholungskurs. Die zweitgrößte Sparte steigerte das Betriebsergebnis fast um ein Drittel auf 614 Millionen Euro, so dass Daimler die Gewinnprognose für das Gesamtjahr hier ebenfalls auf ein deutliches Plus von mehr als zehn Prozent anhob. Unter dem Strich erwirtschaftete der Weltmarktführer des Premiumsegments ein Konzernergebnis von 2,26 Milliarden Euro, 17 Prozent weniger als vor Jahresfrist. Der Umsatz legte um sechs Prozent auf 40,8 Milliarden Euro zu.

Das operativ starke Geschäft wird allerdings von Rechtsrisiken überschattet: Ähnlich wie bei VW gibt es auch gegen Daimler Vorwürfe, Dieselabgase manipuliert zu haben. Den Wolfsburger Konzern kostete das schon 25 Milliarden Euro, vor allem für hohe Bußgelder in den USA. Daimler ist zudem so wie VW im Visier der Staatsanwaltschaft, die wegen des Betrugsverdachts mit Diesel-Abgaswerten ermittelt. Frank Schwope, Autoanalyst von der NordLB warnte, hieraus könnten theoretisch noch Milliarden-Lasten entstehen.

Zusammen mit den anderen Autobauern stehen die Schwaben außerdem unter Kartellverdacht in Europa. Nach einem Bericht des “Spiegel” vom Juli sollen sie sich in den 90er Jahren in großem Stil über Märkte und Strategien abgesprochen haben. Finanzchef Bodo Uebber erklärte, Daimler habe in der Sache Kronzeugenstatus bei der EU beantragt. Im Gegenzug könnte dem Konzern eine Strafe erlassen werden. Rücklagen dafür seien nicht notwendig.

BEWEGLICHER WERDEN

Trotz dieser Probleme fühlt sich Daimler stark genug, den Konzern umzubauen. Vorstandschef Zetsche will auf diese Weise Wachstumschancen besser ausschöpfen, wie er zu Wochenbeginn angekündigt hatte. Aus bislang fünf Divisionen sollen drei eigenständige Töchter werden: Das Pkw- und das Nutzfahrzeuggeschäft sollen voneinander getrennt und neben den Finanzdiensten als eigenständige Aktiengesellschaften etabliert werden. Es wäre der größte Umbau seit der Trennung vom US-Autobauer Chrysler vor rund zehn Jahren.

Die endgültige Entscheidung wird nach eingehender Prüfung zwar erst 2019 fallen. Doch der Konzern steckt 100 Millionen Euro in die Vorbereitungsarbeiten, wie Finanzchef Uebber erklärte. Als eigenständige Einheit könnten die Sparten einfacher Überkreuzbeteiligungen mit Partnerunternehmen, etwa aus der IT-Branche eingehen. Analysten lobten den Plan. Daimler werde dadurch flexibler und beweglicher, erklärte etwa Stefan Bauknecht, Chef-Aktienanalyst der Deutsche-Bank-Tochter Deutsche Asset Management. “Allerdings wäre mehr Transparenz und Offenheit über die weitere ‘Roadmap’ nötig.”

Sur une base ajustée, le bénéfice par action du conglomérat américain s‘est établi à 29 cents alors que les analystes attendaient 49 cents, selon Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Il était de 32 cents il y a un an.

En avant-Bourse, le titre recule de 4,6% à 22,50 dollars. Depuis le début de l‘année, General Electric a enregistré la pire performance du Dow Jones avec un repli de 25,3% contre une hausse de 17,1% pour l‘indice phare la Bourse de New York, en raison notamment des inquiétudes sur la génération de trésorerie, le dividende et les prévisions de bénéfice.

La faiblesse des activités dans le secteur de l‘énergie, du pétrole et du gaz, les dépréciations et des coûts de restructuration plus élevés que prévu ont été les principales causes de la baisse du bénéfice, a dit le PDG John Flannery.

La performance “solide” de GE dans d‘autres activités “n‘a pas suffi à compenser une baisse des performances du pôle énergie dans un marché difficile”, a-t-il ajouté.

Le bénéfice de son activité énergie, qui construit des centrales électriques et des équipements pour le secteur, a chuté de 51% sur le trimestre.

Le cash flow (génération de trésorerie) issu des activités industrielles a diminué essentiellement en raison du recul en volume de l‘activité d‘électricité, ce qui a entraîné une baisse du bénéfice et une hausse des stocks.

Le bénéfice de la division électricité a chuté de 51% au cours du trimestre.

Hors éléments exceptionnels, le cash flow des activités industrielles est ressorti à 1,74 milliard de dollars sur la période, contre 2,90 milliards de dollars un an auparavant.

Le conglomérat a enregistré un chiffre d‘affaires total en hausse de 14,4% à 33,47 millions de dollars, en partie grâce à l‘acquisition du groupe de services pétroliers Baker Hughes. Il était de 29,27 milliards de dollars il y a un an.

Le bénéfice non-ajusté tiré des opérations poursuivies a reculé à 1,80 milliard de dollars sur la période juin-septembre contre 1,99 milliard de dollars un an plus tôt. Cela donne un bénéfice par action de 22 cents contre 24 cents.

India woke up to roads littered with layers of firecracker waste on Friday (October 20), a day after celebration of Diwali- Hindu festival of lights. Diwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India's majority Hindu community. The scene in New Delhi looked no different from the previous years despite the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers early this month to prevent a repeat of severe pollution levels that left the capital choking. However, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers. A local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions. Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years. Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.

Adidas plans to use the factory - and another due to open soon in Atlanta, Georgia, to produce small batches designed for particular markets, and ultimately for individual consumers, in contrast to mass production runs ordered months in advance.

The idea is to respond faster to fashion trends and offer more customization. After London it plans shoe models inspired by Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.

“It is an opportunity for us to disrupt with brand new technologies and bring that as fast as possible to consumers,” David Drury, director of development for footwear sourcing, told Reuters.

Adidas relies on more than one million workers in factories in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam, to produce about 600 million pairs of shoes and items of clothing and accessories per year.

But it is shifting some production closer to its major markets so it can deliver new styles quicker, and counter rising wages in Asia and hefty shipping costs.

It currently takes Adidas up to 18 months to design, produce and deliver most products, but it wants to cut that to as little as 45 days.

Its customized shoes will also command premium prices. The AM4LDN shoe aimed at the London market will go on sale next week for 169.95 pounds ($222.74) or 219.95 euros ($259.85).

Rival Nike has also announced plans to shorten product development times and last month launched a studio in New York where customers can select the color and pattern of their shoes and have them ready in less than 90 minutes.

PARIS (Reuters) - Les syndicats doivent parvenir à s‘entendre sur des propositions communes pour peser davantage sur les réformes à venir, a déclaré vendredi le secrétaire général de la CFDT, Laurent Berger, au lendemain d‘une manifestation organisée par la CGT et marquée par une très faible participation.

Les organisations syndicales, qui n‘étaient pas parvenues à s‘entendre sur un message commun lors d‘une première rencontre intersyndicale la semaine dernière, doivent se réunir à nouveau au siège de la CFDT mardi prochain.

“Nous avons décidé de nous retrouver pour regarder ce que nous pouvions porter ensemble sur la formation professionnelle, sur l‘apprentissage, sur l‘assurance chômage et, plus globalement, sur la réduction des inégalités et la justice sociale”, a dit Laurent Berger à l‘issue d‘une rencontre avec la ministre du Travail, Muriel Pénicaud, sur les réformes à venir.

“Parler d‘une même voix pour porter des propositions pour les demandeurs d‘emploi, pour les salariés, afin de peser dans les discussions avec le patronat et le gouvernement, ce serait une bonne chose”, a-t-il précisé.

La CGT, elle, souhaite profiter de la rencontre intersyndicale pour fixer une date pour une journée d‘action en commun contre la réforme, désormais adoptée, du Code du travail.

Elle n‘était pas parvenue à convaincre les syndicats qui étaient prêts à rejoindre le mouvement de contestation, FO et la CFE-CGC, à la soutenir pour une troisième manifestation jeudi.

Cette journée s‘est soldée par une très faible mobilisation malgré l‘appui de Solidaires, la FSU, le syndicat étudiant Unef et 13 fédérations de la CFE-CGC.

Le ministère de l‘Intérieur a recensé 37.700 manifestants dans le pays, contre 132.000 le 21 septembre et 223.000 le 12 septembre. La CGT, elle, a fait état de la présence de “dizaine de milliers” de personnes.

LES ORDONNANCES, UN “COMBAT” PAS TERMINÉ

Pour Laurent Berger, cette prochaine rencontre ne doit pas servir à fixer une nouvelle journée de manifestation, mais mobiliser les syndicats contre les mesures du gouvernement qui vont à l‘encontre de “la justice sociale”, comme le projet de loi de finances, qualifié de projet de loi pour les “riches” par l‘opposition ou encore la “baisse des contrats aidés” et des aides au logement.

Déçu par les ordonnances qui ne garantissent pas, selon lui, suffisamment de dialogue social, le syndicaliste réclame maintenant des “résultats” sur les réformes sur l‘apprentissage, la formation professionnelle et l‘assurance chômage.

Ces réformes, qui visent à “sécuriser les travailleurs”, constituent le deuxième grand chantier social du quinquennat d‘Emmanuel Macron après celui du Code du travail qui devait donner plus de “souplesse” aux entreprises.

Son discours trouve écho chez le président de la CFTC, Philippe Louis, autre syndicat qui se dit réformiste.

“On peut comprendre que les entreprises aient besoin de s‘adapter. Nous, on a dit d‘accord à plus de souplesse, mais on veut que les parcours professionnels des salariés soient sécurisés”, a-t-il dit jeudi à Reuters.

“Il faut que les salariés puissent se former plus facilement. C‘est la contrepartie.”

Pour Laurent Berger, le “combat” contre les ordonnances publiées le 23 septembre, n‘est toutefois pas terminé.

“La page s‘ouvre”, a-t-il dit. “Maintenant la mobilisation est dans les entreprises, dans notre capacité à faire en sorte qu‘aucune entreprise ne puisse s‘exonérer vraiment du dialogue social.”

There are many worthy markers that America’s Iraq Wars have been a terrible, terrible waste, but as history loves a signature event, let it be the September 25, 2017 Kurdish independence referendum. While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice "Iraq" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a "residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.

(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire employees for stores and for middle and higher management as low pay and a feeling of uncertainty clouds the industry following a spate of bankruptcies and store closures.

(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire employees for stores and for middle and higher management as low pay and a feeling of uncertainty clouds the industry following a spate of bankruptcies and store closures.

Retailers including Macy’s Inc and J.C. Penney have said they will hire the same or fewer seasonal workers for the holidays this year than last, while some, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc, have chosen not to hire temporary workers at all.

Sector observers have attributed this to brick-and-mortar retailers’ retreat under pressure from online players including Amazon, and firms themselves say they have simply taken a staggered approach to hiring this year that fills gaps slowly. Macy’s said holiday hiring was “off to a great start”.

But staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand.

The staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.

“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.

Her clients include Lowe’s Cos Inc, Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs.

U.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the “gig economy” and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool.

The hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month.

The job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.

“There just aren’t enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,” the site’s chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.

NO BONUS

The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs.

Recruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more.

“The jobs have become bigger,” Manpower Group’s Hassett said. “A manager will do more at the stores, they’ll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to.”

Wal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.

“We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,” said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart’s senior manager of corporate communications.

J.C. Penney said it was introducing paid time off for part-time hourly associates, starting from early 2018, to entice seasonal hires to stay beyond the holiday season.

Higher up the food chain, recruiters also point to bonuses that have lagged other industries as harming efforts to draw in and keep talented regional managers or heads of business lines.

“They (retailers) are paying lower bonuses and some companies have paid lower bonuses for a couple of years,” talent acquisition firm Korn Ferry’s retail expert Craig Rowley said.

An analysis by Korn Ferry of 40 big North American retailers showed that 73 percent paid little to no bonuses to senior executives for their performance in 2016. Thirty five percent paid no bonus, up from 25 percent last year.

“It’s the perception of where retail as an industry is going,” Manpower’s Hassett said. “So when the brick-and-mortar retail is really struggling, at that executive level, people are concerned about staying in retail.”

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are "conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control" in places with "a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds." The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense."

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries. Battles have been won on both sides. The war goes on.

TOKYO (Reuters) - For Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, Sunday’s general election has brought into focus the challenge of unwinding a massive stimulus program and yield curve control policy, while not hurting a budding but still fragile economy, the world’s third-largest.

With inflation far below a 2 percent target, the BOJ rules out any near-term exit from Kuroda’s legacy ultra-easy policy.

But there’s growing alarm within the central bank about how long it can keep the money spigot open, given the rising costs and diminishing returns, people familiar with BOJ thinking say.

Most of the BOJ’s nine board members and bureaucrats involved in drafting monetary policy feel the next step - though some way off - would be to roll back Kuroda’s radical monetary experiment, with the economy in recovery-mode, they say.

The political tide is shifting in favor of at least having such a debate.

Several ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) heavyweights have warned of the rising cost of prolonged monetary easing. Opposition parties, including the new Party of Hope led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, want a departure from over-reliance on monetary policy.

“The BOJ may be asked to explain more in parliament how it intends to exit,” said one of the people familiar with BOJ thinking. “That would require some changes in communication.”

BOJ bureaucrats are drafting a plan. The trick is to retreat from crisis-mode stimulus without giving the impression the bank is embarking on outright monetary tightening.

Already, the BOJ is proceeding with the first stage of the plan - by whittling down its vast bond purchases to an annual pace of around 50 trillion yen ($443 billion), below a loose pledge to keep it at around 80 trillion yen.

The next step would be to allow long-term interest rates, which the BOJ has capped at around zero, to rise, more reflecting improvements in the economy, the sources say. The bank could raise the bond yield target or shift it to the shorter end of the curve even before inflation hits 2 percent, as it can maintain easy monetary conditions with its strong balance sheet.

“If long-term rates rise naturally, reflecting improvements in the economy, the BOJ may not need to cap 10-year yields at zero,” one of the people said. It could then raise short-term rates, though reducing the size of its balance sheet could be years away.

LEARNING FROM THE FED

After a massive asset-buying program that Kuroda deployed in 2013 failed to fire up inflation, the BOJ reverted last September to a policy targeting interest rates.

Since then, the bank has begun to more openly debate an exit.

Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso said the BOJ can learn from the U.S. Federal Reserve when withdrawing stimulus, while another deputy governor said the BOJ is conducting exit simulations.

Kuroda concedes that meeting the inflation goal will take time as shocking the public out of deflation proved tough - a sea change from his 2013 pledge the target could be met in just two years.

Gone, too, are his threats to ramp up stimulus to reach his price target sooner.

Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the shift to yield curve control a year ago was a normalization of monetary policy in a narrow sense.

“Everybody says nowadays that a central bank’s goal is price stability or stable low-rate inflation. But what we really care about is people’s well being,” he said. “I don’t think (the BOJ) needs to add stimulus.”

COST OF DELAY

Delaying an exit from the ultra-loose policy could be costly.

As the U.S. Fed and the European Central Bank begin to roll back post-financial crisis unconventional policies, the divergence could trigger market turbulence.

Bound by near-zero rates, the BOJ could be left with fewer tools than its peers to battle another recession.

“The BOJ needs to start normalizing policy, at least from 2018, when the economy is still in good shape,” said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research and a veteran BOJ watcher. “Otherwise, it will lose the window of opportunity to exit.”

Prolonged easing could also destabilize the banking system by eroding bank profits, a warning the International Monetary Fund made in a report this month.

Still, finding the way out from years of heavy money printing isn’t easy. Any sign of diminishing BOJ presence may jolt the bond market, which saw liquidity dwindle as the bank gobbled up roughly 40 percent of the market.

Stocks are also heavily reliant on the BOJ buying exchange-traded funds, so any slowdown in that could hit stock prices and business sentiment.

And there’s the question of who will next be leading the BOJ.

If Prime Minister Shinzo Abe holds on to power, there’s a good chance he would reappoint Kuroda for another term, analysts say. He’d still have to heed growing calls for more debate on an exit strategy.

Seiko Noda, a cabinet minister seen as Abe’s leadership rival, has called for scrutiny on the rising cost of prolonged easy policy. And Abe himself no longer calls on the BOJ to do whatever it takes to achieve 2 percent inflation, saying only he hopes the bank will “keep up efforts” to end deflation.

“The biggest flaw of the BOJ’s current framework is the difficulty of an exit,” said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official and now chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

“The BOJ has kept mum on this, but it may change that stance if the political sentiment begins to shift.”

British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

Prime Minister May, brave as she is to shoulder the task, may not be up to it. Foreign Secretary Johnson careless as he is with both the truth and his loyalty, may be. Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister. Such is the mayhem unleashed by the effort to satisfy the popular will.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted prayers for Downie’s family, adding that “our hearts break on news of the passing of ... an ally and friend.”

Downie had become an outspoken supporter of Canada’s indigenous people, penning songs about the painful legacy of colonialism and urging Canadians toward reconciliation.

In their statement, Downie’s family said the singer had spent his last days making music and memories with family and friends.

“Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years - those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars,” the statement said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”

The UK's decision to leave the EU has at times left British Prime Minister Theresa May looking like the unpopular kid at school. Not so on Thursday (October 19). The choreography on the first day of this European Union summit showing May talking animatedly with the EU's most important leaders - France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel. That as May urged a new dynamic on Brexit talks. At a summit dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May appealed to EU leaders to help her silence her critics at home and break a deadlock in the talks. Merkel responding to that with words of support. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING: "Contrary to how it is sometimes represented in the British press - this process is moving forward step by step. Sometimes the impression is given that after just a few weeks we should now already be announcing the end. To be clear, I find that absolutely absurd." Talks have stalled largely over how much Britain owes when it leaves the bloc. EU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill. They are expected on Friday (October 20) to set a target of December for London to improve its divorce settlement offer. But in a conciliatory gesture they are also likely to call on their staff to prepare for the next stage of talks. That may be enough for May to stave off calls by several Brexit campaigners back home for her to walk away from the negotiating table.

Bank of America (ABC.N) jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s (AAPL.O) 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks.

Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.

The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

“It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

“Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.”

Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

The S&P and the Dow were on track to post gains for the sixth straight week and the Nasdaq for the fourth straight week.

At 11:14 a.m. ET (1514 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 77.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 23,240.82, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 7.26 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,569.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 22.59 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,627.66.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.89 percent gain in the financial index .SPSY.

PayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.

General Electric (GE.N) shares slipped 3.18 percent after the industrial conglomerate reported a profit miss and slashed its earnings forecast.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) dipped 3.19 percent after the company’s sales narrowly missed estimates.

Celgene (CELG.O) slumped more than 10 percent after the company decided to abandon testing a drug to treat Crohn’s disease.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,672 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,745 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the people of the majority Arab city and surrounding province would decide their own future “within the framework of a decentralized, federal, democratic Syria”.

In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa’s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the SDF pledged “to protect the frontiers of the province against all external threats”, and to hand control to a civil council from the city.

The U.S.-backed SDF, which is led by Kurdish militia fighters and also includes Arabs, captured the Syrian de-facto capital of Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate this week in a decisive defeat for the group that had ruled over millions of people from central Syria to northern Iraq.

In Syria, the fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers.

Kurdish-led authorities in other parts of the north say they want a federal system that would allow regions to rule themselves without central control by the center. They have been moving ahead with plans set it up, despite discouragement from their U.S. allies and strong opposition from both Turkey and the Syrian government in Damascus.

Turkey views the rise of Kurdish power in Syria as a threat to its national security, viewing Kurdish groups in northern Syria as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is fighting a three-decade insurgency in Turkey.

Turkey said on Friday that a huge banner of jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in central Raqqa by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces was proof that Washington had been working with terrorists.

NO PROGRESS TOWARDS PEACE

The Kurdish-led autonomy plans in Syria have advanced as diplomacy has failed to make any progress towards a political solution to the six-year-long war.

Assad, who is fast regaining territory in Syria’s most populous eastern regions with Iranian and Russian military support, has repeatedly said the state will recover all Syria.

Asked about the SDF statement, Ali Haidar, the Syrian government minister responsible for national reconciliation, said Raqqa’s future could only be discussed “as part of the final political structure of the Syrian state”.

The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, has established control over swathes of northern Syria in operations backed by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, mostly avoiding conflict with Russian-backed pro-government forces.

Spokesman Talal Silo reaffirmed the SDF’s plan to hand control of Raqqa to a civil council formed of people from the city, and to hand over internal security to a police force drawn from local recruits.

He called Raqqa’s liberation “the final chapter” of a struggle that began against Islamic State from the town of Kobani some three years ago, though the SDF is still fighting the jihadist group in Deir al-Zor province.

The United States has said it will take the lead in helping to clear rubble and restore basic services to the city.

With Islamic State’s self-declared “caliphate” crumbling in its last remaining Syrian strongholds, Assad’s Russian allies said on Thursday the fight with the jihadist group would soon be over.

President Vladimir Putin expressed hope a new peace conference could be convened, though the Kremlin said on Friday it was too early to discuss the timing or venue for the proposed “congress of the peoples of Syria”.

La división de robo y homicidio de esa policía entrevistó una posible víctima de abuso sexual, dijo el portavoz Kevin Maiberger a Reuters. No se brindó más información sobre quién formuló las acusaciones o dónde habría ocurrido el hecho.

“El sr. Weinstein obviamente no puede hablar sobre acusaciones anónimas, pero él sin lugar a dudas niega acusaciones de sexo no consentido”, dijo la portavoz del productor, Sallie Hofmeister, en una declaración enviada por correo electrónico.

La noticia sigue a acusaciones de varias mujeres publicadas este mes por el diario The New York Times y la revista The New Yorker de que Weinstein acosó o abusó sexualmente de ellas, en incidentes que se remontan hasta la década de 1980.

Reuters no pudo confirmar en forma independiente ninguna de las acusaciones. Weinstein, de 65 años, ha negado haber tenido relaciones sexuales no consentidas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s taciturn central bank governor suddenly has lots to say. Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People’s Bank of China, grabbed headlines by warning on Thursday of a possible “Minsky moment.” His reference to a potential financial and economic crash follows other urgent calls for reform in recent days. The comments seem aimed at burnishing his legacy, as well as trying to ensure a like-minded successor fills his shoes.

Zhou is quiet, even by his profession’s standards, and usually grants interviews only when he needs to calm markets. Yet on Oct. 9, Caijin magazine published a rare interview in which the central banker made a strikingly direct call for a more open capital account. At a panel on Sunday in Washington, D.C., he stressed the need to tackle the country’s $18 trillion in corporate debt. And on Thursday, he talked at length about leverage and financial risks on the sidelines of the Communist Party Congress.

The 69-year-old governor is expected to step down soon and would no doubt like to burnish his legacy as a reformer who has worked to liberalize China’s markets and open them up to foreign investors. His most tangible accomplishment came last year when the International Monetary Fund included the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies, the Special Drawing Right.

His warning might also be an effort to buy some reputational insurance – a case of “I told you so” if a mounting debt burden causes the economy to shudder. In context, his recent speeches are even-handed. But Zhou has been at this game for 15 years. He must know that merely using the term Minsky moment, or saying the country can never have an open economy with a tightly controlled currency, will resound all the more during the most sensitive time of China’s political calendar.

Top officials are in Beijing for the Communist Party Congress, a once-in-five-years gathering where they will likely discuss Zhou’s successor as well as the remit and personnel of bureaucracies overseeing the financial system. The governor’s remarks all but ensure that the case for reform will be top of mind during these closed-door discussions, and might even tip the balance toward someone in his mold succeeding him as governor. If there’s a time for the departing central banker to speak up, this is surely it.

Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August and is being carved up among several buyers. Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) has already agreed to buy large parts of Air Berlin.

The group had set a Friday deadline for exclusive talks to sell up to 25 A320 aircraft to Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) as well as to find a buyer for Air Berlin’s cargo marketing businesses and aircraft maintenance businesses.

Several people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday that family-owned firm Zeitfracht and maintenance group Nayak were together poised to strike a deal to buy the cargo marketing platform and maintenance units.

Lufthansa said on Friday that it may remain a major customer to the maintenance business after it has been sold, which is positive news for any possible buyer.

“If there is a buyer, we will of course try to continue booking capacity at Air Berlin Technik or its successor organisation as much as possible,” Lufthansa board member Thorsten Dirks said.

Dirks, who is also chief executive of Lufthansa’s budget unit Eurowings, said the group had discussed the matter with parties interested in the maintenance business as well as with Air Berlin’s administrator.

The maintenance unit has around 850 full-time equivalent positions, or around 1,200 staff.

MUNICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - BMW’s (BMWG.DE) headquarters were raided by European Union officials investigating an alleged cartel among German carmakers, it said on Friday, as rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE) claimed whistleblower status in an effort to avoid fines.

EU staff had “conducted an inspection” at BMW’s Munich offices this week, the premium carmaker said in a statement, adding that it is “assisting the European Commission in its work”.

The EU’s Brussels executive said its antitrust officials had swooped unannounced on “a carmaker in Germany” on Monday Oct. 16 in the first confirmed raid related to allegations that several German automakers had engaged in an illegal cartel.

The competition watchdog said in July that it was investigating collusion among German carmakers in response to a tip-off after Der Spiegel magazine reported that Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its Audi and Porsche arms conspired to fix prices in diesel and other technologies over decades.

“The BMW Group wishes to make clear the distinction between potential violations of antitrust law on the one hand and illegal manipulation of exhaust gas treatment on the other,” the company said. “The BMW Group has not been accused of the latter.”

Brussels has yet to initiate formal antitrust proceedings against any of the carmakers.

However, the allegations have begun to spawn U.S. lawsuits, adding to strains on an industry already struggling with the reputational fallout from widespread diesel emissions-test manipulation exposed in the wake of VW’s dieselgate scandal.

Daimler said on Friday that it had “filed an application for immunity from fines with the European Commission some time ago”, effectively claiming to have blown the whistle on what Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber described as “possible antitrust agreements” with rival manufacturers.

Daimler sees no need to set aside any funds for possible antitrust fines, Uebber added.

To gain immunity, the EU’s antitrust website says, a company that participated in a cartel must be the first to inform the Commission of an undetected cartel by providing sufficient information to justify inspections.

The Commission has declined to identify the original source of the tip-off, saying this is to avoid compromising its investigation.

“Daimler is cooperating with the Commission under its leniency programme,” an EU representative said on Friday.

Volkswagen could also benefit from leniency after sharing information, according to earlier reports. Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.

VW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.

SAN FRANCISCO, 20 oct (Reuters) - Casi dos decenas de firmas importantes de tecnología y otras industrias planean lanzar un grupo para buscar una legislación que ofrezca una vía a la residencia permanente a quienes llegaron a Estados Unidos de manera ilegal durante su infancia, según documentos a los que Reuters tuvo acceso.

La Coalición por el Sueño Americano planea pedirle al Congreso que apruebe una legislación bipartidista este año que permita a estos inmigrantes, llamados “Dreamers”, continuar trabajando en Estados Unidos, dijeron los documentos.

Alphabet Inc -una unidad de Google-, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc, IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc y otras compañías importantes de Estados Unidos figuran como miembros del grupo, muestra uno de los documentos.

Intel, Uber y Univision Communications Inc confirmaron su membresía, pero las otras compañías no hicieron comentarios al respecto. Es posible que los planes para lanzar el grupo puedan cambiar.

“Nos complace unirnos con otras organizaciones para instar al Congreso a aprobar una legislación para proteger a los Dreamers”, dijo el portavoz de Intel, Will Moss, en un comunicado.

Matthew Wing, un portavoz de Uber, declaró: “Uber se unió a la Coalición por el Sueño Americano porque estamos junto a los Dreamers”.

La iniciativa a favor de esta legislación viene después de que el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, puso fin el mes pasado al programa conocido como Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA, por su sigla en inglés) y dio al Congreso seis meses para hallar una solución.

DACA, que comenzó en 2012 con el presidente Barack Obama, ofreció a casi 800.000 jóvenes -que llegaron ilegalmente al país siendo niños- protección ante la posibilidad de ser deportados y el derecho a trabajar.

The vote in the European Parliament’s civil liberties committee was hailed as a step forward by privacy activists but heavily criticized by industry for being too restrictive and inconsistent with a separate data protection regulation.

Under the reworked “ePrivacy” proposal, telecoms operators and internet players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of the customers’ communications and ask for users’ consent before tracking them online to serve them personalized ads.

The rules aim to provide a level playing field between telecoms firms and online players such as WhatsApp, Google and Skype. Currently only telecoms companies are subject to the ePrivacy law.

MEPs strengthened the privacy protections in the original European Commission proposal by requiring web browsers to have their default settings as not allowing personalized online advertising based on browsing habits. Instead, users will be asked to opt in to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers.

Cookies are placed on web surfers’ computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users.

Websites will also be forbidden from preventing users from accessing their content if they do not consent to being tracked, a measure that was criticized by online advertisers as forcing websites to offer content for free.

“News and other online services rely on data-driven, ad-funded business models to finance the creation of content,” said Townsend Feehan, CEO of IAB Europe, the industry association of online advertisers.

“Content that must be given away for nothing will ultimately end up being worth nothing.”

Thursday’s deal is not final as the Parliament will need to find a compromise with member states, who are still divided on the issue.

Additionally, MEPs from the largest center-right group in the Brussels-based legislature voted against the proposal, saying it was weighted too heavily for privacy, restricting digital innovation.

However, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the vote in the parliamentary committee.

“Consumers should not be forced to give up their privacy when they visit a website, send an email or purchase something online,” said Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC.

“It’s alarming that the online companies who claim to be the trend-setters and the engine of the digital economy cling to an advertising business model based on snooping on people.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks climbed, along with the U.S. dollar and bond yields on Friday, as investors anticipated President Donald Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint that paves the way for tax cuts.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY - expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies - up 1.0 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

But gains were curbed by declines in healthcare .SPXHC stocks, off 0.1 percent, and General Electric (GE.N), which lost 2.10 percent after its third-quarter results and forecast cut.

“Investors need to see more than some progress, investors need to see a higher degree of certainty that there is a tradeable narrative underpinning the market,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.

“Investors are only willing to put so much capital at risk with the assumption that better days are ahead when it comes to tax reform.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.13 points, or 0.45 percent, to 23,267.17, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,570.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.74 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,630.80.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.7 percent to $1.1767.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.01 percent and was edging towards record highs.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.3899 percent, from 2.321 percent late on Thursday.

The increased risk appetite also sent gold lower. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.8 percent to $1,279.25 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.71 percent to $1,280.80 an ounce.

U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.19 percent to $51.61 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.51, up 0.49 percent on the day. Still, oil was set for a weekly loss as investors sought to book profit, despite tensions in the Middle East that have slashed supplies of crude.

India woke up to roads littered with layers of firecracker waste on Friday (October 20), a day after celebration of Diwali- Hindu festival of lights. Diwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India's majority Hindu community. The scene in New Delhi looked no different from the previous years despite the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers early this month to prevent a repeat of severe pollution levels that left the capital choking. However, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers. A local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions. Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years. Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.

NUEVA YORK (Reuters) - El ascenso de Jewel en el mundo de la música desde la inhóspita Alaska hasta el estrellato es grande: una chica que soporta un entorno abusivo, se queda en la calle, y luego no sólo sobrevive sino que alcanza la cumbre de su profesión.

Jewel, de 43 años y cuyo nombre es Jewel Kilcher, utilizó herramientas de la práctica de “mindfulness” para sobrevivir a una dura infancia. Jewel compartió algunas de sus experiencias para la serie de Reuters “Lecciones de Vida”.

Pregunta: ¿Quién te transmitía lecciones de vida allá en Alaska?

Respuesta: La naturaleza, los libros, y el dolor. Mi mamá se fue cuando yo tenía ocho años y mi papá se encargó de criar tres niños, y era un alcohólico abusador. En Alaska con frecuencia te cría la naturaleza. Te enseña a cómo ser humano.

En ese tipo de ambiente extremo, uno no se alimenta a menos que mate o conserve algo. Así que hay mucho que superar, pero también te enseña que si trabajas duro y te centras, puedes hacer cualquier cosa.

P: ¿Qué te enseñó el dormir en tu coche sobre el dinero y la supervivencia?

R: La mayoría de la gente piensa que ese período se debió a que perseguía mi sueño de una carrera musical, pero eso no es del todo cierto. Mi jefe me hizo una propuesta de carácter sexual y como lo rechacé, me echó. Por eso viví un par de meses en mi coche, pero luego me lo robaron. Enfermé, me dieron ataques de pánico, casi morí de septicemia. En ese momento fue cuando comencé a robar mucho.

Cuando tenía 18 años y estaba en la calle, vi mi reflejo en un espejo y supe que me había convertido en una estadística. En ese momento decidí cambiar mi vida en base a una sentencia de Buda: la felicidad no depende de quién seas o qué tengas, depende de lo que pienses.

P: ¿Cómo fue pasar de esa vida a una de éxito y riqueza como músico?

R: Casi no firmé el contrato con la discográfica porque estaba asustada. Rechacé un bono de un millón de dólares. Aunque acepté una parte al final en caso de que la discográfica terminara ganando dinero.

P: ¿Cómo estás transformando este interés en el “mindfulness” en un negocio?

R: La web (jewelneverbroken.com) es sin ánimo de lucro y gratis para todo el mundo. Es un lugar para la salud emocional, donde las personas pueden acceder a simples herramientas de “mindfulness” para crear un cambio en su vida.

Como madre, no quería depender totalmente de las giras para vivir. Aún quería hacer música pero también quería ayudar a las personas con su dolor de otras maneras.

Así que una parte de mi negocio será B2B, trabajar con Zappos.com para crear la próxima frontera de la cultura corporativa. Otro aspecto será la educación, sobre cómo las personas pueden alcanzar un buen estado emocional, la crianza de sus hijos y las finanzas. También estoy creando un programa para estudiantes con “mindfulness” incluido, para que los chicos con adicciones o ansiedad puedan convertirse en los arquitectos de su propia vida.

P: ¿Cómo decides a qué destinar tu dinero?

R: Fundé Project Clean Water en 1997, porque cuando estuve en la calle no podía comprar agua embotellada. Si no podemos tomar nuestra agua del grifo, tenemos un problema. También fundé Never Broken Foundation para ayudar a las personas a alcanzar una buena salud emocional.

P: Como madre soltera de un niño de 6 años, ¿qué consejo le darías a otros padres solteros sobre cómo prosperar emocional y económicamente?

R: Uno tiene que desprenderse del mito del perfeccionismo. Los padres solteros siempre se sienten como un fracaso si están trabajando y criando un niño al mismo tiempo. Pero uno no es un fracaso, y no tiene que hacer las cosas perfectas. Hay que recordar que los niños nos están viendo, y está bien que vean los errores. Esto es la vida real y todos respondemos en tiempo real.

TOKYO (Reuters) - For Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, Sunday’s general election has brought into focus the challenge of unwinding a massive stimulus program and yield curve control policy, while not hurting a budding but still fragile economy, the world’s third-largest.

With inflation far below a 2 percent target, the BOJ rules out any near-term exit from Kuroda’s legacy ultra-easy policy.

But there’s growing alarm within the central bank about how long it can keep the money spigot open, given the rising costs and diminishing returns, people familiar with BOJ thinking say.

Most of the BOJ’s nine board members and bureaucrats involved in drafting monetary policy feel the next step - though some way off - would be to roll back Kuroda’s radical monetary experiment, with the economy in recovery-mode, they say.

The political tide is shifting in favor of at least having such a debate.

Several ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) heavyweights have warned of the rising cost of prolonged monetary easing. Opposition parties, including the new Party of Hope led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, want a departure from over-reliance on monetary policy.

“The BOJ may be asked to explain more in parliament how it intends to exit,” said one of the people familiar with BOJ thinking. “That would require some changes in communication.”

BOJ bureaucrats are drafting a plan. The trick is to retreat from crisis-mode stimulus without giving the impression the bank is embarking on outright monetary tightening.

Already, the BOJ is proceeding with the first stage of the plan - by whittling down its vast bond purchases to an annual pace of around 50 trillion yen ($443 billion), below a loose pledge to keep it at around 80 trillion yen.

The next step would be to allow long-term interest rates, which the BOJ has capped at around zero, to rise, more reflecting improvements in the economy, the sources say. The bank could raise the bond yield target or shift it to the shorter end of the curve even before inflation hits 2 percent, as it can maintain easy monetary conditions with its strong balance sheet.

“If long-term rates rise naturally, reflecting improvements in the economy, the BOJ may not need to cap 10-year yields at zero,” one of the people said. It could then raise short-term rates, though reducing the size of its balance sheet could be years away.

LEARNING FROM THE FED

After a massive asset-buying program that Kuroda deployed in 2013 failed to fire up inflation, the BOJ reverted last September to a policy targeting interest rates.

Since then, the bank has begun to more openly debate an exit.

Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso said the BOJ can learn from the U.S. Federal Reserve when withdrawing stimulus, while another deputy governor said the BOJ is conducting exit simulations.

Kuroda concedes that meeting the inflation goal will take time as shocking the public out of deflation proved tough - a sea change from his 2013 pledge the target could be met in just two years.

Gone, too, are his threats to ramp up stimulus to reach his price target sooner.

Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the shift to yield curve control a year ago was a normalization of monetary policy in a narrow sense.

“Everybody says nowadays that a central bank’s goal is price stability or stable low-rate inflation. But what we really care about is people’s well being,” he said. “I don’t think (the BOJ) needs to add stimulus.”

COST OF DELAY

Delaying an exit from the ultra-loose policy could be costly.

FILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo

As the U.S. Fed and the European Central Bank begin to roll back post-financial crisis unconventional policies, the divergence could trigger market turbulence.

Bound by near-zero rates, the BOJ could be left with fewer tools than its peers to battle another recession.

“The BOJ needs to start normalizing policy, at least from 2018, when the economy is still in good shape,” said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research and a veteran BOJ watcher. “Otherwise, it will lose the window of opportunity to exit.”

Prolonged easing could also destabilize the banking system by eroding bank profits, a warning the International Monetary Fund made in a report this month.

Still, finding the way out from years of heavy money printing isn’t easy. Any sign of diminishing BOJ presence may jolt the bond market, which saw liquidity dwindle as the bank gobbled up roughly 40 percent of the market.

Stocks are also heavily reliant on the BOJ buying exchange-traded funds, so any slowdown in that could hit stock prices and business sentiment.

And there’s the question of who will next be leading the BOJ.

If Prime Minister Shinzo Abe holds on to power, there’s a good chance he would reappoint Kuroda for another term, analysts say. He’d still have to heed growing calls for more debate on an exit strategy.

Seiko Noda, a cabinet minister seen as Abe’s leadership rival, has called for scrutiny on the rising cost of prolonged easy policy. And Abe himself no longer calls on the BOJ to do whatever it takes to achieve 2 percent inflation, saying only he hopes the bank will “keep up efforts” to end deflation.

“The biggest flaw of the BOJ’s current framework is the difficulty of an exit,” said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official and now chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

“The BOJ has kept mum on this, but it may change that stance if the political sentiment begins to shift.”

President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his "America first" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s descent into political crisis just days before Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence among business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”

Earlier this week BoE Governor Mark Carney said the lack of women in senior positions was “an issue” for the Bank and that it had taken extensive action to correct this.

However, it is the finance ministry that appoints people to the BoE’s monetary, financial and prudential regulation policy committees.

“The Treasury must make all efforts to encourage as diverse range of candidates for the Bank’s policy committees as possible,” said lawmaker Nicky Morgan, chair of parliament’s Treasury Committee.

She added that the finance ministry has been asked to confirm that its recruitment processes fit with a remit of achieving greater diversity of public appointments, including from ethnic minorities.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - A campaign by leading Arab powers to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepening fears of a possible jolt to the global gas market, where the tiny Gulf state is a major player.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.

Speaking at a conference in New York, Powell said the U.S. central bank would early next year launch a study analyzing payment security vulnerabilities and also planned to create new working groups focused on reducing the industry costs associated with securing payments.

“Rapidly changing technology is providing a historic opportunity to transform our daily lives, including the way we pay. Fintech firms and banks are embracing this change, as they strive to address consumer demands for more timely and convenient payments,” said Powell.

“It is essential, however, that this innovation not come at the cost of a safe and secure payment system that retains the confidence of its end users.”

The Fed does not have complete authority over the U.S. payment system, but it has led industry efforts to make it faster and easier to use. The central bank also leads the 160-member Secure Payments Task Force.

Powell’s comments underline growing concerns among financial market participants and regulators about the risks cyber thieves pose to the financial system following a series of recent incidents.

Last year, SWIFT, the global financial messaging system, disclosed it had suffered hacking attacks on its member banks including the high-profile $81 million heist at Bangladesh Bank.

During that incident, hackers broke into the computers of Bangladesh’s central bank and sent fake payment orders, tricking the Federal Reserve Bank of New York into transferring the funds. [here]

Powell said on Wednesday new fintech payment companies posed “significant challenges to traditional banking business models” and that the payment system was reaching a “critical juncture.”

His comments echoed those of Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley who on Saturday warned payments would be the next battleground for banks amid increasing competition from fintech players and tech giants including Amazon and Facebook.

The FTSE 100, which hit a record level last week, was on track for a slight weekly loss after four weeks of robust gains, bruised by sharp drops earlier in the week from Convatec (CTEC.L) and Merlin (MERL.L).

British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled talks with the European Union as EU leaders said they would begin preparations to move into the second phase of Brexit talks in December.

The pound strengthened to 89.295 pence per euro EURGBP=D3, having earlier dipped to its weakest since Oct. 12. That left it up 0.8 percent on the day.

Unilever (ULVR.L) and Reckitt (RB.L) were among the leading decliners after weak results earlier this week, closing down 3.2 and 2.7 percent respectively.

“When companies disappoint they’re getting properly spanked. In the big stocks Unilever has been particularly weak after results. The market is in an unforgiving mood,” said Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton Group.

Miner Fresnillo (FRES.L) was the top FTSE 100 loser, closing 3.6 percent lower, after a downgrade to “neutral” from top-ranked Credit Suisse analyst Ivano Westin on the grounds that it was now well-priced.

Like fellow miners Antofagasta (ANTO.L), Glencore (GLEN.L) and Rio Tinto (RIO.L), it has been lifted by London copper prices, on track for their fourth weekly gain and fresh from three-year highs.

Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and RSA Insurance (RSA.L) were among the biggest boosts to the index, up 3.1 and 2.4 percent, after the U.S. Senate passed a budget blueprint seen as a key step towards tax cuts that the market hopes will aid financials.

Mid-caps .FTMC closed up 0.1 percent, recovering from their worst day in a month when workspace group IWG (IWG.L) slumped 34 percent after results. The FTSE 250 hit a record close on Wednesday.

“It’s quite surprising how well the FTSE 250 has held up since the referendum,” said Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at Kiillik & Co. “If I were a company exposed just to the UK I would not be investing and expanding at the moment.”

“Most UK fund managers are overweight the mid-caps, so if we do see a lot of profit warnings we might see them re-assessing how much they want to hold companies there,” she added.

Shares in Acacia Mining (ACAA.L) fell back 8.1 percent after third-quarter earnings came in below consensus estimates.

The gold miner had soared 16 percent on Thursday after its owner Barrick Gold (ABX.TO) struck a deal with the Tanzanian government to settle a tax dispute. But Acacia said on Friday it would need to approve the deal and was seeking further clarification.

“We expect quarterly earnings to be largely looked through as investors focus on gaining more clarity following yesterday’s announcements,” said Jefferies analysts.

Small-cap Interserve (IRV.L), which also plummeted on Thursday after a profit warning, jumped back 16.8 percent after the support services firm won a 227 million pound contract with the British government.

Overall analysts have downgraded their earnings expectations for the FTSE 100 into third-quarter results as a boost from sterling’s depreciation fades.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Not for the first time, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is facing a tricky balancing act.

With the euro zone economic recovery well into its fifth year, the time has come to cut stimulus. Yet, overly ambitious tightening could choke off the very growth Draghi has fostered, threatening to undo years of work.

Draghi also has to find common ground between policy hawks, who argue the ECB has spent its firepower so any further stimulus has negligible effect, and doves, who point to persistently weak inflation as evidence the bank has not met its price-stability mandate.

The compromise is likely to be a cut in bond purchases at Thursday’s policy meeting, twinned with a lengthy extension of stimulus and a commitment to keep rates low for many years to come.

Such a move would ensure that easy policy persists while also reducing the ECB’s reliance on unconventional tools and potentially paving the way to exit bond purchases.

The problem is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, unemployment remains high, wage growth is barely visible and inflation will probably not rise back to the ECB’s target before the end of the decade.

The bond purchases have depressed borrowing costs but the ECB is slowly running out of debt to buy so it either takes a step toward the exit or redraws the rules of the program, a potentially controversial move that may send the wrong signal.

A Reuters poll of economists concluded the ECB Central Bank it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to 40 billion euros from 60 billion euros in January.

It was mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.

Sources close to the ECB’s pre-meeting discussions say the a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between 25 and 40 billion euros a month.

But the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.

While this debate is still open, sources speaking to Reuters said it is more likely the bank would maintain the flexibility and even signal a willingness to increase asset buys if the outlook sours.

That, says UBS, is crucial: “We view the duration of the extension in net asset purchases as more important than the monthly size in ensuring the ECB’s ability to manage the expectations around its future policy.”

New bond purchases will add little to inflation. But they will buy the ECB some time as it waits for growth to finally translate into inflation.

In a glimmer of hope for policymakers, Germany’s largest trade union recently asked for a 6 percent wage hike for nearly 4 million workers, an ambitious move, which could lift wages across the board as many employee groups look to IG Metall to set the trend.

Euro zone inflation - currently at 1.5 percent - remains well below the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent and expectations are for it to stay that way at least until 2019.

HURRICANES

While the euro zone enjoys its growth run, the United States, the world’s biggest economy, probably suffered a major hit last quarter, mostly due to the disruptions from hurricanes.

An advance release of third quarter data at the end of the coming week is likely to show growth slowing to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent with a decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Rebuilding efforts are, however, expected to boost GDP growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2018, suggesting that the dip is temporary and will be mostly compensated for in the coming quarters.

“Damages from the hurricanes will likely total around $150 billion, with an unusually large portion of that coming from business interruption to refineries, petrochemical plants, restaurants and residential construction,” Wells Fargo said, predicting that hurricanes shaved about 0.9 percentage points off Q3 growth.

But economists added that if the weather distortions fade quickly, the U.S. Federal Reserve would remain on course to hike rates before the end of the year, given that the economy is essentially at full employment.

A compromise on a tax reform package and a growth rebound could also solidify expectations for two more hikes next year, analysts added.

Paris wants to regulate Asian bike-share operators

Launched just last week, Hong Kong’s Gobee.bike has already spread its bikes all over Paris and Chinese giants Ofo and Mobike, as well as Singapore startup oBike, see entering the French capital as a key step in their plans to conquer Europe’s city centers.

Armed with hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, the Asian bike-sharing firms, which have revolutionized urban transport in China, have already launched their colorful dockless bikes in a string of European cities like Milan and London, some with local authority blessing, some not.

Some cities fear that the uncontrolled introduction of thousands of bicycles will bring chaos on roads and sidewalks, as has happened in China. Dockless bikes can be found and unlocked with mobile apps and parked anywhere.

Paris deputy mayor for urban planning Jean-Louis Missika, told Reuters the city wants to control the bike schemes and does not want to see them to break into an unregulated Paris market the way U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber and short-term rental firm Airbnb have in recent years.

“We will ask the government to give the city the power to regulate under the form of a license,” Missika said on the sidelines of urban mobility conference Autonomy.

He added that bike share operators will have to respect rules about using public space and may have to pay a license.

“We do not have the required regulatory framework, just like it was with Airbnb ... and Uber before legislators created a license,” Missika said.

In July, Paris made it mandatory for apartments rented through Airbnb to be registered.

Missika said Paris is in favor of bike-sharing, which it has pioneered with its dock-based Velib scheme, but added he was not too happy with the way Gobee.bike had started operations.

“They saw a gap in the regulation and they jumped in. We cannot blame them, but that does not mean we will leave it at that,” he said.

Ofo - which operates 10 million bikes in China and has launched thousands in Milan, Vienna, Valencia and London - told Reuters last week it plans to launch its bikes in Paris around year-end.

Missika said several operators have contacted the city to discuss introducing their bike schemes, including Ofo’s big Chinese competitor Mobike.

Singapore startup oBike, which has launched its bikes in London, Munich, Madrid and Zurich, already has a team in Paris.

“We hope to get bikes on the ground in Paris in the next few weeks,” oBike’s Amber Huang told Reuters. The company has also started talks with several other French cities including Avignon, Marseilles and Strasbourg.

Last month, Brussels mobility minister Pascal Smet said oBike had launched there without contacting regional authorities and said he was looking into establishing a legal framework.

“We’d be happy to work with local authorities,” Huang said.

Florian Bohnert, head of global partnerships at Shanghai-based Mobike, declined to comment on the firm’s plans for Paris and Europe but said the firm always negotiates with local governments before launch.

“Some other players tend to act first and talk later, put 500 bikes in a city, have a press announcement, then a few months later their bikes are being impounded,” he said.

Mobike operates 7 million bikes worldwide, mostly in China. In May, it raised $600 million from China’s Internet giant Tencent Holdings and several private equity firms, which will be partly used for foreign expansion.

In recent months it has launched thousands of bikes in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Japan’s Sapporo and Fukuoka, in Washington DC and in Europe it has launched in London, Manchester and Newcastle, in Milan and Florence.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen major companies in technology and other industries are planning to launch a coalition to demand legislation that would allow young, illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The Coalition for the American Dream intends to ask Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “Dreamers,” to continue working in the United States, the documents said.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows.

Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

“We’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,” Intel spokesman Will Moss said in a statement.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

Many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.

“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview earlier on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.

“You will see this continue to escalate until the end of the year,” he said.

Former journalist Devashish Makhija makes short films, writes children's books and has written the script for several movies. His latest full-length feature, "Ajji" (Grandmother), is the dark tale of an old woman who sets out to avenge the rape of her granddaughter.

Makhija tells Reuters why “Ajji” is about urban privilege and how the making of the film took a toll on his health.

Q: One of the big themes that emerge out of “Ajji” is urban privilege. Why was that important?

A: I don’t know if you have seen my short films, but I do this in all my stories. Not only because I feel guilty being born into a middle-class family and having three meals a day, but because I have actively travelled in tribal areas. When I came to Mumbai, I stayed in a slum for the first two years. I have actively tried to understand inequality, because inequality manifests in injustice. The law, though it says it is equal for all, everyone cannot access it. In all my stories, I try to remind those who have a little privilege that you are having it easy and there is someone out there who is not.

Q: How did you end up living in a slum?

A: I am from Calcutta. I was a journalist for a bit, in advertising for a bit, and I just couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do. I had a few friends who knew videography and they said, “Come here”. I came to Mumbai and lived in a slum rehabilitation colony. I didn’t have a choice – I didn’t have too much money. My mum had just passed and I had walked away from life as I knew it. Living there, I started questioning my life as it had been up until then.

The first film I worked on was "Black Friday". Even during the research of that film, we worked in the ghettos like Behrampada, Navpada. We lived in those areas for days and that just set me on a journey I couldn’t turn back from. I have taken it upon myself to put these people in all my stories - to tell stories about them because they are not represented in the mainstream.

I could have made “Ajji” more arthouse than it actually is. But somewhere in its story-telling, I tried to make it accessible. I tried to keep the thrill and drama going because I want the mainstream to watch it so that they will think about the other sections of society.

Q: What have you learned about the “other sections”?

Handout still from the movie "Ajji"

A: There’s nothing that I learned from them. The more time I spend in strata and milieus that I don’t belong to, the more I learn about us. The fact that we take too much for granted. We feel wronged about being shortchanged while buying a pair of shoes. And over there is a grandmother whose granddaughter had her life taken from her as she knew it. She will never be the same again. That level of shortchange doesn’t compare to this. There is such a dichotomy and we understand life at such a different level... we operate at such a different frequency.

Q: Does it frustrate you as a film-maker that we don’t see too many of these subjects in the mainstream?

A: No, it doesn’t. And I try and not be arrogant about it. This film, even though it was made at a frighteningly low budget of 1.2 crores (12 million rupees), is still one point two crores, the kind of money I will never see at one go in my lifetime. And I am using someone else’s money to make my film. If someone is giving you money, they don’t want you to hold a mirror to them. They want to escape somewhere else. I get that and I have no sour grapes about that.

Q: How did you come up with the character of Ajji, the protagonist in your film?

A: Ajji was a response to a lot of things, (like) the constant reportage of rape after Nirbhaya. After a point, the film goes beyond rape and revenge. It is about all these inequalities. I had an idea about the most unlikely candidate in a family who would go out and do something about this. And the answer was the grandmother. And we made it even harder for her – we gave her arthritis, we made her live in a milieu where the patriarchy is so systemic that you don’t even realise it’s there until something gets out of hand. The truth of rape-revenge is so universal that I knew that if I make it dramatic enough, I’ll have the audience. The question was - how do I throw in all the other things that I wanted to talk about. That is how Ajji emerged.

Q: Your villain is completely despicable. Did he have to be that way for the film to work?

A: That’s a fair question. But like I said, in that milieu, the patriarchy is 5,000 years old. I was trying to distill that thought process into a person. Dhawale is not a person, but a thought process, and because it is so powerful, he had to be that way.

Q: You said that the making of the film affected your health.

A: (Pauses). I finally feel ready to talk about it. All of last year, during the making of the film, I started hating on my own masculinity. I was in prep in September last year when I started urinating blood. I was in severe pain and thought I wouldn’t be able to shoot. A doctor at the Hinduja Hospital thought it was prostate cancer. I shot on medication and as I went into post-production, I started healing myself. I met a few alternate healers who told me that I was hating on my own masculinity and the prostate gland is really the seat of the male hormone. In retrospect, I think in the making of the film, I sort of went through what Manda (the granddaughter) did. I could feel what Manda was feeling, what Ajji was feeling, because I was in so much pain, and it probably manifested on screen.

Ushered in with a bang, the annual Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, kicking off on Thursday (October 19). But as people across India let off fireworks for the celebration, there were fewer to be seen in and around Delhi. The supreme court has put a temporary ban on the sale of crackers in the capital, because officials are worried they could send already high pollution levels skyrocketing. Air quality began worsening in the city ahead of the festival this week prompting the government to order diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down. While emergency services like hospitals are exempt, many well-off residents are now running on back up generators. The measures will stay in place until March to prevent pollution levels from rising further. Choking smog in Delhi has become a major public policy issue in the past few years as residents become more aware of the life-threatening effects of breathing dirty air which is often ranked among the world's most toxic.

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalise a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of messaging app Snapchat, is down more than 10 percent from its IPO price in March.

SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.
In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.
Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.
Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.
That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan soldiers and police brought to the United States for training go “absent without leave” at far higher rates than those of any other country, potentially imperilling efforts to assist Afghan security forces, a U.S. watchdog said on Friday.

Of the 320 foreign military trainees who left while on courses in the United States from 2005 to 2017, 152 - or more than 47 percent - were Afghans, said a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).

The State Department called that number “unacceptably high”. SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.

In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.

That’s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.

“The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,” it concluded.

Only 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.

Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.

Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.

In response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend.

That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away. “If a student absconds, it affects his unit,” one Afghan officer told investigators.

Between 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.

>> Hospitals across America are facing a dire shortage of nurses, forcing them to find new ways of attracting and retaining staff. Nursing shortages have occurred before, but the current crisis is worse. Reuters' health reporter, Jilian Mincer.>> Many hospitals are offering $10,000 signing bonuses, free housing, and they're repaying students loans.

This is coming at a very difficult time for hospitals because as Americans age, there's greater demand for hospitals. There are also more Americans insured as a result of the Affordable Care Act.>> 40-year-old Christine Marasco works at JW Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia, even though she lives two hours away.

To make easier on Marasco, the hospital puts her up in a dorm across the street.>> I do leave a husband and four children to come work at WVU Medicine and there's a very good reason for that. The benefits package, compensation, there was a very handsome sign-on bonus at the time.

And the big thing for me was that the company was able to provide housing for me while I was here at no additional charge to me. So it made it almost irresistable. How could I not come?

Hospitals that can't afford to attract nurses face a difficult choice between risking patient safety or closing down departments.

Doug Mitchell, a career nurse with 30 years under his belt, says this latest nursing shortage is alarming.>> When we're 98% occupied and there's a nursing shortage, that's difficult. If a nurse decides, I don't like it here, he or she can walk across the street. They could be working tomorrow morning.

It's definitely a seller's market. So as a buyer, we have to make it so this is an attractive place for nurses to come and work and do a great job.>> To fill the void, many hospitals are also bringing on short-term hires, known as travel nurses, who are stationed at a hospital for 13 to 26 weeks at a time.

It's been 17 years since Pullman released "The Amber Spyglass", the last book in his globally-acclaimed "His Dark Materials" trilogy.
But now he has returned to the realm of alethiometers, daemons and windows into other worlds with "La Belle Sauvage" - and that's given some people cause to celebrate.
Seventeen years worth of anticipation means "La Belle Sauvage" is likely to be one this year's biggest sellers.
It's got our largest presale figures since 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' which was our biggest presale and our biggest seller last year, of any book.
I wouldn't be surprised if 'La Belle Sauvage' was our biggest seller this year and potentially Christmas number one."

The wait is over for millions of Philip Pullman fans. The first novel in the new "Book of Dust" trilogy, hitting bookshops on Thursday (October 19). It's been 17 years since Pullman released "The Amber Spyglass", the last book in his globally-acclaimed "His Dark Materials" trilogy. But now he has returned to the realm of alethiometers, daemons and windows into other worlds with "La Belle Sauvage" - and that's given some people cause to celebrate. Take for example this midnight party at the Waterstones store on London's Tottenham Court Road, one of hundreds of events being held in shops across the UK. The 150 guests here treated to themed cocktails, food and readings - and a chance to be among the first to get their hands on the new book. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JACK TINDALE, WATERSTONES CUSTOMER, SAYING: "I remember reading this when I was a young teenager, sort of 11, 12 years old, and very strangely you just come along and you feel giddy and like you are a teenager again. It's very strange." Seventeen years worth of anticipation means "La Belle Sauvage" is likely to be one this year's biggest sellers. Early on Thursday morning it was topping Amazon's bestseller charts, and Waterstones is expecting big sales too. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ALICE CHAPPELL, WATERSTONES BOOKSELLER, SAYING: "This book is hotly anticipated. It's got our largest presale figures since 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' which was our biggest presale and our biggest seller last year, of any book. I wouldn't be surprised if 'La Belle Sauvage' was our biggest seller this year and potentially Christmas number one." Those expectations are not surprising. "His Dark Materials" sold more than 17 million copies in 40 languages worldwide. Once the dust settles, this may well be 2017's literary belle of the ball.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O governo federal vai prever no orçamento da União de 2018 uma arrecadação de 7,7 bilhões de reais com o processo de privatização da Eletrobras, disse nesta sexta-feira o ministro interino de Minas e Energia, Paulo Pedrosa, ao participar de debate sobre a estatal na Federação das Indústrias do Estado de São Paulo (Fiesp).

O dinheiro entrará para o Tesouro com o pagamento pela Eletrobras de um bônus em troca de contratos mais vantajosos para suas hidrelétricas. A estatal deverá obter o dinheiro para o pagamento com uma oferta de ações que reduzirá a União a uma fatia minoritária na companhia.

Os recursos de privatizações devem ajudar o governo federal a tentar cumprir suas metas orçamentárias.

Pedrosa disse ainda que os planos para a privatização preveem também limites à participação de investidores na Eletrobras.

“Estamos investindo (na ideia de privatização) para trazer resultado e criar uma corporação... com uma limitação, em que nenhum acionista tenha mais de 10 por cento do bloco de controle, uma empresa com lógica privada”, disse Pedrosa.

O diretor-geral da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), Romeu Rufino, também presente no debate, disse que para o órgão regulador é indiferente se uma empresa como a Eletrobras tem controle estatal ou privado, mas ressaltou que ineficiências da companhia nos últimos anos têm punido os consumidores com custos mais elevados.

Ele deu como exemplos o atraso na entrega de obras devido à crise financeira enfrentada pela empresa.

“O grupo Eletrobras assumiu compromissos que não conseguiu entregar, por várias dificuldades. Tanto no segmento de transmissão quanto no de geração, convivemos com atrasos que não foram indiferentes para o setor como um todo, principalmente para o consumidor. Afetou o consumidor de forma significativa... isso não pode continuar”, disse.

Ele também defendeu a venda das distribuidoras de eletricidade da Eletrobras como uma questão essencial para a própria sobrevivência dessas empresas, que são responsáveis pelo atendimento a Estados do Norte e Nordeste e enfrentam pesados e recorrentes prejuízos.

Mas o diretor ressaltou que o modelo previsto pelo governo para viabilizar a desestatização da Eletrobras, que prevê uma mudança nos contratos de hidrelétricas antigas da companhia, poderá impactar o consumidor, uma vez que as usinas poderão vender sua produção a preços maiores.

Essas hidrelétricas hoje entregam a energia às distribuidoras por preços muito baixos, em um chamado “regime de cotas”. O processo de mudança nos contratos desses empreendimentos tem sido chamado de “descotização”.

Rufino defendeu que o governo precisa ter cuidado nesse processo para evitar uma forte elevação das tarifas.

“A descotização, isoladamente, não vai na direção da modicidade tarifária. A privatização da Eletrobras, se tem um ganho de eficiência, então ela vai nesse sentido, sim. Uma coisa compensa a outra? Não sei.”

Para o ex-diretor da Aneel Edvaldo Santana, agora presidente da Abrace, associação que representa grandes indústrias, a Eletrobras nos últimos anos passou a assumir diversos custos que depois acabaram sendo repassado aos consumidores.

“Independentemente do problema ideológico, a privatização da Eletrobras é um problema de custo. Ela se tornou uma agregadora de custos... a privatização, com a descotização, aumenta a tarifa... mas os ganhos compensam tudo isso, não precisa fazer nenhuma conta, só de acabar com esse ciclo vicioso de aumento de custos”, afirmou ele, também presente na Fiesp.

O governo tem falado em concluir todo o processo de privatização da elétrica federal até o final do primeiro semestre de 2018.

Donald Trump is approaching a crucial deadline on his Iran policy. On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.

An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said Tillerson had made an important speech on the future of India-U.S. relations and India looked forward to detailed discussions next week.
India warned that China’s plans for a modern-day “Silk Road” could create an “unsustainable debt burden” for countries.
The ministry spokesman said India agreed with Tillerson’s call for a “rules-based” international order that is seen as under risk from China’s assertive posture in Asia.

Tillerson, who is visiting India next week as part of a tour to the region, said in a speech the United States had begun to discuss alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing in Asia that critics say has spawned resentment and fears of a debt trap.

He also called for expanding the scope of security cooperation between India, the United States and Japan to include other countries such as Australia, a plan that China has said in the past would be de-stabilising to the region.

An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said Tillerson had made an important speech on the future of India-U.S. relations and India looked forward to detailed discussions next week.

“We appreciate his positive evaluation of the relationship and share his optimism about its future directions,” the spokesman said.

Tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to Chinese infrastructure financing, which India has also been increasingly concerned about as China seeks to build trade and transport links in Asia.

India was the only major country in Asia not to send a representative to a “Belt and Road Initiative” summit in Beijing in May because an economic corridor that China was building in Pakistan ran through territory claimed by India.

India warned that China’s plans for a modern-day “Silk Road” could create an “unsustainable debt burden” for countries.

The ministry spokesman said India agreed with Tillerson’s call for a “rules-based” international order that is seen as under risk from China’s assertive posture in Asia.

The United States has repeatedly criticised China for disregarding international law with the construction and militarisation of artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea, where neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have claims.

“Tillerson has made a significant policy statement on India-U.S. relations and its future. He brought out its various strengths and highlighted our shared commitment to a rule-based international order,” the Indian spokesman said.

India, though, has been wary of U.S. calls for a bigger Indian military role including joint patrols in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, worried it would antagonise China further.

For the first time in decades, the top floors of the amphitheater built to host gladiatorial contests nearly 2,000 years ago have opened for small groups of visitors. Back in the arena's heyday the poor, women and slaves stood up or sat in the cheapest seats on the top tiers, high up and far from the action. Today, their seats on the newly-renovated fifth floor of the amphitheater offer exclusive views of the interior of the Colosseum as well as the historical sites outside the famed landmark. The fourth level of the Colosseum has also been renovated, along with a hallway leading to the top terraces, and visitors in small groups are now allowed to visit the newly opened areas. According to the General Director of the Colosseum Archeological Park, Federica Galloni, it has been some 40 years since tourists were able to access the top terraces and view the arena from 40 meters (131 feet) above. The Colosseum attracts more than six million visitors a year.

Gilbert Rozon made the announcement on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. He is the latest entertainment executive to be accused of sexual harassment in the wake of accusations against U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“Shaken by the allegations against me, I wish to take time to reflect,” Rozon wrote, adding he was “sincerely sorry” for “all the women and men I may have offended in the course of my life.”

The company confirmed Rozon’s resignation and said an independent board of directors will be put in place. Spokesman Jean-David Pelletier declined to comment further.

Montreal newspaper ‘Le Devoir’ on Thursday reported allegations by nine women who said they had been sexually harassed or abused by Rozon.

Rozon announced his immediate resignation from ‘Just for Laughs’, as well as his departure from the committee organizing events to mark Montreal’s 375th anniversary this year and his role as vice president of the Montreal Board of Trade.

Held every summer in Montreal, ‘Just for Laughs’ is one of the largest international comedy festivals and is a major tourist attraction for the city.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made gender equality a significant part of the government’s focus, said society was “seeing a moment of awakening”.

“It’s unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets and I think people are beginning to get it,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal. “It doesn’t matter how much power you have, how much influence you have, it’s never all right.”

Amazon Studios chief Roy Price also resigned earlier this week following allegations he harassed a producer and took no action when an actress told him she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein.

SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.
In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.
Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.
Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.
That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan soldiers and police brought to the United States for training go “absent without leave” at far higher rates than those of any other country, potentially imperilling efforts to assist Afghan security forces, a U.S. watchdog said on Friday.

Of the 320 foreign military trainees who left while on courses in the United States from 2005 to 2017, 152 - or more than 47 percent - were Afghans, said a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).

The State Department called that number “unacceptably high”. SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.

In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.

That’s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.

“The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,” it concluded.

Only 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.

Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.

Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.

In response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend.

That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away. “If a student absconds, it affects his unit,” one Afghan officer told investigators.

Between 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.

It's been a chaotic week for Kurdish oil fields The Iraqi military took control of the oil-rich Kirkuk area from Kurdish Peshmerga forces this week. (SOUNDBITE) (Arabic) COMMANDER OF 3RD BATTALION EMERGENCY RESPONSE DIVISION, LIEUTENANT COLONEL ATHEER IBRAHIM, SAYING: "This morning we advanced into north oil fields including Bai Hasan north oil field and Bai Hasan south oil field. As you can see order is restored and imposed." And now another twist in the pipeline. Russia's biggest oil company, Rosneft is to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan's main oil pipeline, boosting its investment in the autonomous region to $3.5 billion. Oil prices settled on Friday, having spiked earlier in the week amid fears of violence. SOUNDBITE (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: "Supply has not really been impacted that much yet. It may come. So I really think that really has been the perception of the potential impact that's really been driving this sort of like moves in the market." Russia's move appears to be part of a strategy to boost its Middle Eastern political and economic influence. Rosneft's investment comes as Kurdistan's relations with the central government in Baghdad have hit crisis point. Kurdistan held an independence referendum last month, angering neighbours Iran and Turkey. The U.S. called the referendum a provocation. But Moscow has effectively supported the vote, saying it understood Kurdish aspirations for independence. Rosneft says it would own 60 percent of the pipeline, with current operator KAR Group retaining 40 percent. Baghdad has threatened to re-route a big chunk of oil flows towards an old oil pipeline Although industry experts have said that's unrealistic as the pipeline is rusty and in need of major investment.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Soon after Indonesian President Joko Widodo took office in 2014, he ordered his ministers to give private companies first pick of profitable infrastructure projects, until then usually grabbed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

Three years on, the private sector is estimated to be handling only one in five projects, sparking warnings that the dominance of SOEs is holding back billions of dollars of extra investment that could help fix shoddy infrastructure.

Now, even government insiders are questioning the status quo. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told a World Bank forum this month there was a need to assess whether SOEs were “really efficient in investing in infrastructure.”

“We will look at what kind of dominance, what kind of behavior that is creating the crowding out of the private sector,” Indrawati said.

A failure to get private firms to shoulder a bigger burden is another risk for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy at a time when consumption is sluggish and interest rates have been cut twice in quick succession to spur flatlining growth.

Over 2,600 km of new roads and seven new airports have been built since Widodo took power in October 2014 - near the midpoint of targets for his full tenure, government data shows.Despite missing targets in power, rail, water and housing, an independent survey by the Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that Indonesians were optimistic their president would improve infrastructure. (bit.ly/2gwes5j)

Over-stretched SOEs could be pushed to do yet more.

Four Indonesian state firms are preparing to issue the country’s first rupiah-denominated global bonds, which Widodo has dubbed “komodo bonds”, to raise funds for infrastructure projects. Komodo dragons are giant lizards found only in eastern Indonesia.

SHARE OF THE PIE

Johannes Suriadjaja, chief executive of private construction firm Surya Semesta Internusa (SSIA.JK), said his company tried to win infrastructure work for years without much success.

“It’s difficult because everything is too concentrated at the government or the SOEs,” Suriadjaja said. State groups were prepared to take tenders he could not justify because of low profitability, he said.

Rainier Haryanto, program director of the government’s Committee to Accelerate Priority Infrastructure, disputed this.

“We do things through open tender and the one offering the best price wins. If the private players are not competitive and they don’t win. Don’t blame the government and SOEs,” he said.

Three years ago, at the start of his five-year term, Widodo outlined a need for $450 billion investment in infrastructure by 2019. He anticipated 37 percent would come from private companies, up from only 9 percent on average in 2011-2015.

He wanted SOEs’ share of investment financing to be reduced to 22 percent, from 33 percent in 2011-2015, with the remainder coming from central and regional government budgets.

He’s nowhere near that target. Andi Rukman Karumpa, secretary general of the National Construction Services Association, estimated 80 percent of public projects are still handled by SOEs, using their own funding or the state budget.

SUBWAY, AIRPORT LINK TAKE SHAPE

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in July SOEs had an advantage with government backing and in navigating red tape. But “for Indonesia to continue to have a thriving economy, you need to actively encourage private sector involvement”.

The World Bank in its October economic review said Indonesia needed to spend $1.5 trillion to catch up with other comparable emerging economies. Even if it invested at the rate promised, it would take 20 years to match the average infrastructure stock of emerging markets, the Bank said.

The government allocated around $72 billion in infrastructure-related spending up to 2017, including capital injections to SOEs, and wants parliament to approve $30 billion more next year.

Although Indonesia has won funding from multinational lenders such as the World Bank, as well as China and Japan, the projects mostly went to SOEs. They include a $4.5 billion Jakarta to Bandung high-speed rail link funded by China Development Bank, which will be built by a consortium of Chinese and local SOEs.

Karumpa at the construction association wants the government to double the minimum project size project that SOEs can take to 100 billion rupiah ($7.38 million), so private firms can at least take over smaller publicly funded projects.

For most Indonesians, just getting basic infrastructure, whoever builds it, is what matters.

After a string of delays, traffic-clogged Jakarta is due to finally have a mass rapid transit system, the first for the G20 nation, in 2019 and a rail link to the city’s airport is set to launch next year.

Japanese companies, including Obayashi Corp (1802.T), are working with state-run builder Wijaya Karya (WIKA.JK) and private PT Jaya Konstruksi Manggala Pratama (JKON.JK) on the MRT.

The airport railway is being built by two SOEs, PT Kereta Api Indonesia and PT Angkasa Pura II.

The Trump administration is on the precipice of making a major – and little-noticed – mistake in its foreign policy. As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

MUNICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - BMW’s (BMWG.DE) headquarters were raided by European Union officials investigating an alleged cartel among German carmakers, it said on Friday, as rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE) claimed whistleblower status in an effort to avoid fines.

EU staff had “conducted an inspection” at BMW’s Munich offices this week, the premium carmaker said in a statement, adding that it is “assisting the European Commission in its work”.

The EU’s Brussels executive said its antitrust officials had swooped unannounced on “a carmaker in Germany” on Monday Oct. 16 in the first confirmed raid related to allegations that several German automakers had engaged in an illegal cartel.

The competition watchdog said in July that it was investigating collusion among German carmakers in response to a tip-off after Der Spiegel magazine reported that Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its Audi and Porsche arms conspired to fix prices in diesel and other technologies over decades.

“The BMW Group wishes to make clear the distinction between potential violations of antitrust law on the one hand and illegal manipulation of exhaust gas treatment on the other,” the company said. “The BMW Group has not been accused of the latter.”

Brussels has yet to initiate formal antitrust proceedings against any of the carmakers.

However, the allegations have begun to spawn U.S. lawsuits, adding to strains on an industry already struggling with the reputational fallout from widespread diesel emissions-test manipulation exposed in the wake of VW’s dieselgate scandal.

Daimler said on Friday that it had “filed an application for immunity from fines with the European Commission some time ago”, effectively claiming to have blown the whistle on what Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber described as “possible antitrust agreements” with rival manufacturers.

Daimler sees no need to set aside any funds for possible antitrust fines, Uebber added.

To gain immunity, the EU’s antitrust website says, a company that participated in a cartel must be the first to inform the Commission of an undetected cartel by providing sufficient information to justify inspections.

The Commission has declined to identify the original source of the tip-off, saying this is to avoid compromising its investigation.

“Daimler is cooperating with the Commission under its leniency programme,” an EU representative said on Friday.

Volkswagen could also benefit from leniency after sharing information, according to earlier reports. Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.

VW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.

So it's as simple as sending a command to a computer using a mouse or a keyboard. But this time we're using asking you to use your brain. Now we want to bring this technology to the public at a early phase of its development so that we can create a dialogue about what kind of relationship we want to have with this technology in particular but also with man's relationship to technology in general."

Donald Trump’s undermining of the Iran nuclear deal only shrinks U.S. options for dealing with North Korea. The U.S. president’s decertification of Tehran’s compliance will be well noted in Pyongyang, giving North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a credible excuse for refusing to negotiate with Washington.

The U.S.-North Korea situation is becoming more fraught as both sides attempt to pile on pressure, pushing prospects for talks further away.

Just two months ago, I argued that Americans needed to put North Korea’s missile tests in perspective. (“Yes, they’re worrying. But the U.S. mainland is not in imminent danger.”) Now I’m slightly less sanguine: either side could make a catastrophic miscalculation while tensions persist. Even before Trump’s decision on Iran, the prospects for negotiations were diminishing.

Paul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit

For one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.

Insults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.

Second, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.

This reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.

This brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.

The agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.

The agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Trump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.

Crucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.

Trump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.

This is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.

On top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.

Moreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.

A negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s president gave the green light to conservative leader Sebastian Kurz on Friday to form a government, but Kurz gave little away about his coalition plans, leaving a tie-up with the far right the most likely outcome.

Kurz’s People’s Party (OVP) secured 31.5 percent of the vote in Sunday’s parliamentary election, winning by a clear margin but falling well short of the majority needed to control parliament in the affluent Alpine republic.

“I would like to build a government that has the courage and determination to bring real change to Austria,” Kurz, 31, told reporters after meeting President Alexander Van der Bellen, who will oversee the process.

Kurz campaigned on a platform that combined a hard line on immigration similar to that of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) with traditional conservative principles like slimming down the state and cutting taxes.

He said he would start by holding talks with all parties in parliament although only two of them, the Social Democrats (SPO) and FPO, have enough seats to give him a majority if they go into coalition with the OVP.

“I will now get straight to work and hold the first discussions, definitely in the coming days, and possibly even today,” Kurz said, adding that after those initial discussions he might launch formal coalition talks with one party.

Kurz went to Brussels on Thursday to assure European Union leaders of his support, allaying concerns that Austria country would become a dissonant voice in the EU with the anti-immigrant far right likely to enter its government.

It became clear after neighboring Germany’s election last month that it was headed towards a three-way “Jamaica” coalition - so called because the parties’ colors match that country’s flag. Austria’s political future could be colorful too.

Using the same principle and some creative licence, Austria’s next government could be dubbed “Botswana” or “Islamic State”. Two other options, “Haiti” and “Albania”, appear to be off the table, at least for the time being.

THOUSANDTH OF A THOUSANDTH

In Austria as in Germany, each party is traditionally associated with a color - black for Kurz’s OVP, red for the centre-left SPO and blue for the far-right FPO.

Botswana (black and blue) remains the most likely option, given that Kurz and the head of the Social Democrats, outgoing Chancellor Christian Kern, have often clashed and Kurz called an end to their coalition, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Kurz has said he would prefer to form a stable coalition but not ruled out a minority, monochrome government (Islamic State).

He has accused his rivals of holding talks on an SPO-FPO, “red-blue” coalition (Haiti). But FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache poured cold water on the idea of a “coalition of losers” in an interview with tabloid Oesterreich.

Asked if Kern had been voted out as chancellor, Strache said: “In my opinion, yes.” He added that people had voted for change and Kurz had a mandate to try and form a government.

“If he were to invite us (to hold coalition talks), we would accept the invitation,” he said, adding that in such a case the FPO would not hold parallel talks with the SPO.

Strache hosted Kurz at his home for dinner this week, their first one-on-one meeting, he said.

The chances of a red-blue alliance are “a thousandth of a thousandth”, Kern told reporters at an EU summit in Brussels, but he added that his party was still open to talks.

A black-red coalition (Albania) has not been completely ruled out. Kurz has hinted at being prepared to consider it if Kern is replaced as leader by Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil. Strache also focused his criticism on Kern rather than the SPO as a whole.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.

"Encountering objects for real that have in some shape or form figured in my books has been quite wonderful," she said in a statement. The exhibition runs from October 20 until February 28, 2018.

(Reuters) - The world’s top two oilfield services firms warned on Friday of a challenging fourth quarter for the industry, as investment slows due to soft oil prices and energy firms reducing activity on offshore rigs.

Shares of Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) dropped nearly 5 percent to a 21-month low of $61.41, while Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) tumbled 5.2 percent to a 16-month low of $31.44. Halliburton Co (HAL.N), scheduled to report on Monday, was little changed.

Last year, as oil prices bounced off multi-year lows hit at the start of 2016, optimism began to creep back into the energy industry. But after rising about 50 percent last year, Brent crude prices LCOc1 have barely budged this year, up a shade over 1 percent, which has again led to caution in the industry.

Schlumberger said investments in North America were moderating as energy companies increasingly shied away from chasing higher production at the cost of financial returns.

“In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity continued to weaken in the third quarter, and the outlook remains bleak for this region based on current customer plans,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said.

Kibsgaard said he expects the rate of growth in North America to slow and that market estimates for the fourth quarter, as they stand, are “potentially on the high end.”

Baker Hughes’ CEO Lorenzo Simonelli was even more pessimistic, and forecast the overall oil and gas environment to remain challenging for the rest of the year.

“We have seen some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments.”

The dour outlooks come as U.S. oil producers are under pressure to boost shareholder returns after 2017 spending increases ran into flattish oil prices, knocking share prices back after a run up last year.

This summer, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess Corp (HES.N) cut second-half capital spending plans, including on oilfield services activities, due to weaker-than-expected U.S. crude prices CLc1.

The sub-$55 prices have also weighed on offshore exploration and driven a new round of consolidation among drillers in a bid to tame excess capacity and get price increases.

A recent survey by Deloitte showed most top U.S. oil executives see prices remaining below $60 per barrel through 2018 and not hitting $70 until at least the next decade.

Baker Hughes, in its first report to include GE Co’s (GE.N) oil and gas business since their merger, reported a third-quarter profit that missed analysts estimates by a wide margin.

Schlumberger, however, matched analysts’ profit estimates and posted a 43 percent jump in business from North America.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Business Secretary Greg Clark will hold talks in Canada on Friday to discuss Airbus SE’s plans to buy a majority stake in Bombardier’s C-Series jetliner program aimed at helping it avoid high U.S. import tariffs.

Clark will meet with Canadian government officials and executives from the two manufacturers, according to a spokeswoman for the ministry for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

A deal announced earlier this week gives Airbus (AIR.PA) a controlling stake in the Canadian manufacturer’s troubled C-Series jets, which are partly made in Northern Ireland.

The tie up gives Bombardier (BBDb.TO) a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N), in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose 300 percent import duties, potentially threatening thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.

Under the deal, Airbus would take a 50.01 percent stake in the C Series and add an assembly line for the plane in Alabama, thus becoming a U.S.-made product so it can avoid anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.

The Boeing-Bombardier dispute has snowballed into a bigger multilateral trade dispute, with British Prime Minister Theresa May wading into the debate and asking U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene in order save British jobs.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, which is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four nations and remains mired in political sensitivities after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.

Low pay, no bonus: U.S. retailers struggle with hiring

(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire employees for stores and for middle and higher management as low pay and a feeling of uncertainty clouds the industry following a spate of bankruptcies and store closures.
The staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.
“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.
The job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.
“So when the brick-and-mortar retail is really struggling, at that executive level, people are concerned about staying in retail.”

Retailers including Macy’s Inc and J.C. Penney have said they will hire the same or fewer seasonal workers for the holidays this year than last, while some, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc, have chosen not to hire temporary workers at all.

Sector observers have attributed this to brick-and-mortar retailers’ retreat under pressure from online players including Amazon, and firms themselves say they have simply taken a staggered approach to hiring this year that fills gaps slowly. Macy’s said holiday hiring was “off to a great start”.

But staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand.

The staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.

“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.

Her clients include Lowe’s Cos Inc, Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs.

U.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the “gig economy” and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool.

The hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month.

The job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.

“There just aren’t enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,” the site’s chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.

NO BONUS

The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs.

Recruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more.

“The jobs have become bigger,” Manpower Group’s Hassett said. “A manager will do more at the stores, they’ll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to.”

Wal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.

“We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,” said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart’s senior manager of corporate communications.

J.C. Penney said it was introducing paid time off for part-time hourly associates, starting from early 2018, to entice seasonal hires to stay beyond the holiday season.

Higher up the food chain, recruiters also point to bonuses that have lagged other industries as harming efforts to draw in and keep talented regional managers or heads of business lines.

“They (retailers) are paying lower bonuses and some companies have paid lower bonuses for a couple of years,” talent acquisition firm Korn Ferry’s retail expert Craig Rowley said.

An analysis by Korn Ferry of 40 big North American retailers showed that 73 percent paid little to no bonuses to senior executives for their performance in 2016. Thirty five percent paid no bonus, up from 25 percent last year.

“It’s the perception of where retail as an industry is going,” Manpower’s Hassett said. “So when the brick-and-mortar retail is really struggling, at that executive level, people are concerned about staying in retail.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.

SPARTANBURG/CHARLESTON, South Carolina (Reuters) - Years before Donald Trump began promising to bring back good manufacturing jobs by getting tough with U.S. trade partners, such jobs have already been on the rise, largely thanks to foreign companies now cast as villains in Trump’s narrative.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) sank deeper into crisis on Friday as the embattled company said it had lost some customers to competitors because of widespread data falsification that had extended to its mainstream steel sheet business.

Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, which supplies the world’s top airline and automobile manufacturers, also said it had violated statutory standards set by the industry ministry, pushing the scandal beyond failure to meet specifications agreed with customers.

Until now, the 112-year-old company had said products it sold with falsified data met safety and other standards but did not meet contract specifications agreed with customers. It had also said the problem was mainly with aluminium and copper products.

Kobe Steel has an extensive role in global supply chains - the company produces engine valve springs found in half the world’s cars, according to its website.

Kobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara said the company had found a breach of industrial standards at its Hatano copper plant southwest of Tokyo, along with a new case of falsification of data at a unit that cuts and processes steel plate.

”There has been also some impact on our business as we have lost credibility,” Umehara told a news conference, citing cases that the company lost orders and customers switched to its competitors. “But we can’t quantify the impact at the moment.”

He said the Hatano plant did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards for quality management after it faked data on tensile strength and other properties of copper and copper-alloy piping.

Kobe Steel has stopped shipping about 43 percent of copper products from the plant over the problems with the statutory standards, a company spokeswoman said.

Two certification companies said on Thursday they were investigating whether the plant is in line with a global standard on quality control.

They could suspend or cancel the “ISO9001” certification of the plant if it doesn’t meet the standard, which could affect its business as many global buyers require suppliers to use the benchmark.

Kobe Steel said it also found, as the result of a whistleblower, that a plant in western Japan had been ”obstructing company’s voluntary inspection” by concealing data.

After getting a tip that workers at the Chofu plant failed to report data falsification on aluminium extrusion products, the company decided to set up a panel of outsiders, replacing an in-house panel led by the company’s president.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry believes “the data concealment by its employees has hurt the credibility of Kobe Steel’s voluntary investigation,” said Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division.

The ministry ordered the company on Friday to expedite its probes and report results as soon as possible.

Kobe Steel previously said that it found widespread falsification of data on the strength and durability of copper and aluminium products sent to customers. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.

JUSTICE PROBE

Global automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products because of the falsification, although four Japanese carmakers said on Thursday they have found no safety issues with aluminium parts supplied by Kobe Steel.

The company is now subject to a U.S. Justice Department probe while checks continue at hundreds of its clients involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. But in Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.

“We are worried about the U.S. Justice Department probe,” said a source at one of the company’s lenders. “The impact will be very big if the DOJ seeks a criminal case against Kobe and hits it with huge financial penalties.”

The company has started selling assets to raise fund, on Friday holding the first round of an auction to sell its most of a property unit, sources told Reuters on Friday, a deal that reportedly could raise over $400 million.

Kobe Steel’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out.

Kobe Steel shares fell 1.6 percent on Friday. They have fallen nearly 40 percent since it revealed the problems on Oct. 8, wiping about $1.60 billion off its market value.

The move came after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell this week rejected Trump’s calls to punish players who kneel for the anthem to protest racism. Trump has said the protests are unpatriotic and disrespectful of military veterans.

“The President has asked for a list of supporters who stand for the National Anthem. Add your name below to show your patriotism and support,” said the petition issued on Thursday by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a fundraising organization for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

The petition was published on the Republican National Committee website. It did not indicate how many signatures had been received.

Players kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” are protesting the killing of unarmed black men and boys by police across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the country’s criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.

Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first popularized the gesture last year, said he settled on kneeling as a form of protest because it is widely seen as a gesture of respect.

Goodell said on Wednesday after a meeting of league owners that the NFL would continue to nurture players’ efforts to fight racial disparities in the criminal justice system, believing this would make the urge to protest fade.

Trump has repeatedly expressed disdain for the protests since a rally in September. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, he called the NFL’s decision, “Too much talk, not enough action.”

The 20-year-old is a hot property in the sport after becoming the youngest ever race winner, in Spain last year at the age of 18. He also won in Malaysia earlier this month, a day after his birthday.

The son of former racer Jos has been linked to both Mercedes and Ferrari in media speculation but Red Bull were determined to lock in a youngster widely seen as a future world champion.

Team principal Christian Horner emphasized his importance to the future of the team in a statement at the U.S. Grand Prix.

“He is pure racer, with an undeniable talent at the wheel and a rare instinct for what it takes to compete consistently at this level,” said Horner.

“As we now look to the long term with Max, he is in the best place in the sport to build a team around him to deliver our shared ambition.”

Red Bull’s other driver is 28-year-old Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who has also been frequently linked in the past to Ferrari.

Both Verstappen and Ricciardo, also a race winner this season, already had contracts for 2018 but the focus will now be on the Australian’s next move.

Verstappen’s deal, effectively a one-year extension since his original contract was set to expire at the end of 2019, means that the top three teams are set to have their star drivers signed up for the next three years.

Ferrari have four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel under contract until 2020 while Lewis Hamilton is expected to agree a similar deal with Mercedes.

The triple world champion’s current deal expires at the end of 2018.

Verstappen, who made his Formula One debut with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso at the age of 17 in 2015, said the Austrian energy drink company had always shown their faith in him.

“They have always backed me and my ambition and I know we share that ambition,” he said.

“I’m very happy to commit further to Red Bull Racing and I’m looking forward to working together to enjoy more success in the years to come.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank supervisors are having to rethink their proposals for dealing with the euro zone’s huge pile of legacy bad loans after complaints from Italy that it would hinder the country’s recovery, four senior central bank sources told Reuters.

The ECB’s Single Supervisory Mechanism is due to come up with a new set of rules by March for how much money banks should set aside against their stock of bad loans, a thorny issue in Italy, where lenders are sitting on more than a quarter of the euro zone’s 865 billion euros ($1.0 trillion) unpaid loans.

But the sources said the strong Italian backlash against the SSM’s latest proposals on how lenders should deal with new bad loans meant supervisors were having to reassess their approach to tackling already soured debts.

“There is a serious risk that the SSM’s coming proposal will be too soft,” said one of the sources, all of whom are close to or on the ECB’s decision making body.

The ECB declined to comment.

The main worry for Italy is that its banks, if asked to set aside more money, will curb lending. Some may need to raise capital - a task that has eluded Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two regional lenders in recent months, triggering state interventions.

With the new guidelines not due out until the first quarter of next year, no proposal has yet been sent to the ECB’s supervisory board.

But SSM staff have been working on four scenarios modeled on the current guidelines on new non-performing loans (NPLs), which give banks seven years to provide for credit backed by collateral and two years for unsecured debt, another source said.

One of these options would require banks to start building up provisions for their legacy loans straight away, albeit gradually.

A more generous one would stop the clock for one or two years, effectively giving banks until 2021 and 2026 for hitting their targets.

They are now all in jeopardy.

“Now even the most generous scenario might appear too strict,” the source said. “It’s all in flux.”

The ECB’s guidelines will also be influenced by a legislative proposal that the European Commission is preparing in parallel and could include measures on provisions, the sources said.

This is to avoid any risk of clashing with Brussels after the Italian head of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, openly questioned the ECB’s authority on the matter and raised the specter of an unprecedented dispute between the institutions.

In a most extreme outcome, which one source said the SSM is likely to resist, supervisors would stop short of setting rules for all banks in the euro zone, merely publishing criteria that could be applied differently across firms and countries.

SEEKING SUPPORT

The publicity received by the backlash meant any new proposal was set to be subject to extra scrutiny by the ECB’s Governing Council, which includes national central bank governors and approves SSM’s decisions.

Here Italy hopes to receive support from other countries with heavy bad loan burdens such as Greece, Portugal and Spain.

The sources said that will not be easy as these countries had spent or were saving political capital at the ECB for domestic issues, such as Greece’s latest bailout review, Portugal’s sale of state-owned Novo Banco and risks associated with the Catalan government’s independence push, the sources said.

“They are not keen to make any fuss,” one of the sources said.

While the co-ordinated backlash by Tajani, the Italian government, central bank and banking lobby was also likely to result in some changes to the guidelines on new bad loans, under consultation until Dec. 8, an overhaul was unlikely as it would dent the SSM’s credibility, the sources said.

But they stressed the new rules already allow for flexibility as banks are allowed to deviate from the prescribed timelines if they can explain why, for example by showing they can recoup some of the money.

Ratings agency S&P Global expects Italian banks to sell 100-120 billion euro in problem loan sales by 2019 and said offloading large amounts at current prices could lead to some needing fresh capital.

Among many of us in the generations that have done well out of the post-World War Two period, there’s now a feeling of guilt - as there should be.

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

Post-war generations, especially the “boomers” (my own) have let the good times roll for too long. If that sounds unduly pessimistic in the face of continuing advances in many fields, neglectful of the fact that bad stuff always happens but the world continues, then reflect on the triggers – the list could be expanded - whose pulling could precipitate disaster. These concerns are no longer the subject of academic discussion or obscure papers from the World Bank or the United Nations. They are real, present and above all known to us. Why should our young forgive us if we do not take them seriously?

Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance with it, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

“If you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,” Kerry said.

He was speaking in a private lecture delivered at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.

“And secondly, screw around with the deal that has already been made because the message is, don’t make a deal with the United States, they won’t keep their word,” he said.

The nuclear deal places Iran under tough restraints, including inspections, round-the-clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced, Kerry said. “We would notice an uptick in their enrichment, like that,” he said, snapping his fingers.

“And nobody that I know of with common sense can understand what the virtue is in accelerating a confrontation with the possibility that they might decide they want to break out and make it (a nuclear bomb) now instead of 10 or 15 or 25 years from now.”

Kerry, a former Senator who headed the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Swiss media that Trump’s leaving the Iranian deal’s fate to Congress was “very dangerous” and opened the door to “party politics”.

Congress cannot unilaterally renegotiate a multilateral accord, the Geneva daily Le Temps quoted him as saying. “It is possible that Congress would make an unreasonable decision that would put Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a very complicated political situation that could force him to retaliate. It’s a slippery slope.”

Khamenei said on Wednesday that Tehran would stick to its accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

If Iran violated the accord, U.N. sanctions would snap back into place, Kerry told the audience. “Moreover, at that point in time folks, we have a year of break-up. We have all the time that we need in the world to be able to bomb their facilities into submission.”

Ending the deal could lead to Iran hiding fissile production facilities “deep in a mountain where we have no insight”.

“So the scenario that Trump opens up by saying ‘let’s get rid of the deal’ is actually proliferation, far more damaging and dangerous,” Kerry said.

BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces took control on Friday of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said.

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad’s wishes.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties.

The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.

The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.

The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.

Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

Iraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.

Sistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.

ACCUSATIONS

Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Iraq’s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war.

Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.

Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.

“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.

An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.

Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Global bank watchdogs are acting as a line of defense against a U.S. deregulatory push. The U.S. Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the post-crisis bank resolution regime, as some Republicans urge. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it’s ditched.

What’s known as orderly liquidation authority was established to avoid confusion if a complex financial institution fails, like Lehman Brothers did a decade ago. Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp the power to resolve bank holding companies, systemically important non-banks and other financial firms, and set up a fund to pay for the associated costs. The FDIC would initially borrow from the Treasury, and recoup the expenses with a fee imposed on big banks.

Some congressional Republicans decry this arrangement as another taxpayer-funded bailout. They have introduced bills to eliminate OLA and replace it with an improved bankruptcy code. The criticisms prompted President Donald Trump in April to order Treasury to review the OLA, and assess whether bankruptcy was a better method.

The U.S. debate ignores the global nature of big banks and the role international regulators play. The FDIC-supported method would resolve a firm at the holding company level, eliminating the need for each division - including overseas units - to have their own wind-down plans. Overseas watchdogs would defer to U.S. regulators and work in close cooperation with them. Bankruptcy judges don’t have those relationships and the process, even with improvements, would be too slow to handle the fast-paced chaos of a large, failing bank.

Overseas regulators have smartly worked to get ahead of the decision, warning that without OLA, U.S. banks’ overseas subsidiaries could be subject to higher capital requirements, restructuring and ringfencing. Wall Street also supports maintaining the liquidation authority. Despite Trump’s threats to gut Dodd-Frank, Steven Mnuchin’s Treasury Department so far has been level-headed in its recommendations for revising bank regulations and rules overseeing capital markets. The threat from global watchdogs is another reason to discount the odds of a major rollback of financial rules.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Air pollution in New Delhi hit 18 times the healthy limit on Friday under a thick, toxic haze after a night of fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali - despite a court-ordered ban on their sales.

Residents of the sprawling Indian capital, which already ranks among the world’s most polluted cities, complained of eyes watering and aggravated coughs as levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that reaches deep into the lungs, rose alarmingly.

Air quality usually worsens in New Delhi ahead of Diwali, the festival of lights, and the Supreme Court temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers, aiming to lessen the risk to health.

But many still lit fireworks across the capital late into the night, either using old stocks or buying them from neighboring states.

Some environment activists said the court order was poorly enforced and firecrackers were still available to celebrate one of north India’s biggest festivals.

“Breathe nitrate and ammonia, home grown, hand made!” said environmentalist Vimlendu Jha in a Twitter post calling for city authorities to declare a public emergency.

An index of air quality had crossed the “hazardous” limit of 300 on Friday, the most severe level on a U.S. embassy scale of measurement which rates a reading of 50 as good and anything above that as a cause for concern.

Some parts of Delhi such as Mandir Marg showed an air quality reading of 941, close enough to the maximum level of 999 beyond which no readings are available. The index measures concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide among other indicators.

A hazardous level is an alert in which everyone may experience ill effects and are advised to stay indoors.

Apart from the firecracker ban, the Supreme Court also ordered diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down to try to reduce the pollution. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority also ordered some brick kilns to close and a halt to the burning of rubbish.

Dipankar Saha, a scientist at the government’s Central Pollution Control Board, said the still weather had also played a part in the toxic haze hanging over the city.

But pollution levels were better than at last year’s Diwali when crop burning in nearby states and firecrackers combined.

“It was going to be hard to beat last year’s level in any case,” he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled Brexit talks on Friday, with European Union leaders signaling their readiness to move the negotiations forward in the coming months.

But despite a more positive tone, a weakened May now faces a delicate political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without stoking a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from the talks.

EU leaders said at a summit in Brussels that they would begin preparations to move into “phase two” of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.

Yet they also made clear that May would have to move between now and the end of the year on settling a financial bill that EU officials have estimated at around 60 billion euros.

“I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit, saying movement on the financial settlement was crucial for progress in December.

French President Emmanuel Macron was tougher, saying the two sides had not yet completed even half of the work on the financial settlement and accusing Britain of “bluffing” by using the media to suggest there could be no deal.

“A lot is in the hands of Theresa May,” he said. An EU official said it took just 90 seconds for the 27 other leaders to adopt their Brexit conclusions at the end of the meeting, underlining how united they are.

May has said she cannot provide a specific financial pledge until she knows the shape of the future relationship. The EU is insisting that the two sides agree on an exit bill, the rights of EU citizens in a post-Brexit world and Irish border issues before delving into future ties.

Asked whether she had improved an offer of about 20 billion euros, May said she had repeated commitments she made in a speech in Italy last month, when she said the bloc would not be out of pocket when it came to its budget which runs until 2020.

“What I made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contributions... is that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plans ... and that we will honor the commitments that we have made during our membership,” she told a news conference before returning to Britain.

NO MOVEMENT YET

The final text from the EU-27 read: “The European Union ... notes that, while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.”

Still, the leaders held open the hope of reaching a deal at the next regular summit in December. And in a move that could save weeks of delay, they ordered EU negotiators to start preparing for what Brussels will want in a transition period.

Uncertainty over the final shape of a Brexit deal has unsettled businesses on both sides of the Channel.

Terry Scuoler, CEO of the British manufacturers’ association (EEF), welcomed the warmer words from EU leaders, but said industry needed “more than a hint of progress”.

All the EU leaders worked hard to strike a positive tone at the summit after May used a dinner late on Thursday to appeal to the other 27 leaders to help her silence critics at home by offering a signal that the talks would move on.

Many were upbeat and May struck up an animated and friendly conversation at the beginning of the summit with Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who are both seen in Britain as hardliners in the talks.

That might be enough for May to calm immediate concerns at home after Brexit campaigners urged the British prime minister to signal her readiness to leave the EU without a deal and to rely on World Trade Organization rules.

But she faces a major dilemma as she gears up for the next EU summit in December.

“The next eight weeks will be the most challenging for ... Theresa May and the most consequential for Brexit,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group.

The chair of the summit Donald Tusk said there would need to be a more positive narrative to reach a Brexit deal in December - a sentiment echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

“We have some details but we don’t have all the details we need,” he said. “It’s not my working assumption that we’ll have no deal.”

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - O presidente da Oi, Marco Schroeder, afirmou nesta sexta-feira que a empresa está totalmente preparada para a assembleia de credores marcada para segunda-feira, mas que aguarda decisão do juiz de sua recuperação judicial a respeito do pedido de adiamento feito por alguns credores.
Nesta sexta-feira, vários grupos de detentores de títulos da Oi pediram adiamento da assembleia de segunda-feira, incluindo o Comitê Internacional, o Grupo Ad Hoc, Banco do Brasil, BNDES e Caixa Econômica Federal.
Obviamente nós vamos aproveitar para ver se chega com um plano já na assembleia com um pouco mais de apoio consolidado”, disse o presidente da Oi em referência às negociações com credores.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - O presidente da Oi, Marco Schroeder, afirmou nesta sexta-feira que a empresa está totalmente preparada para a assembleia de credores marcada para segunda-feira, mas que aguarda decisão do juiz de sua recuperação judicial a respeito do pedido de adiamento feito por alguns credores.

Falando a jornalistas após reunião de executivos do setor com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, Schroeder disse que “até o momento” a reunião de credores da Oi está confirmada para segunda-feira, mas caso seja adiada, a operadora vai prosseguir com as conversas.

Nesta sexta-feira, vários grupos de detentores de títulos da Oi pediram adiamento da assembleia de segunda-feira, incluindo o Comitê Internacional, o Grupo Ad Hoc, Banco do Brasil, BNDES e Caixa Econômica Federal.

A assembleia deveria ter ocorrido em 9 de outubro, mas no final de setembro ela foi adiada para a próxima segunda-feira após pedido da própria Oi ao juiz da recuperação judicial da empresa, Fernando Viana, da 7ª Vara Empresarial da Justiça do Rio de Janeiro.

“Existe espaço para convergir se tiver mais algumas semanas. Obviamente nós vamos aproveitar para ver se chega com um plano já na assembleia com um pouco mais de apoio consolidado”, disse o presidente da Oi em referência às negociações com credores.

Schroeder destacou que, se houver adiamento da assembleia, a próxima data já está marcada para 27 de novembro.

A assembleia é necessária para validação do plano de recuperação judicial apresentado pela companhia em 11 de outubro, no qual propôs limite de 25 por cento à conversão de títulos dívida em ações, bem abaixo do pretendido por detentores de títulos da companhia. Se houver rejeição, a falência da empresa poderá ser decretada.

A Oi entrou com pedido de recuperação judicial em junho do ano passado e até agora acionistas e detentores de títulos da empresa não chegaram a um acordo sobre a reestruturação da companhia que declarou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais e 55 mil credores.

Para a assembleia de segunda-feira, a Oi espera presença de até 5 mil pessoas ao anfiteatro do pavilhão 6 do centro de convenções Riocentro, que tem capacidade para 6 mil pessoas. A equipe organizadora do evento envolve cerca de 1.000 pessoas. Uma praça de alimentação foi também reservada no local e haverá 100 pontos para os credores votarem.

“Serão três dias longos pela frente”, disse uma fonte da operadora se referindo à maratona de discussões entre esta sexta-feira e a próxima segunda-feira.

TROCA POR INVESTIMENTOS

Em Brasília, o presidente da Oi destacou ainda que a empresa não está pedindo recursos públicos à União, mas condições de parcelamento de sua dívida semelhantes às que já existem no âmbito do Refis, por exemplo, além de a possibilidade de trocar multas por investimentos.

Schroeder seguiu na sequência para a Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel), que convocou para a próxima segunda feira, às 11h, reunião extraordinária de seu conselho diretor para analisar um pedido de acordo da Oi para conversão de multas em investimentos. Segundo uma fonte próxima ao assunto, este Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta (TAC) que será discutido na semana que vem envolve multas que somam cerca de 5 bilhões de reais.

As ações ordinárias da Oi tinham valorização de 0,7 por cento às 12:12 e os papéis preferenciais mostravam ganho de 0,92 por cento.

De acordo com os executivos que participaram do encontro com Meirelles nesta sexta-feira, a situação específica da Oi não foi abordada na reunião, que tratou especialmente de projeto sobre mudança do regime de concessão para autorização e eventual mudança na metodologia de cálculo de PIS-Cofins que oneraria o setor.

“Nós temos hoje um marco regulatório e uma carga tributária que são incompatíveis com o desenvolvimento futuro do setor”, disse o presidente da Vivo, Eduardo Navarro, citando quase 1 milhão de telefones públicos no Brasil que segundo ele não têm uso.

“Não viemos pedir para fazer nenhuma redução na carga tributária. Embora desejada, nós entendemos que o momento é inapropriado. Mas basicamente nós viemos pedir para não aumentar mais”, acrescentou.

De acordo com Navarro, o ministro apenas ouviu os presentes, sem tecer comentários a respeito do que era possível fazer.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - T-Mobile US et Sprint comptent annoncer leur fusion sans cessions d‘actifs dans l‘immédiat, les deux groupes de télécommunications comptant négocier ensuite ce point-là avec les autorités de tutelle, ont déclaré dimanche des sources proches du dossier.

Reuters avait rapporté la semaine passée que certains membres du département concurrence du Trésor américain doutaient que cette opération, rapprochant les troisième et quatrième opérateurs télécoms mobiles américains, puisse se faire en l‘état.

T-Mobile US, filiale de Deutsche Telekom, et Sprint, contrôlé par le groupe japonais Softbank, pensent annoncer leur fusion fin octobre ou début novembre et mettre surtout l‘accent sur les avantages qu‘elle comporterait pour le consommateur américain, en particulier dans la promotion de la future technologie 5G, ont expliqué les sources.

T-Mobile et Sprint se sont refusé à tout commentaire.

“Il vaut mieux pour Sprint et T-Mobile apprendre des régulateurs quelles sont leurs préoccupations puis voir comment il est possible d‘y répondre”, dit Craig Moffett, analyste de MoffettNathanson.

L‘entité née de la fusion représenterait plus de 130 millions d‘abonnés, se classant juste derrière Verizon Communications et AT&T.

Son chiffre d‘affaires dépasserait 70 milliards de dollars (58,50 milliards d‘euros) et les analystes estiment très élevé le potentiel de réduction des coûts.

John Hodulik, analyste d‘UBS, estime que la Commission fédérale des Communications (FCC) obligera sans doute les deux opérateurs à céder certaines fréquences car la nouvelle entité aurait le plus grand nombre de fréquences de moins de 300 MHz, devant Verizon et AT&T.

Disposer d‘un large spectre de fréquences est particulièrement important pour développer la 5G, surtout face à la concurrence des services à haut débit des câblo-opérateurs.

Les actionnaires de Sprint ne bénéficieront que d‘une prime modeste, voire inexistante, dans cette fusion, ce qui veut dire que Softbank et d‘autres actionnaires de Sprint auront autour de 40% de la nouvelle structure. Deutsche Telekom et les autres actionnaires de T-Mobile US auront le reste.

Cela étant, préviennent les sources, il se peut aussi que les négociations entre T-Mobile et Sprint ne débouchent sur rien.

GE vows $20 billion asset sales, 'sweeping change' as profit falls

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Calling its results “horrible” and “unacceptable,” General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new chief executive vowed on Friday to shed more than $20 billion worth of assets and hold executives accountable for failing to deliver profits.

His comments came as GE badly missed Wall Street expectations and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares down 2.9 percent to $22.90.

GE’s good businesses are being held back by others that “drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward,” Chief Executive John Flannery said on a conference with analysts.

“We will have a simpler, more focused portfolio” in coming months, he said.

Flannery declined to say what is on the chopping block, details he is due to unveil on Nov. 13, though he voiced support for GE’s 3D-printing and digital-industrial businesses.

But analysts had clear ideas: “GE will likely sell transportation, lighting and about anything else that isn’t nailed down and very core,” analyst Scott Davis at Melius Research wrote in a note on Friday.

Investors are pushing for big change after being frustrated for more than a decade by poor returns at the 125-year-old maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment.

Even before the stock’s decline on Friday, GE produced a total return - share appreciation plus reinvested dividends - of just 0.64 percent over the last 16 years. A $1,000 investment on the day former CEO Jeff Immelt started his tenure would be worth $1,006.38 today. Immelt stepped down Aug. 1.

As proof of GE’s new approach to performance, outgoing CFO Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.

“That sense of accountability has to start with me,” he said. “We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me.”

GE’s poor financial performance in the third quarter showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE’s highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark “robust dialog,” he said and shedding some of the 18 directors was “being examined.”

GE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.

GE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.

GE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said. Industrial cash flow from operations fell mainly ”because of lower power volume, resulting in lower earnings and higher inventory.”

Profit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.

Revenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHGE.N).

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) disappointed Wall Street with sales on Friday, a week after it claimed to have fought off hedge-fund manager Nelson Peltz’s move to muscle onto the board and force more dramatic change at the consumer goods giant.

Net sales in the firm’s first quarter results rose just 1 percent to $16.65 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $16.69 billion and knocking the Gillette razor maker’s shares 3 percent lower soon after opening in New York.

The company has been trying to revive stagnant sales, one of the key issues Peltz had with P&G in his contentious and very public fight for a board seat, which preliminary results suggest he lost by a hair.

Peltz pushed for a re-organization that P&G said would lead to a break-up of the company and said P&G’s “suffocating bureaucracy” was causing it to lose market share, especially at its more profitable businesses.

P&G argued that it whittled down its portfolio to 60 brands, many of them world-wide popular names, and lopped off several business units to streamline and Peltz’s suggestions did not move the needle in terms of what the company was already doing.

At an annual general meeting earlier this month, preliminary votes showed that Peltz lost his bid by a slim margin. Peltz has said he would contest the vote and would not concede until an independent arbiter had certified the votes.

On Friday, P&G reported higher sales of beauty and home care products, but another weak performance in its grooming business eroded some of that growth.

Sales in the grooming business fell more than analysts’ had anticipated despite P&G cutting prices on tough competition from upstarts like Dollar Shave Club.

“Grooming was especially weak,” RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi said noting that the business had seen sales declines for three quarters and missed his own estimates of a 2 percent decline.

The company, however, said it was maintaining its full-year organic sales and adjusted profit forecast. But it also said it expects a $300 million hit from commodity costs related to the hurricanes that battered the southern U.S. this year.

Net income attributable to the company rose 5 percent to $2.85 billion or $1.06 per share in the first quarter ended Sept. 30.

The company saw a bright spot at sales in its beauty business, which rose 5 percent, on the rising demand of ultra-premium SK-II skincare products in China. Strong demand for Tide detergents and Febreze fragrances boosted sales at its Fabric and Home Care business by 2 percent.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 1 cent.

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Kizza Besigye, who has contested and lost four elections against long-time leader Museveni, was detained on Thursday.

Police blamed Besigye for the deaths of two protesters during Wednesday’s rally, in which officers fired bullets and teargas during clashes with government opponents.

“Besigye and his colleagues led these youths who stoned police and caused deaths,” police spokesman Denis Namuwoza told Reuters.

Wednesday’s clash in Rukungiri near the Rwandan border was one of several violent anti-Museveni protests that have spread across Uganda since the president last week for the first time openly expressed support for proposed legislation aimed at allowing him to stay in power.

In office for more than three decades, 73-year-old Museveni would be barred from running again in the next election in 2021 by a law that caps the age of presidential candidates at 75.

The proposed legislation would remove that age ceiling.

Besigye, Museveni’s former physician during the guerrilla struggle that brought him to power in 1986, has claimed the four elections the pair contested were all rigged - something Museveni has denied.

The president has been a staunch western ally widely seen as an anchor of stability in East Africa’s often volatile Great Lakes region.

He has deployed troops in Somalia to help fight Islamist group al Shabaab, earnings plaudits from his western backers.

‘HEAVY-HANDED TACTICS’

Besigye was arrested near the Rwandan border on Thursday, along with two other senior officials of his opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC).

Police spokesman Namuwoza said they had been charged with murder, assault, inciting violence and unlawful assembly, and transferred to a prison near the capital Kampala.

There was no immediate reaction to the arrests from Uganda’s opposition.

The proposed new law is widely seen by critics as paving the way for Museveni to rule for life. Similar moves in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi have spurred unrest.

Civil society organizations accused of helping rally support against extending Museveni’s rule have had their premises raided, offices searched and equipment confiscated.

Two of them, Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies (GLISS), a think tank, and ActionAid, a South Africa-based international charity, have had their bank accounts frozen on police orders.

In a statement on Thursday, the U.S. Embassy in Kampala criticized what it called “heavy-handed tactics of security forces” which it said harmed democracy.

“Government must protect people’s rights of assembly and expression,” it said.

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing “politics of division” that he said was corroding American democracy.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama told campaign rallies in New Jersey and Virginia that voters could send a powerful message about the type of politics they want by backing Democrats in Nov. 7 elections in the two states.

“What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before, that dates back centuries,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark, New Jersey, that chanted: “Four more years.”

“Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That’s folks looking 50 years back,” Obama said. “It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century.”

At a later stop in Richmond, Virginia, Obama said modern politics increasingly did not reflect basic American values of inclusiveness and were driving people away from the process.

“We’ve got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry, to demonize people who have different ideas, to get the base all riled up because it provides a short-term tactical advantage. Sometimes that feels frustrating,” Obama said.

Many of Obama’s comments appeared to be thinly veiled swipes at Trump, whose combative style and inflammatory rhetoric have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Obama made the remarks just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took an indirect swing at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade. [L2N1MU1XD]

Obama’s appearances were aimed at driving up Democratic turnout in New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states holding elections for governor this year. Democrats hope Obama can bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

CLOSELY WATCHED

The two contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can convert the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could offer clues to the national political mood ahead of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

While he has rarely spoken out about politics in the past nine months, Obama said it was critical that supporters get their friends and families to vote.

In Newark, he said no one should assume victory just because opinion polls show Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor.

“I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said in a reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

In the political battleground of Virginia, polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Speaking as a folksy physician running for Virginia governor, Democrat Ralph Northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight Donald Trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.

But Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.

The balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.

He is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

The Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.

After denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.

“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.

Most polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.

Former Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.

A recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.

Distain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.

Yet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.

“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.

The Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.

Northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.

“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.

The strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

She said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.

“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.

Gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.

Vice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.

Democratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.

She admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.

“Lieutenant Governor Northam has done a wonderful job of talking about Trump without mentioning Trump,” she said.

Adidas plans to use the factory - and another due to open soon in Atlanta, Georgia, to produce small batches designed for particular markets, and ultimately for individual consumers, in contrast to mass production runs ordered months in advance.

The idea is to respond faster to fashion trends and offer more customization. After London it plans shoe models inspired by Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.

“It is an opportunity for us to disrupt with brand new technologies and bring that as fast as possible to consumers,” David Drury, director of development for footwear sourcing, told Reuters.

Adidas relies on more than one million workers in factories in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam, to produce about 600 million pairs of shoes and items of clothing and accessories per year.

But it is shifting some production closer to its major markets so it can deliver new styles quicker, and counter rising wages in Asia and hefty shipping costs.

It currently takes Adidas up to 18 months to design, produce and deliver most products, but it wants to cut that to as little as 45 days.

Its customized shoes will also command premium prices. The AM4LDN shoe aimed at the London market will go on sale next week for 169.95 pounds ($222.74) or 219.95 euros ($259.85).

Rival Nike has also announced plans to shorten product development times and last month launched a studio in New York where customers can select the color and pattern of their shoes and have them ready in less than 90 minutes.

And then when you hear them then it sounds like a song, like a bird." Working with specialists from the Acoustic Research Institute they've built the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector, or A-MUD. It's helping them pinpoint and isolate mice vocalisations far more precisely than previous methods. Research published recently in PLoS ONE says it's revealing clues about their social behaviour. And presenting some confusing results, such as why some wild mice are reluctant to sing under lab conditions. SOUNDBITE (English) DR. SARAH ZALA, KONRAD LORENZ INSTITUTE OF ETHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE, SAYING: "Why do the wild mice males not sing? I want to know this. I really want to know this because it doesn't make any sense. If they attract mates, so you would expect them to sing to attract mates so it must have costs in the wild probably - we don't know." They're now eavesdropping on mice in more natural conditions in a bid to understand. It's research, they say, that could shed light on the evolution of vocal learning, and help neuroscientists better understand human speech disorders.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen major companies in technology and other industries are planning to launch a coalition to demand legislation that would allow young, illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The Coalition for the American Dream intends to ask Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “Dreamers,” to continue working in the United States, the documents said.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows.

Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

“We’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,” Intel spokesman Will Moss said in a statement.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

Many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.

“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview earlier on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.

“You will see this continue to escalate until the end of the year,” he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s AB Volvo reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly core earnings on Friday as stronger demand for heavy trucks more than offset costs stemming from strains on its supply chain, sending its shares to a record high.

Volvo and rivals in the truck industry such as Germany’s Daimler and Volkswagen have hit a sweet spot this year, with rising or already robust demand in all major commercial vehicles markets.
Volvo’s adjusted third-quarter operating profit rose to 7.02 billion Swedish crowns ($861 million) from 4.85 billion a year before, beating a mean forecast of 6.20 billion seen in a poll of analysts.

Sweden’s biggest manufacturer by sales also raised its outlook for truck markets on both sides of the North Atlantic this year and forecast a further strong recovery in sales of commercial vehicles in North America in 2018.

“These are blow-out numbers,” said analyst Hampus Engellau at Handelsbanken Capital Markets, which rates the stock “buy”.

Shares in Volvo rose 7.0 percent by 0800 GMT, leaving the stock up 56 percent so far this year.

Volvo and rivals in the truck industry such as Germany’s Daimler and Volkswagen have hit a sweet spot this year, with rising or already robust demand in all major commercial vehicles markets.

The broad upturn in demand was also in evidence in Daimler’s quarterly results, also released on Friday, with a double-digit rise in deliveries and a 32 percent jump in earnings at its trucks division.

Yet the buoyant demand has also come at a cost, with pressured supply chains leading components maker SAF-Holland to scale back its 2017 margin outlook this month, while Volvo’s profitability was dented in the second quarter.

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Volvo said stretched components supply had continued to have an impact in the third quarter, but with a 13 percent rise in truck deliveries and sharply higher earnings in its construction equipment arm, this was shrugged off.

CEO Martin Lundstedt, a former boss at rival Scania, said the bottlenecks that had mainly hit European truck manufacturing had eased somewhat in recent months, along with supplies of components for powertrains, or engines and axles.

“Still there is obviously a high level of pressure in the supply chain, but if you look through the quarter and after the vacation period it has been a continuous improvement, and we continue to see that,” Lundstedt told a news conference.

Volvo’s adjusted third-quarter operating profit rose to 7.02 billion Swedish crowns ($861 million) from 4.85 billion a year before, beating a mean forecast of 6.20 billion seen in a poll of analysts.

”There are really no negatives here,“ Engellau said. ”Construction Equipment is really strong and the trucks business continues to deliver in a seasonally weak quarter.

“Also order intake is extremely strong and it seems demand will accelerate even further ahead.”

Volvo has begun reaping the benefits of a 10 billion crown cost-cutting drive and in August set a target to reach its highest profitability since the sale of its car making arm to Ford nearly two decades ago.

Gothenburg-based Volvo said order intake of trucks at the group, which also includes brands such as Mack, Renault and UD Trucks, grew 32 percent in the quarter, beating the 15 percent rise seen by analysts.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and eight others injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital, two security sources said on Friday.

The sources said authorities were following a lead to an apartment thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and policemen since last year.

The suspected militants fled after the exchange of fire there, the sources said.

Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.

An Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule.

The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including Egypt’s Christian Copts.

MUNICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - BMW’s (BMWG.DE) headquarters were raided by European Union officials investigating an alleged cartel among German carmakers, it said on Friday, as rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE) claimed whistleblower status in an effort to avoid fines.

EU staff had “conducted an inspection” at BMW’s Munich offices this week, the premium carmaker said in a statement, adding that it is “assisting the European Commission in its work”.

The EU’s Brussels executive said its antitrust officials had swooped unannounced on “a carmaker in Germany” on Monday Oct. 16 in the first confirmed raid related to allegations that several German automakers had engaged in an illegal cartel.

The competition watchdog said in July that it was investigating collusion among German carmakers in response to a tip-off after Der Spiegel magazine reported that Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its Audi and Porsche arms conspired to fix prices in diesel and other technologies over decades.

“The BMW Group wishes to make clear the distinction between potential violations of antitrust law on the one hand and illegal manipulation of exhaust gas treatment on the other,” the company said. “The BMW Group has not been accused of the latter.”

Brussels has yet to initiate formal antitrust proceedings against any of the carmakers.

However, the allegations have begun to spawn U.S. lawsuits, adding to strains on an industry already struggling with the reputational fallout from widespread diesel emissions-test manipulation exposed in the wake of VW’s dieselgate scandal.

Daimler said on Friday that it had “filed an application for immunity from fines with the European Commission some time ago”, effectively claiming to have blown the whistle on what Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber described as “possible antitrust agreements” with rival manufacturers.

Daimler sees no need to set aside any funds for possible antitrust fines, Uebber added.

To gain immunity, the EU’s antitrust website says, a company that participated in a cartel must be the first to inform the Commission of an undetected cartel by providing sufficient information to justify inspections.

The Commission has declined to identify the original source of the tip-off, saying this is to avoid compromising its investigation.

“Daimler is cooperating with the Commission under its leniency programme,” an EU representative said on Friday.

Volkswagen could also benefit from leniency after sharing information, according to earlier reports. Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.

VW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.

The migrant route from Libya into Europe is one of the most heavily used, but also one of the most dangerous. These migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean last week. They say they've been lucky to dodge increased sea and police patrols. Last month, Reuters reported that an armed group was also stopping departures from Sabratha in Libya, a key springboard for smugglers. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MIGRANT FROM SIERRA LEONE, BUBA, SAYING: "Let me say it's a chance of luck. If you are lucky you make it. If you are unlucky they will karabouche you because there's plenty of ships." Slang for the various forces trying to stop the boats, the karabouche are accused of jailing migrants and then asking for money in order to free them. Some migrants say they have also suffered abuse while in detention. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MIGRANT FROM NIGERIA, AMBU, SAYING: "So every morning they would bring us out and beat us, flog us, with diverse type of punishment for we to call for our money. They gave food to call our people. While calling our people they would be beating us so we would cry so our people would hear our voice and know that, yes, we are suffering there." Italy has led European Union efforts to stop the flow of migrants from Libya to Europe. That has seen a twenty percent drop in arrivals in Italy this year, down to just over 100,000. But many charities say the EU plan isn't working. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MSF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS OFFICER ONBOARD THE SHIP AQUARIUS, NOOR CORNELISSEN SAYING: "You really have this sense of people being kicked around from one place to the next and unable to escape out of that. Doesn't matter how much ransom they are paying, doesn't matter who they are meeting along the journey. A lot of people, they perhaps leave their home country being smuggled but become trafficked along the way." These migrants lucky to escape detention. But many of those who are sent back will just keep trying, no matter how dangerous the journey.

A divisão de roubo e homicídio da polícia interrogou uma possível vítima de agressão sexual, disse o porta-voz Kevin Maiberger à Reuters. Nenhuma outra informação sobre quem fez as alegações ou sobre onde o suposto incidente aconteceu foi fornecida.

“O sr. Weinstein obviamente não pode falar sobre alegações anônimas, mas nega categoricamente alegações de sexo não-consensual”, disse sua porta-voz, Sallie Hofmeister, em comunicado.

A medida vem após acusações feitas por diversas mulheres de que Weinstein as assediou ou agrediu sexualmente em incidentes que remontam aos anos 1980, publicadas pelo jornal New York Times e pela revista New Yorker, no início deste mês.

A Reuters não conseguiu confirmar de maneira independente nenhuma das alegações. Weinstein, de 65 anos, negou ter tido sexo não-consensual com qualquer pessoa.

Na semana passada, o departamento de polícia de Nova York disse estar investigando uma alegação de agressão sexual que teria sido cometida por Weinstein em 2004.

Na quinta-feira, o jornal Los Angeles Times disse que a alegação feita ao departamento de polícia de Los Angeles partiu de uma modelo e atriz italiana conhecida, mas não identificada, que contou a detetives que Weinstein a estuprou em um quarto de um hotel em Beverly Hills após um evento em fevereiro de 2013.

Maiberger disse não pode verificar os detalhes sobre a suposta vítima ou sobre o incidente relatados pelo Los Angeles Times, mas disse que uma investigação ativa está em andamento.

The LAPD robbery and homicide division interviewed a potential sexual assault victim, spokesman Kevin Maiberger told Reuters. No further information was given on who made the allegations or where the alleged incident occurred.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex,” his spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said in an emailed statement.

The move follows allegations reported earlier this month by The New York Times and The New Yorker from a number of women that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

The New York Police Department said last week it was investigating an allegation of sexual assault from 2004 against Weinstein.

The Los Angeles Times newspaper said Thursday that the allegation made to the LAPD came from an unnamed well-known Italian model and actress, who told police detectives that Weinstein raped her in a room at a Beverly Hills hotel after a film event in February 2013.

Maiberger said he could not verify the details reported by the Los Angeles Times of the alleged victim or the incident, but said an active investigation was under way.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - XPO Logistics Inc said on Friday it is hiring more than 6,000 seasonal workers for the crucial peak holiday season, roughly 20 percent more than last year, as the third-largest publicly traded U.S. logistics company gears up for a surge in e-commerce deliveries.

XPO’s previously undisclosed plans reflect higher expectations for shipping demand for the holiday rush, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January.

The low U.S. jobless rate heading into peak this year poses a challenge for XPO and other major logistics and shipping companies, such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc, which must add thousands of temporary workers to handle as much as twice their normal package volumes.

XPO is a big player in e-commerce deliveries through its contract logistics and “last-mile” services for heavy goods, with a North American supply chain workforce of roughly 26,000 employees across 388 sites.

“E-commerce is the most exciting dynamic in the logistics industry,” Troy Cooper, XPO’s chief operating officer, told Reuters. “We’re constantly in recruiting mode, and we’re ramping that up for the holiday peak.”

Shoppers this year will shell out more on holiday gifting, according to industry surveys, buoyed by a labor market that is churning out more jobs every month, rising home prices and stock markets hovering at record highs.

Deloitte Consulting predicts sales of $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, with e-commerce sales jumping 18 percent to 21 percent.

FedEx expects to add more than 50,000 positions and offer extra hours to some current staff, while UPS said it would add 95,000 seasonal workers.

Seasonal hiring plans also give a glimpse into retailers’ holiday sales expectations as the companies make nearly a third of their annual sales during the period.

Amazon.com Inc said it would hire 120,000 workers in the U.S. this season, same as last year, joining a list of U.S. retailers cautious about their hiring plans amid an improving job market. [L4N1MN4RQ] [L4N1M142T]

Jamaica or bust: Merkel starts crunch coalition talks

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel pronounced herself optimistic as she opened the first full round of talks on piecing together the three-way “Jamaica” coalition she needs if she is to avoid an abrupt end to her 12 years in power.
Angela Merkel, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), arrives at the German Parliamentary Society offices before the start of exploratory talks about forming a new coalition government in Berlin, Germany, October 20, 2017.
The tricky three-way pact, dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition because the three parties’ colors - black, yellow and green - match those of the Jamaican flag, is untried at national level.
Daniel Guenther, conservative premier of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, said Germans had a “huge interest” in Merkel leading Germany for another four years.
If she cannot clinch a three-way coalition pact, Merkel could try to form a minority government, or else call fresh elections - an unprecedented scenario.

The talks between Merkel’s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens are styled as “exploratory”, but negotiators aim to get down to details of tax and budget policy in their first full meeting together.

The tricky three-way pact, dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition because the three parties’ colors - black, yellow and green - match those of the Jamaican flag, is untried at national level.

Merkel, weakened by a surging far-right in last month’s national election, needs to make the awkward alliance fly as her previous “grand coalition” partners - the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - say they want to rebuild in opposition after their worst election result in more than half a century.

“There will be many differences,” she said on her arrival at the Berlin talks, adding: “There is readiness on my side to think about this creatively.”

The outcome of the talks is keenly awaited both at home and across Europe, with many fretting that on crucial issues like euro zone governance reform the bloc is rudderless as its longest-serving leader forges a new alliance.

The chancellor told reporters after a two-day EU summit in Brussels that big decisions on the future of the euro zone would have to wait for the formation of the new government in Berlin.

Merkel has been able to steer Europe through its euro zone and refugee crises in part due to her dominance at home. Now that dominance is waning - her conservatives last month had their weakest election showing since 1949.

An Infratest Dimap poll for ARD showed 83 percent of Germans wanted the parties to find a compromise deal.

“CENTRIFUGAL FORCES”

“The chancellor knows that she must lead ‘Jamaica’ to success. Otherwise the centrifugal forces in the CDU will become uncontrollable,” business daily Handelsblatt wrote in an editorial headlined: “Jamaica as last chance for Merkel.”

Arriving at talks alongside Horst Seehofer, leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, Merkel was unable to mask the deep fractures within her own conservative camp.

“We want a stable government for our country,” Seehofer said, repeating his call for a strict upper limit on refugee numbers that Merkel has consistently opposed.

Some conservatives are starting to look towards a post-Merkel era. Daniel Guenther, conservative premier of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, said Germans had a “huge interest” in Merkel leading Germany for another four years.

“But they also want to see how things will proceed afterwards,” he told Focus magazine.

Merkel, 63, has suffered two further setbacks since the national election: the CDU was defeated in a regional election in Lower Saxony on Sunday, and the party’s premier in the eastern state of Saxony resigned on Wednesday, saying younger, fresher leadership was needed to revitalize the conservatives.

Should the three party groups fail to form a coalition, some in their ranks fear this could lead to public disenchantment and fuel further support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time last month.

If she cannot clinch a three-way coalition pact, Merkel could try to form a minority government, or else call fresh elections - an unprecedented scenario.

Alternatively, she could try to team up with the SPD. The Social Democrats reject that scenario, though senior party official Thomas Oppermann has indicated they could reconsider on one condition: Merkel steps aside.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Business Secretary Greg Clark will hold talks in Canada on Friday to discuss Airbus SE’s plans to buy a majority stake in Bombardier’s C-Series jetliner program aimed at helping it avoid high U.S. import tariffs.

Clark will meet with Canadian government officials and executives from the two manufacturers, according to a spokeswoman for the ministry for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

A deal announced earlier this week gives Airbus (AIR.PA) a controlling stake in the Canadian manufacturer’s troubled C-Series jets, which are partly made in Northern Ireland.

The tie up gives Bombardier (BBDb.TO) a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N), in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose 300 percent import duties, potentially threatening thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.

Under the deal, Airbus would take a 50.01 percent stake in the C Series and add an assembly line for the plane in Alabama, thus becoming a U.S.-made product so it can avoid anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.

The Boeing-Bombardier dispute has snowballed into a bigger multilateral trade dispute, with British Prime Minister Theresa May wading into the debate and asking U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene in order save British jobs.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, which is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four nations and remains mired in political sensitivities after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.

Clark and Northern Irish politicians had welcomed the Airbus deal and promised to work with the firms to protect the workforce in the province. Bombardier makes the C-Series CS100 and CS300 state-of-the-art carbon wings at a plant in Belfast.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and eight others injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital, two security sources said on Friday.

The sources said authorities were following a lead to an apartment thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and policemen since last year.

The suspected militants fled after the exchange of fire there, the sources said.

Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.

An Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule.

The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including Egypt’s Christian Copts.

However, it is the finance ministry that appoints people to the BoE’s monetary, financial and prudential regulation policy committees.

“The Treasury must make all efforts to encourage as diverse range of candidates for the Bank’s policy committees as possible,” said lawmaker Nicky Morgan, chair of parliament’s Treasury Committee.

She added that the finance ministry has been asked to confirm that its recruitment processes fit with a remit of achieving greater diversity of public appointments, including from ethnic minorities.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - O presidente Michel Temer admitiu, em entrevista ao site Poder 360 publicada nesta sexta-feira, que a reforma da Previdência poderá ficar restrita à idade mínima de 62 anos para mulheres e 65 anos para homens, à regra de transição e ao fim das diferenças entre o sistema público e privado.

Na conversa, da qual participaram também os ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, e da Secretaria de Governo, Antonio Imbassahy, Temer afirmou que se transição e idade mínima forem aprovados pelo Congresso, “já estaria de bom tamanho”.

Padilha acrescentou, então, a necessidade do corte de privilégios aos servidores, afirmando que esses três itens preservariam 75 por cento da reforma planejada pelo governo.

O presidente ainda admitiu, na entrevista, que não sabe se o governo terá condições de levar adiante a reforma, mesmo limitada, ainda em 2017, como pretendia.

“O ideal é que isso seja aprovado neste ano. Agora, eu faço mais uma ressalva aqui, para tirar qualquer pretensão. Temos de consultar as bancadas novamente, como foi feito na primeira vez. Na primeira vez estava tudo ajustado para aprovar, não fosse uma certa irresponsabilidade denunciativa”, disse Temer, fazendo referência à primeira denúncia apresentada contra ele pelo ex-procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, em junho.

“Então, vamos fazer uma nova avaliação e verificar se é possível ou não. E tentar aprovar este ano”, acrescentou.

O presidente disse ainda que poderá enviar o pacote de medidas de ajuste fiscal, com que a equipe econômica conta para fechar o orçamento, por projeto de lei, e não por medida provisória. Entre os temas estão a suspensão do reajuste dos servidores, a elevação da contribuição previdenciária dos servidores de 11 por cento para 14 por cento e a equiparação do modelo de tributação dos fundos fechados de investimento com o dos fundos abertos.

“Se acontecer o que aconteceu agora com o projeto referente ao Banco Central (sobre acordos de leniência), aprovado praticamente em um ou dois dias, pode ser via projeto de lei”, afirmou Temer. “Se isso acontecer, posso até mandar o projeto de lei. Se houver dificuldade, aí sou obrigado a me utilizar da medida provisória”.

Temer disse ainda “não ser improvável” que edite uma MP prorrogando mais uma vez a adesão ao Refis. Segundo o presidente, vai haver vetos no projeto, mas esses ainda não estão definidos. O governo tem até 3 de novembro para sancionar o projeto, mas a adesão é apenas até o final deste mês.

TRABALHO ESCRAVO

Temer ainda confirmou informações publicadas na quinta-feira pela Reuters de que estuda modificações sugeridas pela procuradora-geral da República, Raquel Dodge, na portaria que alterou a definição de trabalho escravo, mas que a norma não deve ser suspensa.

“A portaria é do ministro do Trabalho. Mas ainda hoje ele falou comigo e já esteve duas vezes com a dra. Raquel Dodge”, disse. “Ele esteve duas vezes com ela e recebeu sugestões que ela fez. Ele está examinando as sugestões. É muito provável que incorpore várias”.

As modificações, segundo o presidente, seriam feitas através de uma nova portaria. Uma deles, contou, pode ser a criação de uma delegacia da Polícia Federal para trabalho escravo no Ministério da Justiça.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Unidentified men threw a grenade into a laborers’ hostel in the Pakistani port of Gwadar wounding 26 of them, police said on Friday, in an attack likely to raise concern about security for the Pakistani section of China’s “Belt and Road” initiative.

There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, one of three on Thursday in the gas-rich southwestern province of Baluchistan, a key section of the plan for energy and transport links connecting western China with the Middle East and Europe.

“They laborers were having dinner at the hostel when motorcyclists attacked them with a grenade,” police official Imam Bakhsh told Reuters.

Separatist rebels in Baluchistan, fighting against what they see as the unfair exploitation of the province’s resources, have for years attacked energy and infrastructure projects, including the Gwadar deep-sea port on the Arabian Sea.

Islamist militants also operate in Baluchistan, which shares borders with both Afghanistan and Iran.

Security officials have said that militants trying to disrupt construction of the Chinese economic corridor through Pakistan have killed more than 50 Pakistani workers since 2014.

Pakistan has assured China that it can provide security for the $57 billion worth of projects that it plans.

In the other attacks, a grenade attack at a food court in the town of Mastung, 55 km (35 miles) from the provincial capital of Quetta, wounded 15 people, a police official said.

In the third attack, gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire at paramilitary soldiers killing one and wounding four in the west of the province.

On Wednesday, a suicide car-bomber rammed a police bus in Quetta killing five policemen and two passers-by. The Pakistani Taliban claimed that attack.

A suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State at a Sufi Muslim shrine in Baluchistan this month killed 22 people and wounded more than 30.

Asian funds GIC of Singapore and CIC of China made all the running.

According to Thomson Reuters data, SWFs participated in deals worth just $14.1 billion, down from a revised $28.3 billion April-June, even though the number of deals rose to 38 from 31 quarter-on-quarter.

The second quarter’s total, however, was swollen by China Investment Corp’s (CIC) whopping $13.7 billion acquisition of warehouse firm Logicor, Europe’s biggest ever private equity real estate deal.

In a continuation of the previous quarter’s trend, CIC and GIC remained the most acquisitive funds, with CIC involved in 14 deals and GIC 10.

“The sovereign funds that are active are those that are generating current account trade surpluses,” said Michael Power, a strategist at Investec Asset Management.

In contrast, the oil-backed funds have been less acquisitive in recent quarters, reflecting the constraints imposed by persistent low oil prices.

Markus Massi, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, said another reason for the dominance of the Asian funds was that they had specialist teams looking for deals.

FILE PHOTO: People pass the skyline of Singapore October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su - File Photo

“The Asians are actively going out and scouting. If you’re a private equity company and you want to close a deal, it’s easier to go to someone who already has the knowledge and capability on the other side.”

GIC participated in the top three deals, the largest being a $6.4 billion offer for Danish payments processor Nets by newly-formed company Evergood 5. The deal was backed by a consortium that included GIC, led by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman.

The second largest was the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hong Kong-based insurer MassMutual Asia by another investor group that included GIC.

The rise in the number of consortium deals has gone hand-in-hand with ballooning deal sizes. “There is so much firepower available at the moment, you can go hunting for larger assets,” said Massi.

GIC also led a $220 million funding round for Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform Dianrong.

Power said the barriers to entry for most financial services were falling so sovereign funds needed to protect their portfolios by diversifying into the new players.

“It’s the tech-driven disruptors that are starting to redefine what financial services means,” he said.

Eight of CIC’s investments were in healthcare, a hotly-sought after area, and two in real estate. This followed last quarter’s Logicor buy and CIC’s involvement in the consortium that bought InterPark, the largest owner-operator of parking infrastructure in the United States.

This time GIC clinched the biggest real estate deal, taking a stake in the property rental unit of India’s DLF.

O presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, havia dito que não estava com pressa para fechar um acordo com os países exportadores de carne do Mercosul --Brasil, Argentina, Paraguai e Uruguai-- e conseguiu incluir o comércio na agenda de uma cúpula de líderes da União Europeia em Bruxelas.

“Nós tivemos um pequeno momento logo depois da meia-noite para discutir comércio internacional”, disse o presidente da Comissão Europeia, Jean-Claude Juncker, em coletiva de imprensa após encontro dos líderes nesta sexta-feira.

Juncker disse que a Europa tem uma grande oportunidade de fechar acordos comerciais com países pelo mundo, respeitando os valores e padrões europeus e a “reciprocidade buscada pelo presidente francês”.

“Nós continuaremos a fazer tudo que pudermos para concluir as negociações com o Mercosul antes do final do ano. É importante. Nós subestimamos a importância do Mercosul para a União Europeia”, disse.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run petroleum firm PDVSA has been barred from using a NuStar Energy (NS.N) oil storage terminal in the Caribbean over $26 million in unpaid bills, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, halting delivery of a cargo to an oil trader.
The suspension comes months after PDVSA had expanded its NuStar storage contract following a payment dispute with Buckeye Partners (BPL.N) over a Bahamas storage facility.
On Oct. 10, after receiving no response from the Venezuelan firm, NuStar sent a $287,500 invoice to Sigma Navigation, a unit of Sovcomflot.
Trafigura’s attempts to obtain the oil first were delayed due to force majeure declared by NuStar due to Hurricane Irma, and later over the unpaid bills between PDVSA and NuStar.
PDVSA has not yet paid the October installment, according to a PDVSA source, prompting NuStar’s refusal to load.

The suspension was triggered when PDVSA missed a payment for use of NuStar’s Statia facility on the island of St. Eustatius, according to company documents viewed by Reuters.

“We should not load this cargo,” wrote NuStar Vice President James Calvert in response to a loading request, according to one document.

NuStar’s refusal to retrieve the oil over what amounts to nearly a year’s worth of monthly fees shows how recurring legal and trade disputes are disrupting PDVSA’s ability to deliver its oil to foreign customers, which generate more than 90 percent of the country’s export revenue.

Shipping delays and quality concerns also are jeopardizing the OPEC-member country’s crude sales, the lifeblood of its troubled economy.

The suspension comes months after PDVSA had expanded its NuStar storage contract following a payment dispute with Buckeye Partners (BPL.N) over a Bahamas storage facility. Both U.S. firms operate key transit hubs for companies that move oil through the Caribbean.

NuStar declined to comment. PDVSA did not respond to a request to comment.

NuStar’s refusal and other details of PDVSA’s payment problems emerged after trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] sought to load a cargo of Venezuelan oil held at Statia. Trafigura was the winner of a court-ordered auction of the heavy crude intended to help resolve a separate billing dispute between PDVSA and units of Russian state-run conglomerate Sovcomflot (IPO-SKF.MM).

Trafigura declined to comment on the auction or whether it expects to receive the cargo. Sovcomflot also declined to comment.

NuStar first sought fees for the stored oil from PDVSA. On Oct. 10, after receiving no response from the Venezuelan firm, NuStar sent a $287,500 invoice to Sigma Navigation, a unit of Sovcomflot. NuStar offered to allow the oil to be loaded by Oct. 20 if payment was made before that date.

That request led to a series of exchanges between representatives of the three companies. In one, a law firm representing Sigma alerted PDVSA’s lawyers that its client was willing to pay the NuStar bill but reserved the right to seek repayment as part of the broader claim, according to documents.

Sigma’s lawyers also revealed in emails that, according to its talks with NuStar, the U.S. firm was claiming PDVSA owed it another $26 million for accumulated unpaid Statia storage fees.

LONG TRIP

The tangled story of the oil cargo at the heart of the dispute began a year ago, when PDVSA sent 550,000 barrels of crude oil to St. Eustatius on tanker NS Columbus rented from Sovcomflot. The oil had been sold to Norway’s Statoil (STL.OL), which planned to retrieve it at Statia.

Before it could get there, Sovcomflot had a St. Maarten court freeze the delivery in hopes of collecting partial payment for shipping fees unpaid by PDVSA. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the court ordered the tanker to discharge its cargo at Statia.

Trafigura’s attempts to obtain the oil first were delayed due to force majeure declared by NuStar due to Hurricane Irma, and later over the unpaid bills between PDVSA and NuStar.

“We are facing a delay in the payment for the use of such facilities and related services contracted there. PDVSA is doing its best to catch up with outstanding debts, but has not made any special arrangements to cover the storage costs of the relevant tank,” a PDVSA official wrote in an email in October.

The PDVSA official explained that “since June no payment has been made to NuStar,” but also said that a payment schedule was proposed to the U.S. firm in a meeting in September in Caracas, with a first installment of $2.3 million planned for October.

According to the schedule, 10 percent of the accumulated debt was to be paid from October through December, with a one-time additional payment due in January and the remainder paid off through 10-percent monthly installments.

PDVSA has not yet paid the October installment, according to a PDVSA source, prompting NuStar’s refusal to load.

In a memorandum to PDVSA’s finance chief, Simon Zerpa, the oil company’s trade and supply department warned further payment delay to NuStar could result in possible tanker embargoes, broken supply contracts with Caribbean customers and a shortage of fuels for Venezuela’s domestic market.

In the September meeting, PDVSA suggested it could terminate a related contract with NuStar for fuel oil tanks rental and sublease a portion of its Statia storage to an undisclosed firm as a way to reduce further debts.

NuStar countered that PDVSA could pay off the debt with oil, or by allowing it to become a partner in the state-run company’s terminal on the island of Bonaire along with a partial payment to show good faith.

It is unclear if any agreement on topics different than the payment schedule was reached.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Thursday, breaking four days of gains, pressured by larger-than-expected product inventories in the United States and profit-taking after a recent run-up in markets.

Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 92 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $57.23 a barrel. The global benchmark is still about 30 percent above its mid-year levels.

U.S. light crude CLc1 settled down 75 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $51.29, but is still nearly 25 percent higher than June’s lows.

Ongoing tension in the Middle East has boosted prices, but analysts say those concerns may now be priced into the market.

“The geopolitical risk that came rushing into the market is starting to come out,” said John Kilduff, a partner at hedge fund Again Capital LLC.

Kurdish officials said thousands had fled the Kirkuk region fearing persecution since Iraqi armed forces retook it following a referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad.

Iraq said it expects to restore Kirkuk’s oil production to last week’s levels by Sunday.

Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) subsidiary in Nigeria, SPDC, lifted force majeure Thursday on Bonny Light crude oil exports.

Meanwhile, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it temporarily suspended oil and gas drilling activity in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Analysts said they have seen some profit-taking after two weeks of gains. Energy equities (XLE) were also weaker, falling to 3-1/2-week lows.

U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide further action against Tehran. That could imply the resumption of sanctions against Iran, which reduced supply by about 1 million bpd during the previous round.

However, it is unlikely the United States will get the same level of cooperation from other countries as it did when it previously sanctioned Iran.

Analysts said crude supply should keep tightening if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners, including Russia, agree an expected extension to their deal to curb production.

The market turned bearish on Wednesday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a surprise drop in U.S. refining rates and an unexpected build in fuel stocks last week that signaled slower demand in the world’s top oil consumer. [EIA/S]

The fuel build overshadowed a 5.7 million-barrel slump in U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA and an 11-percent tumble in crude output last week to 8.4 million barrels per day (bpd) as production was shut in by Hurricane Nate.

(Reuters) - The world’s top two oilfield services firms warned on Friday of a challenging fourth quarter for the industry, as investment slows due to soft oil prices and energy firms reducing activity on offshore rigs.

FILE PHOTO: The exterior of the Schlumberger Corporation headquarters building is pictured in the Galleria area of Houston January 16, 2015. REUTERS/Richard Carson/File Photo

Shares of Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) dropped nearly 5 percent to a 21-month low of $61.41, while Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) tumbled 5.2 percent to a 16-month low of $31.44. Halliburton Co (HAL.N), scheduled to report on Monday, was little changed.

Last year, as oil prices bounced off multi-year lows hit at the start of 2016, optimism began to creep back into the energy industry. But after rising about 50 percent last year, Brent crude prices LCOc1 have barely budged this year, up a shade over 1 percent, which has again led to caution in the industry.

Schlumberger said investments in North America were moderating as energy companies increasingly shied away from chasing higher production at the cost of financial returns.

“In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity continued to weaken in the third quarter, and the outlook remains bleak for this region based on current customer plans,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said.

Kibsgaard said he expects the rate of growth in North America to slow and that market estimates for the fourth quarter, as they stand, are “potentially on the high end.”

Baker Hughes’ CEO Lorenzo Simonelli was even more pessimistic, and forecast the overall oil and gas environment to remain challenging for the rest of the year.

“We have seen some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments.”

The dour outlooks come as U.S. oil producers are under pressure to boost shareholder returns after 2017 spending increases ran into flattish oil prices, knocking share prices back after a run up last year.

This summer, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess Corp (HES.N) cut second-half capital spending plans, including on oilfield services activities, due to weaker-than-expected U.S. crude prices CLc1.

The sub-$55 prices have also weighed on offshore exploration and driven a new round of consolidation among drillers in a bid to tame excess capacity and get price increases.

A recent survey by Deloitte showed most top U.S. oil executives see prices remaining below $60 per barrel through 2018 and not hitting $70 until at least the next decade.

Baker Hughes, in its first report to include GE Co’s (GE.N) oil and gas business since their merger, reported a third-quarter profit that missed analysts estimates by a wide margin.

Schlumberger, however, matched analysts’ profit estimates and posted a 43 percent jump in business from North America.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North American department of North Korea’s foreign ministry, told a non-proliferation conference in Moscow Washington would “have to put up” with North Korea’s nuclear status, RIA reported.

“This is a matter of life and death for us. The current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack.”

“We will respond to fire with fire.”

Pyongyang would regard any attempts to strangle the country via U.N. Security Council sanctions as an attempt “to declare war”.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing the same conference earlier on Friday, urged world powers to get behind a joint Russian-Chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over North Korea’s weapons program.

“We are convinced that its implementation will promote the lessening of military activity and tension on the Korean peninsula and the forming in Northeastern Asia of a system of equal and indivisible security,” he said.

The plan proposes a moratorium on North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons tests, while South Korea and the United States suspend holding military exercises.

“The main task at the current stage is to prevent a military conflict which will inevitably lead to a large-scale humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,” Lavrov said. “All the sides involved should exercise restraint.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - U.S. home solar companies, believing President Donald Trump will soon slap tariffs on imported panels and make their systems more expensive, are using that threat to juice their slowing sales.

FILE PHOTO: Solar electric panels are shown installed on the roof of the Hanover Olympic building, the first building to offer individual solar-powered net-zero apartments in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Top independent installer Sunrun Inc (RUN.O) and smaller rivals, many of which are part of an aggressive industry lobbying effort opposed to new tariffs on panels, are warning homeowners considering going solar to sign up before tariffs cause prices to rise.

On its web site, Sunrun warns visitors that panel prices could double in 2018, raising the cost of an average installation by $3,000.

“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.

Smaller, local installers and solar advocates from California to Massachusetts are also raising the prospect of higher prices at sales consultations, in blog posts and at community events like farmer’s markets.

“We are really urging people not to wait until 2018,” said Craig Forman, who leads a pro-solar community group in Newton, Massachusetts, that refers interested residents to two local solar contractors.

The marketing strategy comes at a time when the U.S. residential solar industry is in a slump. The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.

There are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term. In the third quarter, the number of new U.S. solar permits issued fell 11 percent from the previous year, though that was an improvement from the 24 percent and 16 percent drops in the first and second quarters, according to OhmHome, an online resource for consumers interested in going solar.

In California, the No. 1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.

In April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.

Solar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.

The residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.

Nevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually. For sales processes that can take up to a year from when a homeowner first inquires about going solar, the trade case is giving potential customers a palpable reason to act now.

“Installers are looking for any reason to get back in touch with the customer and a sense of urgency that will make their sales process be shorter,” Aggarwal said.

Not all installers are talking about the trade case. Tesla, for instance, said it is awaiting the final outcome of the case before alerting potential customers.

Gigawatt Inc, a Placentia, California-based company that installs systems under the name GoGreenSolar.com, has seen a “spike” in sales since it began talking to customers about the trade case, according to CEO Deep Patel.

“In the consumers’ mind prices are going to go down. Cell phones got cheaper, TVs got cheaper,” said Patel. “The last thing you want to do is tell them ‘Hey, Mr Smith, the project costs went up a couple of grand.'”

(SOUNDBITE) (English) NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, SAYING: "All of the economic incentives put together, from the city and the state, would realize $7 billion in potential credits against Amazon's state and city taxes, and still it would be an economic benefit for the state, which the Economic Development Authority estimates at over $9 billion in economic benefit to the State of New Jersey." Across the Hudson River, New York City made a proposal without any incentives. But New York state is expected to offer some, according to a spokesman for the city's economic development corporation. Across the country, California throwing in $300 million plus other extras. Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale. (SOUNDBITE) DANIELLE HALE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, REALTOR.COM (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The city that we thought could potentially benefit the most from Amazon coming in from a housing market perspective would be Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's large enough that Amazon wouldn't cause it to become a one company town. Its housing market is doing well, but has enough capacity to welcome in additional workers without being, you know, too overloaded from an inventory shortage perspective. The market is appreciating, but not on the same order of other cities that are increasing at double digits." Moody's says Austin is the most likely winner. The city has an impressive work force, low costs of doing business and a good quality of life. It's also the headquarters of the retailer Amazon bought recently, Whole Foods Market. Amazon will announce its decision for its second campus next year.

Michael Bapis of Bapis Group at HighTower: SOUNDBITE: MICHAEL BAPIS, PARTNER, BAPIS GROUP AT HIGHTOWER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "People are getting nervous. The sentiment's the highest it's been since the 2000 levels. Earnings are moving in the right direction. Ironically, jobless claims were the lowest they've been since 1973. So I think it's like a push-pull. People are wondering where are we going to settle in these markets." Apple shares dropped amid signs of poor demand for the iPhone 8. The CEO of Canada's largest mobile network said appetite for the phone had been "anemic". Also declining: United Airlines and other airline stocks. Flight cancellations caused by hurricanes slammed United's quarterly profit. Verizon shares surged higher. The carrier added more phone subscribers than expected in the latest quarter. Two bright signs on the labor front: The number of Americans filing jobless claims fell to its lowest level in nearly 45 years. Factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region rose to a record high in October. In Europe, political upheaval in Spain and disappointing earnings from Unilever and Publicis pulled the markets lower.

Strong sales of SK-II skincare products in Asia made Procter & Gamble's quarterly profit look better, but it couldn't mask tepid quarterly sales. Sales overall inched up just 1 percent and missed analysts' forecasts. Cutting into that growth: a 22 percent sales drop in its grooming business despite cutting prices. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi, who believes P&G shares are overvalued, said, "Grooming was especially weak." P&G's shares dropped at the market open Friday, chipping into their nearly 9 percent gain this year. Profit rose and beat forecasts. Making the biggest contribution to the bottom line: higher sales of fabric softeners and laundry detergents like Tide and Febreze. The results come just one week after activist investor Nelson Peltz narrowly lost his bid for a board seat at P&G in a historic proxy battle. He had pushed for a re-organization, saying the company was losing market share because of what he called its "suffocating bureaucracy." Looking ahead, P&G said it's sticking to its full-year sales and profit forecasts.

The migrant route from Libya into Europe is one of the most heavily used, but also one of the most dangerous. These migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean last week. They say they've been lucky to dodge increased sea and police patrols. Last month, Reuters reported that an armed group was also stopping departures from Sabratha in Libya, a key springboard for smugglers. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MIGRANT FROM SIERRA LEONE, BUBA, SAYING: "Let me say it's a chance of luck. If you are lucky you make it. If you are unlucky they will karabouche you because there's plenty of ships." Slang for the various forces trying to stop the boats, the karabouche are accused of jailing migrants and then asking for money in order to free them. Some migrants say they have also suffered abuse while in detention. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MIGRANT FROM NIGERIA, AMBU, SAYING: "So every morning they would bring us out and beat us, flog us, with diverse type of punishment for we to call for our money. They gave food to call our people. While calling our people they would be beating us so we would cry so our people would hear our voice and know that, yes, we are suffering there." Italy has led European Union efforts to stop the flow of migrants from Libya to Europe. That has seen a twenty percent drop in arrivals in Italy this year, down to just over 100,000. But many charities say the EU plan isn't working. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MSF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS OFFICER ONBOARD THE SHIP AQUARIUS, NOOR CORNELISSEN SAYING: "You really have this sense of people being kicked around from one place to the next and unable to escape out of that. Doesn't matter how much ransom they are paying, doesn't matter who they are meeting along the journey. A lot of people, they perhaps leave their home country being smuggled but become trafficked along the way." These migrants lucky to escape detention. But many of those who are sent back will just keep trying, no matter how dangerous the journey.

(Reuters) - Tiger economies and competition from China will undoubtedly be forces to reckon with, but anyone looking to find the most influential research leading to the most transformative technologies should look West, not East. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

With 3,500 homes and businesses incinerated, the so-called North Bay fires also rank among the most destructive in state history. The fires have scorched more than 190,000 acres (77,000 hectares), an area nearly the size of New York City, reducing whole neighbourhoods in the city of Santa Rosa to grey ash and smouldering ruins dotted with charred trees and burned-out cars. The official cause of the disaster was under investigation, but officials said power lines toppled by gale-force winds on Sunday night may have sparked the conflagration. A resurgence of extreme wind conditions that had been forecast for Wednesday night and early Thursday failed to materialise, giving fire crews a chance to start carving containment lines around the perimeter of some of the blazes. But fierce winds were expected to return across much of the state as early as Friday night, and a force of 8,000 firefighters in Northern California were racing to reinforce and extend buffer lines before then, officials said.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Speaking as a folksy physician running for Virginia governor, Democrat Ralph Northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight Donald Trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.

But Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.

The balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.

He is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

The Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.

After denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.

“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.

Most polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.

Former Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.

A recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.

Distain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.

Yet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.

“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.

The Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.

Northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.

“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.

The strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

She said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.

“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.

Gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.

Vice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.

Democratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.

She admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.

“Lieutenant Governor Northam has done a wonderful job of talking about Trump without mentioning Trump,” she said.

Following an extended spell of rehabilitation, Steyn said he has finally recovered from the shoulder problem he suffered while bowling against Australia during last November’s test series.

“My arm is perfect, if anything its stronger than it was before because it’s (been) reinforced with a pin,” the 34-year-old told ESPNcricinfo.

“It’s 100 percent now. I’ve just got to start reminding myself how to bowl at high speeds because I haven’t done it for a year.”

Steyn is particularly excited to work under Ottis Gibson, the former fast bowler who is now South Africa’s new head coach.

“It’s the first time in my career I have had a head coach who was a bowler,” he added.

“It gets me excited because he (Gibson) is on the same wavelength as us. For the first time its also great to see that the head coach is out in the middle when the bowlers are bowling and not in the nets with the batters.”

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce said on Thursday it had begun an investigation into whether imports of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resin from India and China were being dumped on the U.S. market.

The department said it was also initiating a countervailing duty (CVD) investigation to determine whether producers of PTFE resin in India are receiving unfair subsidies.

These investigations were initiated based on petitions filed by the Chemours Company on Sept. 28.

According to the petition filed by Chemors, the estimated alleged dumping margins ranged from 23.4 percent to 408.9 percent for China, and 15.8 to 128.1 percent for India, the Commerce Department said in a statement.

It said unfair subsidies to India were substantial enough to investigate.

The Commerce Department estimated that in 2016, imports of PTFE resin from China was valued at $24.6 million and India at $14.3 million.

The department “will act swiftly, while assuring a full and fair assessment of the facts, to ensure that everyone trades on a level playing field”, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said it had launched an investigation into whether imports of another resin, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), from Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Pakistan and Taiwan were being dumped in the U.S. market.

Solar installers press homeowners to buy ahead of tariff

“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.
There are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term.
1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year.
Solar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.
Not all installers are talking about the trade case.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - U.S. home solar companies, believing President Donald Trump will soon slap tariffs on imported panels and make their systems more expensive, are using that threat to juice their slowing sales.

FILE PHOTO: Solar electric panels are shown installed on the roof of the Hanover Olympic building, the first building to offer individual solar-powered net-zero apartments in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Top independent installer Sunrun Inc (RUN.O) and smaller rivals, many of which are part of an aggressive industry lobbying effort opposed to new tariffs on panels, are warning homeowners considering going solar to sign up before tariffs cause prices to rise.

On its web site, Sunrun warns visitors that panel prices could double in 2018, raising the cost of an average installation by $3,000.

“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.

Smaller, local installers and solar advocates from California to Massachusetts are also raising the prospect of higher prices at sales consultations, in blog posts and at community events like farmer’s markets.

“We are really urging people not to wait until 2018,” said Craig Forman, who leads a pro-solar community group in Newton, Massachusetts, that refers interested residents to two local solar contractors.

The marketing strategy comes at a time when the U.S. residential solar industry is in a slump. The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.

There are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term. In the third quarter, the number of new U.S. solar permits issued fell 11 percent from the previous year, though that was an improvement from the 24 percent and 16 percent drops in the first and second quarters, according to OhmHome, an online resource for consumers interested in going solar.

In California, the No. 1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.

In April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.

Solar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.

The residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.

Nevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually. For sales processes that can take up to a year from when a homeowner first inquires about going solar, the trade case is giving potential customers a palpable reason to act now.

“Installers are looking for any reason to get back in touch with the customer and a sense of urgency that will make their sales process be shorter,” Aggarwal said.

Not all installers are talking about the trade case. Tesla, for instance, said it is awaiting the final outcome of the case before alerting potential customers.

Gigawatt Inc, a Placentia, California-based company that installs systems under the name GoGreenSolar.com, has seen a “spike” in sales since it began talking to customers about the trade case, according to CEO Deep Patel.

“In the consumers’ mind prices are going to go down. Cell phones got cheaper, TVs got cheaper,” said Patel. “The last thing you want to do is tell them ‘Hey, Mr Smith, the project costs went up a couple of grand.'”

The Eindhoven University of Technology team printed 800 layers of concrete for the design and spooled steel wire through the 3D printer on top of each layer to reinforce it. The bridge, made of six sections, was glued together and lifted into place on site.

Ending Iran nuclear deal would worsen North Korea situation: Kerry

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump risks driving Iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with North Korea if Washington ends a nuclear deal with Tehran, former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said late on Thursday.
FILE PHOTO: Secretary of State John Kerry speaks at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology and Education in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, January 13, 2017.
The nuclear deal places Iran under tough restraints, including inspections, round-the-clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced, Kerry said.
If Iran violated the accord, U.N. sanctions would snap back into place, Kerry told the audience.
“So the scenario that Trump opens up by saying ‘let’s get rid of the deal’ is actually proliferation, far more damaging and dangerous,” Kerry said.

Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance with it, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

“If you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,” Kerry said.

He was speaking in a private lecture delivered at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.

“And secondly, screw around with the deal that has already been made because the message is, don’t make a deal with the United States, they won’t keep their word,” he said.

The nuclear deal places Iran under tough restraints, including inspections, round-the-clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced, Kerry said. “We would notice an uptick in their enrichment, like that,” he said, snapping his fingers.

“And nobody that I know of with common sense can understand what the virtue is in accelerating a confrontation with the possibility that they might decide they want to break out and make it (a nuclear bomb) now instead of 10 or 15 or 25 years from now.”

Kerry, a former Senator who headed the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Swiss media that Trump’s leaving the Iranian deal’s fate to Congress was “very dangerous” and opened the door to “party politics”.

Congress cannot unilaterally renegotiate a multilateral accord, the Geneva daily Le Temps quoted him as saying. “It is possible that Congress would make an unreasonable decision that would put Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a very complicated political situation that could force him to retaliate. It’s a slippery slope.”

Khamenei said on Wednesday that Tehran would stick to its accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

If Iran violated the accord, U.N. sanctions would snap back into place, Kerry told the audience. “Moreover, at that point in time folks, we have a year of break-up. We have all the time that we need in the world to be able to bomb their facilities into submission.”

Ending the deal could lead to Iran hiding fissile production facilities “deep in a mountain where we have no insight”.

“So the scenario that Trump opens up by saying ‘let’s get rid of the deal’ is actually proliferation, far more damaging and dangerous,” Kerry said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled Brexit talks on Friday, with European Union leaders signaling their readiness to move the negotiations forward in the coming months.

But despite a more positive tone, a weakened May now faces a delicate political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without stoking a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from the talks.

EU leaders said at a summit in Brussels that they would begin preparations to move into “phase two” of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.

Yet they also made clear that May would have to move between now and the end of the year on settling a financial bill that EU officials have estimated at around 60 billion euros.

“I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit, saying movement on the financial settlement was crucial for progress in December.

French President Emmanuel Macron was tougher, saying the two sides had not yet completed even half of the work on the financial settlement and accusing Britain of “bluffing” by using the media to suggest there could be no deal.

“A lot is in the hands of Theresa May,” he said. An EU official said it took just 90 seconds for the 27 other leaders to adopt their Brexit conclusions at the end of the meeting, underlining how united they are.

May has said she cannot provide a specific financial pledge until she knows the shape of the future relationship. The EU is insisting that the two sides agree on an exit bill, the rights of EU citizens in a post-Brexit world and Irish border issues before delving into future ties.

Asked whether she had improved an offer of about 20 billion euros, May said she had repeated commitments she made in a speech in Italy last month, when she said the bloc would not be out of pocket when it came to its budget which runs until 2020.

“What I made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contributions... is that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plans ... and that we will honor the commitments that we have made during our membership,” she told a news conference before returning to Britain.

“Now there has to be detailed work on those commitments... we are going through them line by line and we will continue to go through them line by line.”

NO MOVEMENT YET

The final text from the EU-27 read: “The European Union ... notes that, while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.”

Still, the leaders held open the hope of reaching a deal at the next regular summit in December. And in a move that could save weeks of delay, they ordered EU negotiators to start preparing for what Brussels will want in a transition period.

Uncertainty over the final shape of a Brexit deal has unsettled businesses on both sides of the Channel.

Slideshow (17 Images)

Terry Scuoler, CEO of the British manufacturers’ association (EEF), welcomed the warmer words from EU leaders, but said industry needed “more than a hint of progress”.

All the EU leaders worked hard to strike a positive tone at the summit after May used a dinner late on Thursday to appeal to the other 27 leaders to help her silence critics at home by offering a signal that the talks would move on.

Many were upbeat and May struck up an animated and friendly conversation at the beginning of the summit with Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who are both seen in Britain as hardliners in the talks.

That might be enough for May to calm immediate concerns at home after Brexit campaigners urged the British prime minister to signal her readiness to leave the EU without a deal and to rely on World Trade Organization rules.

But she faces a major dilemma as she gears up for the next EU summit in December.

“The next eight weeks will be the most challenging for ... Theresa May and the most consequential for Brexit,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group.

The chair of the summit Donald Tusk said there would need to be a more positive narrative to reach a Brexit deal in December - a sentiment echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

“We have some details but we don’t have all the details we need,” he said. “It’s not my working assumption that we’ll have no deal.”

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A week after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a blistering speech about Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military and economic force in the Islamic Republic has shown it has no intention of curbing its activities in the Middle East.

In defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran’s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region.

A senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was “acting crazy” and was following U.S. strategy of increasing “the shadow of war in the region”.

Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

“In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.

“The IRGC can’t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don’t back down.”

The day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards’ al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq’s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum.

The niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month.

Other Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.

“I don’t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,” she said. “He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.”

LIGHTNING ASSAULT

Within days, Iran’s mostly Shi‘ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran’s hand in Iraq.

Commanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi‘ite-led Iraqi central government’s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied.

A video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi‘ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office.

Iran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism.

After the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran.

FRONT-LINE PLAYER

Regional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi‘ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,” said Khamenei. “Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.”

Speaking after Trump’s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: ”From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...

“Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.”

The ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months.

Small boats from the Revolutionary Guards’ navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares.

In August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official.

Some recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually.

During the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.

POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT

The Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi‘ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.

“The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi‘ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards.

In early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.

“This is the first time that we’ve seen it used in this area,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack.

Dozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military.

Asked about the threat posed by Shi‘ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump’s speech, Dillon said: “We’re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.”

Trump’s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards’ political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet.

Since becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards’ economic influence and involvement in political matters.

Now, Rouhani’s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump’s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. “What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,” said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.

The Sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable.

Sharif, 67, resigned in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.

Sharif said there was no precedent for indicting someone in his absence. “I hope I will get justice,” he told reporters in London in remarks broadcast by local Geo TV, adding that he would travel home to attend the next court hearing.

Judge Bashir Ahmad of the court that tries cases registered and investigated by an anti-graft body, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), indicted Sharif, his daughter Maryam Sharif and her husband, Muhammad Safdar. They all pleaded not guilty.

Maryam and Safdar were present in court, but Sharif, who was prime minister twice in the 1990s, sent a representative while he tends to his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment in Britain.

Maryam said in the court that the charges were unfounded and baseless.

“This will go down in history as a travesty of justice,” she said.

Outside the court, Maryam again hinted at military interference in the judicial process by saying the trial was “a repeat of 1999”, the year her father was toppled in a military coup led by former army chief Pervez Musharraf.

It is not clear if she was comparing the trial to the coup, or subsequent corruption accusations and investigations that Musharraf ordered into Sharif.

Sharif’s disqualification stemmed from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy posh flats in London.

The Supreme Court initially declined to dismiss Sharif but ordered an investigation into his family’s wealth.

A separate Supreme Court-appointed panel said the family’s wealth did not match its income, and accused Maryam and her brothers of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy the London flats.

After the probe, the top court disqualified Sharif and ordered the NAB to investigate and conduct a trial. Sharif denies ever receiving the small source of income that led to his disqualification.

The NAB has in the past been described as toothless because of its low conviction rates, especially when it comes to powerful politicians, and investigations that last many years.

But the Supreme Court has ordered the trial to be concluded within six months.

Opening arguments are due to begin on Oct. 26.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore-headquartered solar panel maker REC hopes to be exempt from potential U.S. restrictions on imports following a recent trade finding that said no significant injury to the United States had been caused by makers including those from Australia, Canada and Singapore.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce by early next year measures which his administration will take to limit imports after the U.S. International Trade Commission found in September that U.S. panel makers had been harmed by cheap imports.

Many companies have warned that a solar trade dispute involving potential import tariffs between the United States and other countries could cost thousands of jobs and slow down the development of the clean energy technology.

The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) in September found injury from imports from several countries with which it has free trade agreements (FTA), including Mexico and South Korea.

However, USITC said that “with respect to other FTA countries” including Canada, Australia or Singapore, there was “not a substantial cause of serious injury”.

Still, REC Chief Executive Steve O‘Neil said the industry was watching closely.

“We’re certainly paying a lot of attention to it. We will know more once the Trump administration makes their final ruling,” he told Reuters.

More than 90 percent of the world’s solar panel-making capacity is in Asia, with China accounting for 70 percent of the output followed by southeast Asia, O‘Neil said.

High costs, the lack of raw materials and infrastructure make it hard for U.S. solar panel producers to compete with those in Asia, forcing several U.S. solar makers into bankruptcy in the past years.

REC was founded in Norway but is headquartered in Singapore and majority-owned by China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) [CNNCC.UL].

The company has production capacity of 1.5 gigawatts (GW) and sells about half of its panels in the United States, 30 percent to Europe and the rest in Asia.

Despite the concentration in Asia, O‘Neil said the global solar market remained fragmented, with hundreds of panel makers competing and no single firm having a market share of more than 8 percent.

“We know consolidation is coming and maturing will happen, but right now, it’s still a race for scale, for technology, and to emerge as a winner in the solar-panel manufacturing end of the market.”

Rooftop solar is growing rapidly thanks to a near 30 percent drop in the cost of solar panels since 2016 and government policies that allow consumers to sell their excess solar power into the grid.

“This year we’ve tripled our sales in Australia,” O‘Neil said.

The world is expected to add up to 100 GW of solar power capacity this year that will bring the cumulative installed capacity to 300-350 GW, O‘Neil said.

Besides the United States, REC sees India, Europe and Southeast Asia as growing markets to tap, he said.

(For a graphic on 'World solar power capacity', click reut.rs/2l2ZvsX)

NEW TECHNOLOGIES

O‘Neil said there were several forms of experimental technologies with which the sector hoped to make further inroads.

It also includes finding ways to improve the performance of single panels.

O‘Neil said that off-grid solar power as well as hybrid systems, including working together with batteries were “getting some traction.”

Solar power is seen to have large potential in regions that are not connected to power grids, such as many of Southeast Asia’s remote islands.

So far, most of this back-up has been provided by diesel generators, but thanks to improving technology, batteries are being increasingly used.

“If you replace diesel in an island with a solar system, the payback is astounding,” O‘Neil said.

REC Solar has also participated in the testing of floating solar PV in Singapore’s Tengah reservoir as land-scarce countries explore options to tap on solar power, he said.

At 10:38 a.m. ET (1438 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 58.21 points, or 0.37 percent, to 15,876.21. It reached as high as 15,879.34, the highest level since Feb. 23.

Consumer staples, home to grocers and other food producers, was the only declining group among the index’s 10 key sectors, slipping 0.2 percent.

The retreat in consumer staples stocks come as retail sales data for August showed an unexpected fall, led by a 2.5 percent drop at food and beverage stores.

Financial stocks, which make up about a third of the index’s weight and can drive direction even when individual stock moves are modest, gained 0.5 percent. Canada’s four largest banks were among the top 10 most influential advancing stocks, with most making gains under 0.6 percent.

Canadian Pacific Railway extended its gains this week after reporting better than expected third-quarter profit late on Tuesday, and was up another 2.0 percent to C$225.35. Canadian National Railway advanced 0.7 percent to C$103.38. The overall industrials sector rose 0.8 percent.

The materials group, which includes mining and other resource firms, added 0.8 percent as nickel prices hit a six-week high and copper prices remained above $7,000 a tonne.

Teck Resources Ltd rallied 3.5 percent to C$28.76.

New Gold Inc jumped 5 percent to C$4.685 after Canaccord Genuity raised its rating and target price.

On the down side, Klondex Mines Ltd fell 8.9 percent to C$4.01 after the company reported third quarter production results.

DHX Media Ltd plunged 11.3 percent to C$4.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 159 to 83, for a 1.92-to-1 ratio on the upside.

The index was posting 15 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct. 19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels, reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts.

The move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn-states like Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and Valero Energy Corp who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief.

The letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months. The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul.

The most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said..

The so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said.

Pruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas.

Pruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies.

Those ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

But Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration’s promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers.

“It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,” Grassley said in a statement.

In the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog.

Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was “grateful for Administrator Pruitt’s epiphany on the road to the RFS.”

The program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a coalition of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program.

“If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,” Blair said.

Dark humor has dominated oil panels at Davos this year, notes Reuters energy editor Dmitry Zhdannikov, as industry leaders come to grips with plummeting crude prices.



At one panel, the president of major oil producer Azerbaijan — where protestors last week took to the streets over the collapse of the national currency — made a quip about OPEC meetings.

"Every time OPEC meets, the price goes down," President Ilham Aliyev.



"Therefore, we are very concerned about a possible new meeting. Maybe better not

to have it?" Aliyev humorously asked a panel with Aramco chairman Khalid al-Falih.

Just as the panel ended, another oil executive joked

on the sidelines: "I'm optimistic. Oil will soon cost $50. But

for two barrels."

Berlin (Reuters) - Als Horst Seehofer am Mittwochabend die ersten Gespräche mit den Grünen verließ, klang er wie ein Trophäensammler.

Leaders of the German Green Party Anton Hofreiter, Michael Kellner and Katrin Goering-Eckardt together with leaders of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) Christian Lindner and Wolfgang Kubicki are seen on the balcony of German Parliamentary Society offices prior to the exploratory talks with CDU/CSU about forming a new coalition government in Berlin, Germany, October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

“In meiner Sammlung der Koalitionen fehlt mir diese Jamaika-Koalition noch”, sagte der CSU-Chef. Und auch wenn dies scherzhaft gemeint war: Die erste, noch getrennte Runde von CDU/CSU mit FDP und dann den Grünen hat das Tor für eine Jamaika-Koalition zumindest so weit aufgestoßen, dass es den Beteiligten schwer fallen dürfte, nicht mehr hindurchzugehen. Daran ändert auch die Tatsache nichts, dass alle vier Parteien schon aus taktischen Gründen öffentlich betonen, die Auseinandersetzung über schwierige Sachthemen stehe noch bevor. Inhaltliche Stolpersteine gibt es tatsächlich genug. Aber mit dem Mittwoch ist nach Ansicht von Politikern mehrerer Parteien der Erfolgsdruck erheblich gewachsen.

NÖTIGE LOCKERUNGSÜBUNG ERZEUGEN BINDUNG

Der vielleicht wichtigste Grund sind die atmosphärischen Lockerungsübungen, nicht nur am Mittwoch, sondern auch in den Tagen zuvor. Im Bundestag wird zwar schon immer hinter den Kulissen auch über Parteigrenzen hinweg gesprochen. Aber die Intensität, mit der man sich bilateral zwischen CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen um Kontakte bemüht, hat erheblich zugenommen. Bisheriger Höhepunkt war der Besuch von Seehofer in der Grünen-Parteizentrale am Dienstag - ein fast schon historischer Moment angesichts der jahrelangen gegenseitigen Animositäten. Der CSU-Chef wiederholte diese Geste als atmosphärischer “Eisbrecher” dann noch mit einem Besuch bei der FDP.

Und am Mittwoch wurden gezielt Bilder lächelnder Politiker auf dem Balkon der Parlamentarischen Gesellschaft für die wartenden Fotografen und Kameraleute produziert. Mal winkte CDU-Chefin und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel im Kreis von Grünen-Politikern vom Balkon, mal FDP-Chef Christian Lindner zusammen mit CSU-Vertretern und der Kanzlerin. “Je harmonischer man sich aber nach außen zeigt, desto schwerer ist später zu vermitteln, warum keine Einigung möglich war”, heißt es in Jamaika-Kreisen. Ohnehin passt das Lächeln der Akteure genau zur Erwartung der Wähler. Laut ZDF-Politbarometer erwarten 80 Prozent der Grünen-, 75 Prozent der FDP- und 68 Prozent der Unions-Anhänger die Bildung einer Jamaika-Koalition. Denen müsste man das Scheitern der Gespräche erklären.

Ein wenig ähnelte die Stimmung dem ersten Besuch des französischen Präsident Emmanuel Macron in Berlin Mitte Mai, als Merkel ein Hermann-Hesse-Zitat nutzte, um das zukünftige Verhältnis zu beschreiben: “Allem Anfang wohnt ein Zauber inne.”

DER WUNSCH ZU REGIEREN

In den vergangenen Tagen wurde zudem deutlich, wie sehr alle vier Parteien bereits in Kategorien des Regierens denken. Zwar betonte FDP-Chef Lindner am Donnerstag erneut, die Chancen auf eine Jamaika-Koalition stünden “Fifty-Fifty”. Aber gleichzeitig lässt sich Lindner in Interviews ständig über Ministeriumszuschnitte oder die Besetzung des Finanzministeriums aus. In der Union wird dazu vermerkt, dass so nur jemand argumentiere, der bereits an eine eigene Regierungsbeteiligung denke. FDP-Vize Wolfgang Kubicki betont jedenfalls, dass er sich für ministrabel hält und durchaus fähig, das Bundesfinanzministerium zu übernehmen.

Den Grünen-Realos wird ohnehin unterstellt, unbedingt regieren zu wollen - dementsprechend optimistisch äußerte sich etwa Geschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Mittwoch, der nach dem Treffen mit der Union ein “gutes Gespräch” erlebt haben wollte. Und Partei-Chef Cem Özdemir wird nachgesagt, er sei am Amt des Außenministers interessiert, was dieser bislang nicht dementiert hat.

CSU-Chef Seehofer lässt sich - trotz aller noch bestehenden inhaltlichen Differenzen - die Bereitschaft der CSU zu Regierungsbildung ablesen. “Es gab keine Verspannungen”, sagte er. Und Kanzleramtschef Peter Altmaier (CDU) folgerte nach den ersten Sondierungsrunden, er sehe bei allen Beteiligten den Willen, dass “dieses Experiment” ein Erfolg werde.

GEMEINSAME ANGST VOR DER AFD

Dazu kommt eine gemeinsame Angst, die allen vier Parteien letztlich den Ausstieg aus den Jamaika-Gesprächen versperrt. Denn auch wenn die FDP anfangs alles andere als glücklich wirkte, dass der sofortige Rückzug der SPD in die Opposition nur eine Jamaika-Lösung möglich macht: Die Hoffnung, dass die Sozialdemokraten bei einem Scheitern der Gespräche als zweite Option zur Verfügung stünden, sind auch in der CSU gen Null gesunken. Scheitern die Sondierungen, dann wären wohl nur noch Neuwahlen möglich.

Aber die wollten eigentlich alle vier Parteien verhindern, heißt es in Unionskreisen. Denn wie ein Elefant stand am Mittwoch die AfD im Raum in der Parlamentarischen Gesellschaft. Über die Rechtspopulisten wurde zwar kaum geredet. Aber Seehofer betonte am Abend, dass man umso mehr über den gemeinsamen Wunsch aller Anwesenden gesprochen habe, einen Beitrag gegen Polarisierung, Radikalisierung und Spaltung zu leisten. Und bei einer Neuwahl, so die gemeinsame Überzeugung, würde wohl nur eine Partei sicher profitieren - die AfD, meint auch Forsa-Chef Manfred Güllner.

India woke up to roads littered with layers of firecracker waste on Friday (October 20), a day after celebration of Diwali- Hindu festival of lights. Diwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India's majority Hindu community. The scene in New Delhi looked no different from the previous years despite the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers early this month to prevent a repeat of severe pollution levels that left the capital choking. However, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers. A local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions. Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years. Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Friday he believed Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) CSeries planes would capture half the market for smaller single-aisle aircraft with the sale of “thousands” of the 110-to-130 seat jets.
A Bombardier CSeries aircraft is pictured during a news conference to announce a partnership between Airbus and Bombardier on the C Series aircraft programme, in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, October 17, 2017.
On Thursday, the head of a major U.S. airplane leasing company said the deal boosts confidence in the CSeries programme, but is unlikely to drive a flurry of immediate sales.
Customers will likely remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.
Commercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.

“I see no reason why we should not be able to capture 50 percent of that market,” Enders said in Montreal at a breakfast organised by the city’s chamber of commerce. “I think we will sell thousands.”

Europe’s largest aerospace group on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries programme for $1 (75p), a move expected to reduce costs while bolstering the plane’s sales and giving Canada’s Bombardier a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing Co (BA.N) and U.S. regulators.

The lightweight, carbon-composite jet, which costs $6 billion to develop, has won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months.

On Thursday, the head of a major U.S. airplane leasing company said the deal boosts confidence in the CSeries programme, but is unlikely to drive a flurry of immediate sales.

Customers will likely remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.

Some analysts have suggested that Airbus’s 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries could reverberate throughout the aerospace industry, triggering a riposte from other planemakers, including Boeing itself.

Commercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.

Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Canada’s Bombardier compete in the market between 100 and 150 seats as well as in the market for smaller regional jets.

Enders, who addressed Montreal’s business leaders with Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare, said the industry-changing venture would have a ripple effect, but didn’t specify what he meant further. “New alliances will be formed,” he said.

NAIROBI/MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The size and methods of the latest truck bombing in Mogadishu show how international and Somali government efforts to stop the killings are failing, partly because intelligence gathering to counter such attacks is so disjointed, security sources say.

More than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on Saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. The Islamist insurgency al Shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely.

Somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said Hussein Moalim Mohamud Sheikh Ali, a former national security adviser to the president.

“The national security architecture is in tatters,” he told Reuters. “The Shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state.”

The increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in Somalia ahead of the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers at the end of the year. They also are a concern for other countries in the region where al Shabaab is active, such as Kenya and Uganda.

In 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in Somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by Nairobi-based thinktank Sahan Research.

Initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al Shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say.

Competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), four Western and one Somali security source told Reuters.

A letter from Somalia’s minister of internal security addressed to the United States, Britain and the United Nations in May complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence.

“Multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counter-terrorism efforts,” said the letter, seen by Reuters.

The pressure is building on President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who must ensure Somalia’s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000-strong AU force leaves.

His government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint U.S.-Somali raid on Bariire in August that residents say killed 10 civilians. Political disagreements threaten co-operation between Somalia’s federal and regional forces.

Last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. The interior ministry spokesman resigned this week.

Somali police did not respond to requests for comment.

HIGH-GRADE EXPLOSIVES

Obtaining high-grade military explosives - the material that makes a bomb explode - involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else.

Making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the Sahan report and an upcoming report from a U.N. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on Somalia.

According to the U.N. report which is due to be published next month, the U.S. Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, which is funded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicle-borne bomb incidents since 2016.

“The potential use of HME (home-made explosive) by al Shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious … allow(ing) the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its IEDs,” said the report.

Al Shabaab, which wants to overthrow Somalia’s U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed.

Mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said.

A former top al Shabaab commander, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. Robow defected to the government in August after the U.S. government removed a $5 million bounty for his capture.

Two Mogadishu-based security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to Reuters.

They said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit Mogadishu International Airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a European Union military training mission.

“One bomb would have breached a checkpoint, opening the way for a larger bomb,” one of the Western security contractors told Reuters. “They also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base.”

The driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack, paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence, he said.

A larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint, but was stopped at one known as Kilometer Five. Panicking, he tried to force his way through, but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck.

“I could see the truck speeding. I also heard few gunshots behind it. Police must have been chasing it,” said Mohamed Ali, 21, who was injured in the blast.

“As it advanced it came to many cars in the street, then the truck driver swerved abruptly to the left lane, but its tyres got stuck in the highway divider. What followed was the blast and smoke.”

The fireball tore through the intersection, incinerating hundreds of civilians. Many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves.

The driver of the car bomb was detained at another checkpoint by soldiers who had taken him out for questioning before its bomb also detonated.

Three security sources told Reuters he identified himself as al Shabaab.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

BMW raided in cartel investigation as Daimler claims immunity

MUNICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - BMW’s (BMWG.DE) headquarters were raided by European Union officials investigating an alleged cartel among German carmakers, it said on Friday, as rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE) claimed whistleblower status in an effort to avoid fines.

EU staff had “conducted an inspection” at BMW’s Munich offices this week, the premium carmaker said in a statement, adding that it is “assisting the European Commission in its work”.

The EU’s Brussels executive said its antitrust officials had swooped unannounced on “a carmaker in Germany” on Monday Oct. 16 in the first confirmed raid related to allegations that several German automakers had engaged in an illegal cartel.

The competition watchdog said in July that it was investigating collusion among German carmakers in response to a tip-off after Der Spiegel magazine reported that Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its Audi and Porsche arms conspired to fix prices in diesel and other technologies over decades.

“The BMW Group wishes to make clear the distinction between potential violations of antitrust law on the one hand and illegal manipulation of exhaust gas treatment on the other,” the company said. “The BMW Group has not been accused of the latter.”

Brussels has yet to initiate formal antitrust proceedings against any of the carmakers.

However, the allegations have begun to spawn U.S. lawsuits, adding to strains on an industry already struggling with the reputational fallout from widespread diesel emissions-test manipulation exposed in the wake of VW’s dieselgate scandal.

Daimler said on Friday that it had “filed an application for immunity from fines with the European Commission some time ago”, effectively claiming to have blown the whistle on what Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber described as “possible antitrust agreements” with rival manufacturers.

Daimler sees no need to set aside any funds for possible antitrust fines, Uebber added.

To gain immunity, the EU’s antitrust website says, a company that participated in a cartel must be the first to inform the Commission of an undetected cartel by providing sufficient information to justify inspections.

The Commission has declined to identify the original source of the tip-off, saying this is to avoid compromising its investigation.

“Daimler is cooperating with the Commission under its leniency programme,” an EU representative said on Friday.

Volkswagen could also benefit from leniency after sharing information, according to earlier reports. Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.

VW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.

Washington (Reuters) - Im Rennen um den künftigen Chefposten bei der US-Notenbank Fed kristallisieren sich mit Jerome Powell und Kevin Warsh zwei heiße Kandidaten heraus: Fed-Direktor Powell hat der Zeitung “Politico” zufolge dabei die Nase vorn.

Doch auch das ehemalige Notenbank-Führungsmitglied Warsh gilt weiter als aussichtsreicher Bewerber. US-Präsident Donald Trump will bald entscheiden, auf wen seine Wahl für das wichtige Amt an den geldpolitischen Schalthebeln gefallen ist. Doch hat er sich offenbar noch nicht festgelegt, wie Reuters von einer mit dem Vorgang vertrauten Person erfuhr: “Ich denke, er neigt noch keinem Kandidaten zu.”

Mit dem 64-jährigen Powell würde ein Währungshüter an die Spitze der mächtigsten Notenbank der Welt rücken, der bereits seit Jahren in deren Führungsetage sitzt. “Als Chef dürfte er wohl die Politik der schrittweisen Normalisierung der Geldpolitik fortsetzen, die Amtsinhaberin Janet Yellen eingeleitet hat”, prognostizieren die Volkswirte der Großbank UniCredit. Yellen hat die Zügel nach einer jahrelange Nullzins-Phase angesichts des anhaltenden Aufschwungs in den USA stufenweise gestrafft - auf das aktuelle Leitzins-Niveau von 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent. Sie will es bis zum Jahresende weiter erhöhen, falls die Konjunkturlage es zulässt.

Der frühere Fed-Direktor Warsh gilt als Anhänger eines strafferen geldpolitischen Kurses. Der heute 47-Jährige hatte sich wegen Differenzen über die von der Notenbank im Kampf gegen die Folgen der globalen Finanzkrise eingeführten Geldschwemme 2011 aus dem Führungsgremium zurückgezogen. Warshs Vorliebe für eine eher straffe Geldpolitik dürfte bei Trump jedoch nicht gut ankommen, da er ein erklärter Anhänger niedriger Zinsen ist.

Der Präsident hatte sich zuletzt nicht in die Karten blicken lassen und gesagt, er möge alle fünf Kandidaten für den Chefposten. Darunter ist auch sein Wirtschaftsberater Gary Cohn sowie der Ökonomie-Professor John Taylor. Alle habe bereits im Weißen Haus vorgesprochen. Als letzte Kandidatin hatte er am Donnerstag Yellen empfangen, deren Amtszeit Anfang Februar 2018 abläuft. Das Treffen sei “gut gelaufen”, sagte ein Insider. Dennoch gilt eine zweite vierjährige Amtszeit für Yellen als eher unwahrscheinlich. Trump hatte sie im Wahlkampf hart attackiert, bevor er ihre Leistung später in milderem Licht darstellte.

WÜRFEL SOLLEN BIS ANFANG NOVEMBER FALLEN

Trump neige zur Ernennung Powells, berichtete die Zeitung “Politico” am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf drei Regierungsinsider, die namentlich nicht genannt wurden. Trump hatte am Dienstag erklärt, er werde seine Entscheidung bald bekanntgeben. Es gilt als wahrscheinlich, dass er sich äußert, bevor er am 3. November zu einer Asien-Reise aufbricht.

Als Reaktion auf den “Politico”-Bericht bauten die US-Staatsanleihen ihre Gewinne aus, in den letzten Handelsminuten der Wall Street drehte der S&P-500-Index noch ins Plus. Experten hatten bereits in den vergangenen Tagen Powell als wahrscheinlichsten Kandidaten bezeichnet.[nL8N1MU0B7] Der Jurist und frühere Investmentbanker hat in dem Führungsgremium der Fed als einziger Vertreter ein republikanisches Parteibuch - ebenso wie Trump.[nL8N1MU1R2] Da der Präsdient seinen Kandidaten auch vom Senat absegnen lassen muss. Da Powell wohl eher eine Linie wie Yellen fahren würde - die von den Demokraten mitgetragen wurde - gilt er als idealer Kompromisskandidat, der bei in beiden politischen Lagern Anklang finden könnte.

President Donald Trump backed away from a bipartisan deal reached by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray. That deal aims to stabilize Obamacare by restoring subsidies to health insurers. Trump wrote in a tweet: "I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care." His decision comes one day after he had signaled his support for the plan. That boosted insurers' stocks, with United Health, Anthem, and Aetna taking the lead. They didn't come down after Trump changed his mind. But hospital stocks, such as Tenet and Select Medical Holding, traded lower. Also falling: shares of drugmakers Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Eli Lilly.

Bank of America (ABC.N) jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s (AAPL.O) 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks.

Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.

The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

“It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

“Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.”

Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

The S&P and the Dow were on track to post gains for the sixth straight week and the Nasdaq for the fourth straight week.

At 11:14 a.m. ET (1514 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 77.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 23,240.82, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 7.26 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,569.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 22.59 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,627.66.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.89 percent gain in the financial index .SPSY.

PayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.

General Electric (GE.N) shares slipped 3.18 percent after the industrial conglomerate reported a profit miss and slashed its earnings forecast.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) dipped 3.19 percent after the company’s sales narrowly missed estimates.

Celgene (CELG.O) slumped more than 10 percent after the company decided to abandon testing a drug to treat Crohn’s disease.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,672 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,745 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

(SOUNDBITE) (Korean) KOREA ECONOMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE, NA JEONG-WON, SAYING: "The purpose of these projects is to earn foreign currency and draw capital from the wealthy locals for the state's economy, rather than to prop up the people's well-being."

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad’s wishes.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties.

The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.

The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.

Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

Iraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.

Sistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.

ACCUSATIONS

Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Iraq’s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war.

Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.

Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.

“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.

An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.

Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

A UNHCR spokesperson said the number of people who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean so far this year now totalled over 1,150. Medea Savary also said an increased number of Syrian families are using the route across the sea to Italy, possibly as a result of the ongoing fighting in Syria and a deterioration in conditions in Libyan refugee camps.

At 10:38 a.m. ET (1438 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 58.21 points, or 0.37 percent, to 15,876.21. It reached as high as 15,879.34, the highest level since Feb. 23.

Consumer staples, home to grocers and other food producers, was the only declining group among the index’s 10 key sectors, slipping 0.2 percent.

The retreat in consumer staples stocks come as retail sales data for August showed an unexpected fall, led by a 2.5 percent drop at food and beverage stores.

Financial stocks, which make up about a third of the index’s weight and can drive direction even when individual stock moves are modest, gained 0.5 percent. Canada’s four largest banks were among the top 10 most influential advancing stocks, with most making gains under 0.6 percent.

Canadian Pacific Railway extended its gains this week after reporting better than expected third-quarter profit late on Tuesday, and was up another 2.0 percent to C$225.35. Canadian National Railway advanced 0.7 percent to C$103.38. The overall industrials sector rose 0.8 percent.

The materials group, which includes mining and other resource firms, added 0.8 percent as nickel prices hit a six-week high and copper prices remained above $7,000 a tonne.

Teck Resources Ltd rallied 3.5 percent to C$28.76.

New Gold Inc jumped 5 percent to C$4.685 after Canaccord Genuity raised its rating and target price.

On the down side, Klondex Mines Ltd fell 8.9 percent to C$4.01 after the company reported third quarter production results.

DHX Media Ltd plunged 11.3 percent to C$4.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 159 to 83, for a 1.92-to-1 ratio on the upside.

The index was posting 15 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - Former President George W. Bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on Thursday in a New York speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of President Donald Trump.

Bush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow Republican’s nine-month White House tenure. He did not mention Trump by name.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” Bush said at the Bush Institute’s National Forum on Freedom, Free Markets and Security.

Trump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “Crooked Hillary” for Democrat Hillary Clinton and, more recently, “Liddle” Bob Corker for a Republican senator who dared to challenge him.

Bush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that Trump has cracked down on while in office.

“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said.

“We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.”

Asked whether the speech was aimed at Trump, a spokesman for Bush said the long-planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years.

“The themes President Bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said Bush spokesman Freddy Ford.

Bush touted U.S. alliances abroad, something Trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused Trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year.

CRITICIZES RUSSIA

In the speech, Bush described a decline in public confidence in U.S. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs.

“Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said. “We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”

Trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that Democratic former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Obama, Trump’s predecessor, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Bush said Americans were the heirs of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

“This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American,” he said. “It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”

Trump has had a rocky relationship with the Bush family. He belittled former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was an early opponent of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, and has criticized George W. Bush for the war in Iraq and for presiding over the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Bush said globalisation could not be wished away “any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

He also had harsh words for Russia and seemed to take aim at Trump for playing down Moscow’s intervention in the U.S. election.

“According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy,” he said.

“Foreign aggressions, including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence, should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home.”

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing “politics of division” that he said was corroding American democracy.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama told campaign rallies in New Jersey and Virginia that voters could send a powerful message about the type of politics they want by backing Democrats in Nov. 7 elections in the two states.

“What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before, that dates back centuries,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark, New Jersey, that chanted: “Four more years.”

“Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That’s folks looking 50 years back,” Obama said. “It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century.”

At a later stop in Richmond, Virginia, Obama said modern politics increasingly did not reflect basic American values of inclusiveness and were driving people away from the process.

“We’ve got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry, to demonize people who have different ideas, to get the base all riled up because it provides a short-term tactical advantage. Sometimes that feels frustrating,” Obama said.

Many of Obama’s comments appeared to be thinly veiled swipes at Trump, whose combative style and inflammatory rhetoric have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Obama made the remarks just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took an indirect swing at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade. [L2N1MU1XD]

Obama’s appearances were aimed at driving up Democratic turnout in New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states holding elections for governor this year. Democrats hope Obama can bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

CLOSELY WATCHED

The two contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can convert the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could offer clues to the national political mood ahead of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

While he has rarely spoken out about politics in the past nine months, Obama said it was critical that supporters get their friends and families to vote.

In Newark, he said no one should assume victory just because opinion polls show Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor.

“I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said in a reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

In the political battleground of Virginia, polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

(The Sports Xchange) - Derek Carr threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree with no time remaining on Thursday, lifting the Raiders to a stunning 31-30 victory against the Kansas City Chiefs that just may have saved Oakland’s season.

The Raiders marched 85 yards in 11 plays for Carr’s touchdown pass, tying the game 30-30. Giorgio Tavecchio kicked the extra point.

Instead of falling four games behind the first-place Chiefs (5-2) in the AFC West, the Raiders (3-4) closed to within two games and snapped a four-game losing streak.

“Obviously, tonight was huge,” Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said. “The key for us is that we really have continued to believe.”

Carr threw what was initially ruled to be a 29-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jared Cook with 16 seconds left. However, after a review, Cook was ruled down by contact inside the 1.

Crabtree then caught a 1-yard touchdown pass with three seconds left, but was flagged for offensive pass interference.

Carr threw incomplete in the end zone on the next play, but Chiefs safety Ron Parker was penalized for holding with the clock at 0:00.

This time Carr hit Crabtree in the left corner of the end zone, and there were no flags.

“D.C. said, ‘Catch the ball,'” Crabtree said. “I went out there and made a play. We didn’t give up. We’ve got a team full of fighters.”

Carr completed 29 of 52 passes for 417 yards and three touchdowns as the Raiders snapped a five-game skid against the Chiefs, who lost their second straight.

Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper caught 11 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns. Cook added six catches for 107 yards.

“It’s great,” Cooper said of the victory. “A big part of football is momentum. Hopefully this game can create a rhythm for our team and we can start to get that momentum.”

Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith was 25 of 36 for 342 yards and three touchdowns. Kansas City wide receiver Tyreek Hill caught six passes for 125 yards and a 64-yard touchdown. Running back Kareem Hunt rushed for 87 yards on 18 carries and caught four passes for 30 yards. He registered his seventh straight game with at least 100 total yards from scrimmage.

Smith believed the Chiefs had won the game in the closing seconds.

“How could you not?” Smith said. “Multiple times I‘m thinking, ‘We lost it. We won it. We lost it. We won it.’ Certainly I think that second-to-last play, the ball got thrown out of the back of the end zone and they called defensive holding on (someone) who’s not even close to the play. That’s the one that sticks out for me.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the U.S. director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.

La Coalición por el Sueño Americano planea pedirle al Congreso que apruebe una legislación bipartidista este año que permita a estos inmigrantes, llamados “Dreamers”, continuar trabajando en Estados Unidos, dijeron los documentos.

Alphabet Inc -una unidad de Google-, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc, IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc y otras compañías importantes de Estados Unidos figuran como miembros del grupo, muestra uno de los documentos.

Intel, Uber y Univision Communications Inc confirmaron su membresía, pero las otras compañías no hicieron comentarios al respecto. Es posible que los planes para lanzar el grupo puedan cambiar.

“Nos complace unirnos con otras organizaciones para instar al Congreso a aprobar una legislación para proteger a los Dreamers”, dijo el portavoz de Intel, Will Moss, en un comunicado.

Matthew Wing, un portavoz de Uber, declaró: “Uber se unió a la Coalición por el Sueño Americano porque estamos junto a los Dreamers”.

La iniciativa a favor de esta legislación viene después de que el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, puso fin el mes pasado al programa conocido como Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA, por su sigla en inglés) y dio al Congreso seis meses para hallar una solución.

DACA, que comenzó en 2012 con el presidente Barack Obama, ofreció a casi 800.000 jóvenes -que llegaron ilegalmente al país siendo niños- protección ante la posibilidad de ser deportados y el derecho a trabajar.

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Famous artist Jan Fabre brings his fresh show "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" to Moscow - his Antwerp theater's first gig in Russia since 2009. "I'm making a kind of a critical love declaration to my country. Belgium is like Russia," Fabre said. "We are world powers. We are bigger than China, bigger than Russia, bigger than America. No, it's not true. We are so small. So 'Belgium Rules' is quite ironical, because we never historically had any militaristic power, any economical power." A four-hour performance balances between acute satire and tender sentiment and takes the audience on an ironic tour through the author's motherland. Sparkles and glitter hail on pompous plumes of carnival dresses as dancers in wooden clogs tap the rhythm of a Belgian fiesta. "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" includes Belgian specialties like its beer, chocolate, bicycles and smoking pipes to grotesque masquerade, exposing all the vices of Belgian society and questioning its rules. "My aim as an artist is to evoke the minds of spectators, to make spectators feel and think in a different way," Fabre said. "But this is never in the working process - oh, we're gonna shock or provoke people. Never." The performance is interlaced with elegant living pictures reminiscent of the works of the country's famous painters. "Don't forget - we are a country that created oil painting," Fabre said proudly ahead of his show that pays homage to Hieronymus Bosch's "Ship of Fools" painting, Pieter Bruegel's snowy fields and the misty lands of Rene Magritte. "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" was brought to Russia by the Territory festival - a platform which has promoted modern theater in Russia since 2005.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North American department of North Korea’s foreign ministry, told a non-proliferation conference in Moscow Washington would “have to put up” with North Korea’s nuclear status, RIA reported.

“This is a matter of life and death for us. The current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack.”

“We will respond to fire with fire.”

Pyongyang would regard any attempts to strangle the country via U.N. Security Council sanctions as an attempt “to declare war”.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing the same conference earlier on Friday, urged world powers to get behind a joint Russian-Chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over North Korea’s weapons program.

“We are convinced that its implementation will promote the lessening of military activity and tension on the Korean peninsula and the forming in Northeastern Asia of a system of equal and indivisible security,” he said.

The plan proposes a moratorium on North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons tests, while South Korea and the United States suspend holding military exercises.

“The main task at the current stage is to prevent a military conflict which will inevitably lead to a large-scale humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,” Lavrov said. “All the sides involved should exercise restraint.”

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga, who says he will boycott a presidential election re-run due next week, said on Friday he would announce a “way forward” the day before the scheduled poll, raising the possibility he might participate after all.

At a memorial in western Kenya for opposition supporters killed in protests against the vote set for Oct. 26, Odinga told his supporters not to attack “innocent people” including people who support his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta.

He did not comment on an announcement by the electoral board chief executive Ezra Chiloba earlier on Friday that he would take three weeks’ leave.

Kenya is holding the re-run after the Supreme Court threw out the result of an Aug. 8 election won by the incumbent Kenyatta but disputed by the challenger Odinga. The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud.

The opposition has demanded Chiloba resign, and the announcement that he will not participate in running the vote suggests progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations involving Western diplomats and religious and civil society leaders.

Uncertainty over whether Odinga will participate in the election and concerns that it may not proceed peacefully have left Kenya, a traditionally stable Western ally in an often chaotic region, mired in political crisis.

The volatile build-up to the Oct. 26 vote has revived memories for Kenyans of ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a disputed election in 2007, when Odinga also lost and disputed the result.

Chiloba told Reuters that, in light of the opposition’s demands, he was going on leave, and that all arrangements for next week’s vote were in place.

At least 45 people died nationwide in a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the August vote, including a six-month old baby struck on the head by a police baton.

With Odinga yet to respond to Chiloba’s decision to go on leave, diplomats said they were unsure what would happen next.

“The crystal ball is very cloudy at the moment,” a senior western diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters. “The situation is changing by the hour.”

REVIEW OF BOYCOTT?

Slideshow (7 Images)

The electoral board has said next week’s election will go ahead. Odinga met its chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday and later told reporters that if there were serious consultations and serious reforms, the opposition could review its boycott.

Chebukati had said a day earlier that he could not guarantee the election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against colleagues. A fellow board member resigned this week after fleeing to the United States, saying she feared for her life.

The opposition has held near-daily protests demanding electoral reforms and the sacking of board officials. Police said on Friday four people were killed as a result of their interventions to stop demonstrations.

Kenyatta has meanwhile urged Kenyans to come out in large numbers to vote, insisting the ballot be held. On Thursday, he snubbed an invitation to meet Chebukati, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning.

In a speech in Nairobi on Friday, Kenyatta said the election must not divide the nation or push it to the brink.

Disruptions of the vote by “those who thrive in chaos and relish anarchy” would not be tolerated, and security forces “have been enhanced and appropriately deployed to maintain law and order”, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - For the Bank of England, the hard bit about finally raising interest rates will be getting borrowers to heed the message it is likely to send: that they should not fear many more hikes any time soon.

Britons have not seen their debt costs rise since July 2007, shortly before the financial crisis which pushed the world’s fifth-biggest economy into its deepest recession in decades.

Now, eight years into the recovery, the BoE is saying it is likely to raise rates “in the coming months”. Investors mostly say that means as soon as Nov. 2, after its next policy meeting.

At one level, increasing Bank Rate to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent would represent only a reversal of last year’s emergency rate cut after the shock Brexit vote.

But many British businesses are worried it might have an outsized impact on the mindset of consumers.

“When I have been around the country, businesses have been asking a lot about the Bank of England,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

“There is nervousness about the psychological impact of the first increase.”

The messaging challenge could be all the harder after several failed attempts in recent years by Governor Mark Carney and the BoE to signal when rates were likely to rise.

The guidance was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call Carney an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014, an epithet that has stuck.

In June, sterling fell and then rose as Carney made two speeches in eight days in which he seemed to change the emphasis of his message away from being in no hurry to consider a rate hike to saying one might become necessary.

It remains unclear if the BoE will pull the trigger in November. Most economists polled by Reuters last month said the time was not right for a hike, yet they still expected the BoE to press on.

British inflation is at a five-year high of 3 percent, above the BoE’s 2 percent target. But the economy is facing deep uncertainty about Britain’s departure from the European Union and is growing at half the pace of the euro zone.

NOT THAT BIG A DEAL?

Paul Fisher, a BoE rate-setter until 2014, said raising rates once by 25 basis points was “not that big a deal”.

“The key thing is what they say alongside it,” he said. “The Bank has been out of the game ... in terms of affecting ordinary people’s lives. It might suddenly become part of their consciousness again, especially the people who pay a mortgage.”

The BoE has said repeatedly that it expects to raise rates in a “limited and gradual” way, echoing the caution among many other central banks about the fragility of their economies.

Economists say it will probably continue to send that cautious message after its first move.

Financial markets expect the BoE to make only one 25-basis point rate hike in 2018 after a first increase next month.

It remains to be seen whether British consumers, the main drivers of the economy, see it that way too.

“On the occasions when the Bank has tried to signal quite clearly that they’re making just a one-off hike, households haven’t listened to the nuanced guidance,” Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.

“They see their mortgage rates going up and they prepare for more increases in that direction.”

When the BoE last raised rates in 2007, it said it had made no judgment on its next move. But the balance of households expecting a hike over the next 12 months stood at double the historical average a month later and consumer confidence fell, Tombs said.

BoE officials, like their peers around the world, have tried increasingly to find the best way to speak to borrowers.

In contrast to the days when central banks operated in near-secrecy and did not even publicly announce rate changes, Carney gives regular media interviews to speak directly to consumers and companies whose spending drives the economy.

But things do not always go to plan.

Carney has often had to challenge the idea that the BoE’s guidance on rates represents a rock-solid promise. That nuance is often lost in media reporting, BoE officials complain.

“It’s not always fully understood,” the central bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane told reporters after speaking at an event in London earlier this month. “When the data changes and the facts change, our view needs to evolve. That doesn’t mean the view was wrong before. The facts sometimes change.”

This time, however, even economists who think the BoE would be making a mistake by raising rates in November say it looks likely to happen, even if only to avoid another communications misfire that could further complicate its messaging task.

Jean Michel Six, chief economist in Europe for ratings agency Standard & Poor‘s, said the BoE ran the risk of losing credibility if it continued to hold off.

“It’s a bit of a vicious circle. Once you go too far in the direction of saying you may very well increase rates, you have to do it. Otherwise you lose your credibility,” Six said.

“It’s a game you can only play for some time.”

Often compared to services from Yelp Inc (YELP.N) and Groupon Inc (GRPN.O), Meituan-Dianping is an online platform for a range of services including movie ticketing, food delivery, restaurant bookings, beauty services, travel and luxury goods.

Its biggest rivals include e-commerce pair Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and JD.com Inc (JD.O), both of which have championed a shift into offline stores in recent years, spurred by developments in cloud computing and big data technology.

Meituan-Dianping’s plans include opening a chain of offline stores, beginning in Beijing earlier this year, as well as developing technology in logistics and AI.

In July, Meituan-Dianping’s vice-president of strategy told Reuters the firm was not considering an initial public offering until it had established infrastructure for services including offline retail, and had roughly $3 billion in cash reserves remaining from a previous funding round.

Meituan-Dianping said it has 280 million users and serves as a platform for roughly 5 million businesses.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - If Daimler’s cars were as slow as its restructuring, the company would have few customers. The Mercedes-Benz parent has problems aplenty, which bumper third-quarter sales do little to change. A plan to carve out its car and truck units might help lift its valuation if that eventually led to a separate listing. But at the current pace of progress, investors have no reason to give the company much credit.

Friday’s third-quarter results were a reminder of the rocky ride that Daimler faces in the short term. One-off costs such as diesel-emissions fixes meant third-quarter operating profit fell by 14 percent from a year earlier to 3.5 billion euros. That was despite record sales of almost 600,000 Mercedes-Benz and smart automobiles. But the real challenges for auto groups like the Mercedes maker are far bigger and include a margin-sapping shift to electric vehicles and potentially declining car ownership from the growth of ride-hailing apps.

There’s no fighting these trends, but Daimler could do shareholders a favour by spinning off its trucks and buses arms, which merit a higher valuation than the conglomerate’s lowly multiple of 7.7 times forward earnings. First, the division faces less fierce competition than the cars business. Second, online shopping has created a boom in logistics and delivery vehicles. Daimler trucks and buses together brought in more than 37 billion euros of revenue last year, but barely show up in the German group’s share price because of a huge conglomerate discount. Spinning them off could boost the group’s value by more than 30 billion euros, Evercore ISI analysts estimate.

Daimler’s management is alert to the threats facing the industry, and has proposed sensible restructuring ideas to adapt to a changing world. For example, the company on Monday announced its plan to split into three parts – trucks and buses, cars and vans, and financial services. But neither separate listings nor divestments are currently part of management’s public plans. Even the intermediate step of legally separating the three bits will be voted on in 2019 at the earliest. A more meaningful restructuring is too far away to make much difference to Daimler’s valuation right now.

Donald Trump last week signed an executive order and took further administrative action that will weaken the healthcare coverage of millions of Americans. The president is required by Article Two of the Constitution to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So are his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional?

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.

Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.

He was quoted in an interview in Lebanon’s al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in Syria between 1994 and 2004. He did not reveal his present location.

Gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with Israel. His assassination occurred during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.

His death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on Sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many Lebanese and triggered the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut’s Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.

Gemayel was head of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, Muslim and Palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by Israel.

Its invasion was aimed at driving from Lebanon the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as well as the Syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.

After his assassination, Israel entered the capital Beirut and allowed Gemayel’s militia, the Lebanese Forces, to access the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps, where their fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.

Gemayel’s family is still one of the most important in Lebanese politics, heading the Kataeb party that was founded by his father. The Lebanese Forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, Samir Geagea.

September’s deficit stood at 5.902 billion pounds, down almost 11 percent from the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, citing figures that exclude state-controlled banks.

The shortfall was much smaller than the median forecast of 6.5 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.

With the first half of the 2017/18 financial year complete, government borrowing is down 7.2 percent on a the same period a year ago, even though the prospect of Britain’s departure from the European Union has weighed on the overall economy.

But the strong performance of the public finances so far this financial year probably overstates how much official borrowing forecasts are likely to be revised down next month, the body which compiles the forecasts said on Friday.

Still, the figures will likely cheer Hammond, who has been told his job is at risk by supporters of Britain’s departure from the European Union, who think he is too negative and is starving other ministers of funds needed to prepare for Brexit.

Hammond has also come under broader pressure from within the ruling Conservative Party as well as from the opposition Labour Party to loosen his grip on public spending when he presents his annual budget next month.

But his ability to relax his grip on spending looks limited after Britain’s budget forecasters said this month they were likely to cut their productivity growth forecasts, suggesting slower economic growth, and tax revenues, in the future.

“We suspect the Chancellor will find the funds he needs to deal with the most pressing demands, albeit without throwing the task of fiscal consolidation completely out of the window,” Investec economist Victoria Clarke said of the Nov. 22 budget.

For now, tax revenues remain healthy. Receipts from value-added tax on the sale of goods and services, income tax and the stamp duty property tax were higher than a year ago. But corporation tax revenues were down slightly.

Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke warned the second half of the financial year is set to be tougher, given self-assessed income tax receipts around the turn of the year will likely show a deterioration compared with 2016/17.

The finance ministry said on Friday it had made great progress in cutting the budget deficit by over two-thirds since 2010, but borrowing was still too high at over 150 million pounds a day.

INTEREST PAYMENTS RISE

Britain paid out 3.7 billion pounds in government debt interest payments, up 11.4 percent compared with a year ago and pushed up by a rise in inflation. Around a third of British government bonds are linked to inflation.

A move by the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the coming months -- something it signalled in September was likely -- could push up debt payments further.

Britain has been struggling to fix its public finances since the budget deficit surged to around 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 after the global financial crisis.

Since then it has been cut steadily to 2.3 percent of GDP in the 2016/17 financial year which ended in March, its smallest since before the global financial crisis.

Swiss flushing away millions in gold and silver every year

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
ZURICH (Reuters) - While London’s sewers can get clogged with fatbergs made up of grease and diapers, it seems Switzerland’s waste system is flecked with silver and gold.
Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).
This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.
The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.
“It wouldn’t make sense for people to boil their tap water to recover gold or silver because it has already been filtered out before it re-enters the drinking water supply,” Vriens said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - While London’s sewers can get clogged with fatbergs made up of grease and diapers, it seems Switzerland’s waste system is flecked with silver and gold.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).

But before people start hunting in their drains for jewelry, the government study said the tiny particles were likely to be mostly from the watchmaking, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, which use the metals in their products and processes.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.

“It wouldn’t make sense for people to boil their tap water to recover gold or silver because it has already been filtered out before it re-enters the drinking water supply,” Vriens said.

The move came after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell this week rejected Trump’s calls to punish players who kneel for the anthem to protest racism. Trump has said the protests are unpatriotic and disrespectful of military veterans.

“The President has asked for a list of supporters who stand for the National Anthem. Add your name below to show your patriotism and support,” said the petition issued on Thursday by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a fundraising organization for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

The petition was published on the Republican National Committee website. It did not indicate how many signatures had been received.

Players kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” are protesting the killing of unarmed black men and boys by police across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the country’s criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.

Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first popularized the gesture last year, said he settled on kneeling as a form of protest because it is widely seen as a gesture of respect.

Goodell said on Wednesday after a meeting of league owners that the NFL would continue to nurture players’ efforts to fight racial disparities in the criminal justice system, believing this would make the urge to protest fade.

Trump has repeatedly expressed disdain for the protests since a rally in September. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, he called the NFL’s decision, “Too much talk, not enough action.”

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Unilever’s struggle gives hope to predators. The consumer giant that fended off a bid from Kraft Heinz earlier this year reported weak third-quarter sales on Thursday. Chief Executive Paul Polman is sprucing up brands, but the more pedestrian Unilever’s performance, the more vulnerable it becomes.

The maker of pot-noodles blamed factors beyond its control for a weak third quarter, which saw sales excluding disposals and acquisitions rise by 2.6 percent, well short of analysts’ expectations of 3.9 percent. The hot summer meant people ate less ice cream, while hurricanes disrupted spending and shipping.

Yet the figures also reflect longer-term challenges. Growth in developed economies is slow, and health-conscious customers are changing their habits, meaning consumer goods companies cannot rely on old brands. One example: Halo Top, a family-owned healthy ice cream brand, grabbed share in North America. Unilever reckons just half its products took a bigger slice of their respective markets, down from around 60 percent in previous years.

Polman is making the right calls. He is selling dying brands, like margarine, buying new ones, and finding fresh ways of distributing products, like direct-to-consumer subscription services. And while the outlook in Europe and North America is dull, emerging economies are growing quickly. Unilever is also pushing up margins: analysts expect the company to convert 20 percent of sales into operating profit by 2020.

Still, Polman can’t rest easy. Unilever will need a strong fourth quarter if it is to meet its target for sales growth of 3 to 5 percent this year. More disappointments could revive takeover interest. Investors might look more favourably on Kraft Heinz’s near-30 percent operating margin if Unilever’s growth remains little better than average. Activist investors who are taking on ever-bigger targets such as Procter & Gamble, might also see the company as a candidate for deeper cost cutting and more radical surgery. Unilever’s battles are far from over.

Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.

He was quoted in an interview in Lebanon’s al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in Syria between 1994 and 2004. He did not reveal his present location.

Gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with Israel. His assassination occurred during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.

His death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on Sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many Lebanese and triggered the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut’s Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.

Supporters of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) carry a banner with pictures of Nabil al Alam (L) and Habib Shartouni (R) during a protest outside a court building in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.

Supporters of both Shartouni and Gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.

Gemayel was head of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, Muslim and Palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by Israel.

Its invasion was aimed at driving from Lebanon the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as well as the Syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.

After his assassination, Israel entered the capital Beirut and allowed Gemayel’s militia, the Lebanese Forces, to access the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps, where their fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.

Gemayel’s family is still one of the most important in Lebanese politics, heading the Kataeb party that was founded by his father. The Lebanese Forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, Samir Geagea.

While the law, which takes effect by July 1, 2018, does not specify which face coverings are prohibited, the debate has largely focused on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers.

Like France, which passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004, Quebec has struggled to reconcile its secular identity with a growing Muslim population, many of them North African emigrants.

“We are just saying that for reasons linked to communication, identification and safety, public services should be given and received with an open face,” Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard told reporters in the province’s National Assembly.

“We are in a free and democratic society. You speak to me, I should see your face, and you should see mine. It’s as simple as that,” he said.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims said it was deeply concerned by the law’s passage and was looking at its legal options.

“This legislation is an unjustified infringement of religious freedoms,” said executive director Ihsaan Gardee.

The law allows for exemptions under certain circumstances, although it did not provide details. Regulations setting out how the new law will be enforced are yet to come.

Asked in the federal parliament whether he would challenge the law, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a Montreal district, said he would continue to ensure all Canadians are protected by the country’s charter of rights and freedoms, “while respecting the choices that different legislative assemblies can make.”

France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have imposed restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils in public places, with Denmark on track to set its own ban.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. In January, six people were killed in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque. A French-Canadian university student has been charged as the sole suspect.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The works council of Tata Steel Netherlands said on Friday it opposed preliminary plans by Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp to combine their European steelmaking operations into a joint venture (JV) and would fight to block it if necessary.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The works council of Tata Steel Netherlands said on Friday it opposed preliminary plans by Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp to combine their European steelmaking operations into a joint venture (JV) and would fight to block it if necessary.

Works council chairman Frits van Wieringen said that, after viewing the two companies’ memorandum of understanding, he was concerned they intend to dissolve the Dutch subsidiary, which would strip away legal protections, and then lay off workers.

“They are talking about 10 percent of jobs being lost, but we think it will be much more than that,” he told Reuters.

In September the two companies announced plans to merge their European steelmaking operations. The JV would have 42,000 employees, with 10,000 in the Netherlands.

The companies said last month the deal would help address overcapacity in Europe’s steel market, which faces cheap imports, subdued construction demand and inefficient legacy plants. The merger would also result in up to 4,000 job cuts, or about 8 percent of the joint workforce, they said.

Works councils in the Netherlands and Germany have significant powers and their approval is required for a change of corporate structure to be carried out, Van Wieringen said.

“Make no mistake, the Germans are also opposed to this as it stands,” he said.

He said the works council expects to hear more detailed plans from Tata and Thyssenkrupp early next year. For now it has notified the supervisory and management boards of Tata Steel Netherlands that it will oppose the JV.

Bank of America (ABC.N) jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s (AAPL.O) 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks.

Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.

The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

“It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

“Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.”

Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

The S&P and the Dow were on track to post gains for the sixth straight week and the Nasdaq for the fourth straight week.

At 11:14 a.m. ET (1514 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 77.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 23,240.82, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 7.26 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,569.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 22.59 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,627.66.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.89 percent gain in the financial index .SPSY.

PayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.

General Electric (GE.N) shares slipped 3.18 percent after the industrial conglomerate reported a profit miss and slashed its earnings forecast.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) dipped 3.19 percent after the company’s sales narrowly missed estimates.

Celgene (CELG.O) slumped more than 10 percent after the company decided to abandon testing a drug to treat Crohn’s disease.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,672 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,745 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Famous artist Jan Fabre brings his fresh show "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" to Moscow - his Antwerp theater's first gig in Russia since 2009. "I'm making a kind of a critical love declaration to my country. Belgium is like Russia," Fabre said. "We are world powers. We are bigger than China, bigger than Russia, bigger than America. No, it's not true. We are so small. So 'Belgium Rules' is quite ironical, because we never historically had any militaristic power, any economical power." A four-hour performance balances between acute satire and tender sentiment and takes the audience on an ironic tour through the author's motherland. Sparkles and glitter hail on pompous plumes of carnival dresses as dancers in wooden clogs tap the rhythm of a Belgian fiesta. "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" includes Belgian specialties like its beer, chocolate, bicycles and smoking pipes to grotesque masquerade, exposing all the vices of Belgian society and questioning its rules. "My aim as an artist is to evoke the minds of spectators, to make spectators feel and think in a different way," Fabre said. "But this is never in the working process - oh, we're gonna shock or provoke people. Never." The performance is interlaced with elegant living pictures reminiscent of the works of the country's famous painters. "Don't forget - we are a country that created oil painting," Fabre said proudly ahead of his show that pays homage to Hieronymus Bosch's "Ship of Fools" painting, Pieter Bruegel's snowy fields and the misty lands of Rene Magritte. "Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules" was brought to Russia by the Territory festival - a platform which has promoted modern theater in Russia since 2005.

Some middle-class Americans worry Trump health subsidies cut will hurt

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Tom Westerman voted for Donald Trump in last year’s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies.
Westerman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.
Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers.
In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.
Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare.

“It really upset me,” said Westerman, 63, a self-described “middle-class guy” with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.

Westerman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.

Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.

Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama’s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.

“It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,” said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.

Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter’s college tuition. “He says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?”

A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has called subsidy payments a “gift” for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.

Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.

“I support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,” said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.

“Forget the president – it’s the Congress’s responsibility. They’re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,” Heuring said.

In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.

On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.

Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump’s cutoff is settled in court.

The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.

MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE

If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.

Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.

Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America’s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.

Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump’s decision.

“The first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,” said Feit, a Democrat.

Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.

“It is a concern obviously,” Lewis said.

A tentative green light. EU leaders agree to make internal preparations for the second phase of Brexit talks with London. European Council President Donald Tusk confirming the news on the second day of a summit in Brussels But leaders still want a clearer commitment that Britain will settle its financial obligations. And that's where things continue to stall. May failed to break the deadlock during a dinner on Thursday night. Although she remained upbeat as she left the conference. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, THERESA MAY, SAYING: "What I've made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contribution is what I set out in my Florence speech, which is that I have said that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plan, that they would have to either pay in more or receive less as a result of the UK leaving, and that we will honour the commitments that we have made during our membership." Leaders are now expected to target December for London to improve its settlement offer. With many in the UK keen for things to progress. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, CEBR, VICKY PRYCE, SAYING: "Businesses are screaming now. I mean the interesting thing is when you read anything in the newspapers these days whether it's the right wing press or centre right of centre left press, what do you have got nice horror stories of what a no deal might mean and there's a lot of focus on that." May returns home to good news. Britain posted its smallest budget deficit for any September in the past 10 years September's figures marked the third straight month in which the public finances performed better than expected That after a week of disappointing data including a 3 per cent inflation rate And retail sales in September showing their weakest growth in four years.

Most of us take it for granted. Getting your connectivity back in Cameroon was reason to party .... After the government shut the internet down - for three months. (SOUNDBITE) (English) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNET WITHOUT BORDERS, JULIE OWONO, SAYING: "The case of Cameroon is particularly worrying ... We estimated that the country lost five million euros in 94 days of internet shutdown." It forced some developers to move - these relocating from the start-up hub in Buea to New Bonako, to carry on. And basic freedoms appear in danger as much as the bottom line. Since the start of 2016, 13 African governments are thought to have used shutdowns during, mainly, elections or protests - on 21 separate occasions. Triple the number of the previous two years. (SOUNDBITE) (English) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNET WITHOUT BORDERS, JULIE OWONO, SAYING: "We fear that it is likely to continue because up until now the international community, and specifically allies of the state which have used internet shutdowns, have been quite silent." Activists say newer methods are on the rise. 'Throttling' to reduce bandwidth - or 'filtering' to block specific sites like Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp. Or forcing telcos to cut access to mobile customers. Sometimes with help from outside. (SOUNDBITE) (English) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNET WITHOUT BORDERS, JULIE OWONO, SAYING: "It is a testing ground for authoritarian practices especially in the digital space ... and we have seen some of these western companies selling surveillance products to repressive regimes such as Libya, such as Gabon." 2016 was the sixth straight year of decline in internet freedom, according to one report. While the economic bill goes the other way ... Shutdowns in sub-Sahara Africa estimated to have cost over 200 million dollars - just since 2015. Many users thinking twice about how and where they log on - for fear of getting switched off.

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The White House was "stunned" by claims by Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson that President Donald Trump was "insensitive" during a phone call to the widow of a fallen soldier, Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday (October 19).
Kelly, who lost his own son in Afghanistan, criticized the politicization of the call, which he described as being "the most difficult thing you can imagine."
Trump was calling the widow of Sergeant La David T. Johnson, who, along with three other U.S. soldiers, was killed in a firefight in Niger.
The U.S. military is investigating the incident to find out what went wrong and what, if any, changes need to be made.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - XPO Logistics Inc said on Friday it is hiring more than 6,000 seasonal workers for the crucial peak holiday season, roughly 20 percent more than last year, as the third-largest publicly traded U.S. logistics company gears up for a surge in e-commerce deliveries.
“E-commerce is the most exciting dynamic in the logistics industry,” Troy Cooper, XPO’s chief operating officer, told Reuters.
Deloitte Consulting predicts sales of $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, with e-commerce sales jumping 18 percent to 21 percent.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - XPO Logistics Inc said on Friday it is hiring more than 6,000 seasonal workers for the crucial peak holiday season, roughly 20 percent more than last year, as the third-largest publicly traded U.S. logistics company gears up for a surge in e-commerce deliveries.

XPO’s previously undisclosed plans reflect higher expectations for shipping demand for the holiday rush, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January.

The low U.S. jobless rate heading into peak this year poses a challenge for XPO and other major logistics and shipping companies, such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc, which must add thousands of temporary workers to handle as much as twice their normal package volumes.

XPO is a big player in e-commerce deliveries through its contract logistics and “last-mile” services for heavy goods, with a North American supply chain workforce of roughly 26,000 employees across 388 sites.

“E-commerce is the most exciting dynamic in the logistics industry,” Troy Cooper, XPO’s chief operating officer, told Reuters. “We’re constantly in recruiting mode, and we’re ramping that up for the holiday peak.”

Shoppers this year will shell out more on holiday gifting, according to industry surveys, buoyed by a labor market that is churning out more jobs every month, rising home prices and stock markets hovering at record highs.

Deloitte Consulting predicts sales of $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, with e-commerce sales jumping 18 percent to 21 percent.

FedEx expects to add more than 50,000 positions and offer extra hours to some current staff, while UPS said it would add 95,000 seasonal workers.

Seasonal hiring plans also give a glimpse into retailers’ holiday sales expectations as the companies make nearly a third of their annual sales during the period.

Amazon.com Inc said it would hire 120,000 workers in the U.S. this season, same as last year, joining a list of U.S. retailers cautious about their hiring plans amid an improving job market. [L4N1MN4RQ] [L4N1M142T]

PARIS (Reuters) - Abdelkader Merah a admis pour la première fois vendredi que son frère Mohamed, tueur de militaires et d‘enfants juifs, était un “musulman terroriste” mais a joué de toutes les ambiguïtés pour s‘exonérer de toute responsabilité dans cette dérive sanglante.

Mohamed Merah a été abattu le 22 mars 2012 à Toulouse lors d‘un assaut des forces de l‘ordre contre son appartement après avoir tué trois soldats, trois écoliers juifs et le père de deux d‘entre eux à Montauban et Toulouse. Des meurtres revendiqués par un groupe affilié à la nébuleuse islamiste Al Qaïda.

Son ombre plane depuis le 2 octobre sur la cour d‘assises spéciale qui s‘efforce d‘établir le rôle d‘Abdelkader Merah, lequel nie toute participation matérielle ou idéologique dans cette équipée meurtrière, qui a changé la perception en France de la menace terroriste islamiste.

“Mon frère est un musulman terroriste”, a fini par admettre du bout des lèvres Abdelkader Merah, lunettes sur le nez et longs cheveux réunis en catogan, pressé de questions par un avocat des parties civiles.

“Les actes sont graves mais ça reste mon petit frère. (...) Si j‘ai un enfant je l‘appellerai Mohamed en souvenir de mon petit frère”, avait-il dit auparavant. “En tant que musulman, je souhaite que mon petit frère soit au paradis.”

La cour s‘efforce notamment d‘établir s‘il a été le mentor de son cadet et s‘est rendu coupable d‘association de malfaiteurs terroriste criminelle en lui apportant conseils, documentation et soutien matériel. Ce qu‘il nie catégoriquement.

“Je ne me considère pas comme un musulman radical salafiste, je me considère comme un musulman orthodoxe”, a déclaré à la cour cet ancien délinquant et caïd de quartier réputé pour sa violence jusqu‘à sa “conversion” à un islam rigoriste en 2006.

Une “conversion” dans laquelle son cadet le suivra mais, selon lui, pas aussi sérieusement - “Il avait un comportement qui n‘était pas compatible avec un musulman pieux.”

Tous deux gravitent alors autour d‘un groupe salafiste implanté à Artigat, en Ariège, dirigé par l’“émir blanc” Olivier Corel, par où sont aussi passés les djihadistes Sabri Essid et les frères Clain avant de rejoindre l‘Etat islamique en Syrie.

Abdelkader présentera le père de Sabri Essid à sa mère, deux fois divorcée, afin qu‘elle se remarie en 2011 religieusement - mariage qui ne durera pas.

“LE DJIHAD EXISTE”

Et c‘est un frère Clain qui l‘aidera à trouver un logement au Caire, où il fera quatre séjours pour, a-t-il expliqué aux enquêteurs et à la barre, apprendre l‘arabe littéraire et approfondir sa connaissance du Coran.

L‘ancien caïd de quartier, qui avait gagné le surnom de “Ben Laden” en manifestant son enthousiasme pour les attentats du 11 septembre 2001 à New York et avait toute une documentation sur le fondateur d‘Al Qaïda, assure aujourd‘hui ne pas adhérer à son idéologie et n‘avoir fait allégeance à personne.

“Si je partageais cette idéologie, j‘irais moi-même” faire le djihad, a-t-il dit. “Dans ma perception de l‘islam, je n‘appelle aucunement à des actions violentes.”

Quant aux nombreux textes sur le djihad que les enquêteurs ont retrouvés dans sa bibliothèque, dans des disques durs et sur des clefs USB, il dit ne les avoir acquis ou téléchargés que dans une seule intention documentaire.

Il n‘en déclare pas moins qu’“aucun musulman ne peut nier que le djihad existe” et que certaines interprétations de cette notion peuvent amener “à tuer des innocents”.

“Moi (je le fais) avec mon coeur”, ajoute-t-il. “Le djihad, c‘est dans un contexte bien précis, le djihad c‘est quelque chose de noble”. Mais Mohamed, ajoute-t-il, “a fait un copié-collé, il n‘est pas entré dans l‘exégèse des textes”.

Il admet cependant avoir lui-même regardé des vidéos de décapitation - “Ça traînait dans le quartier.”

Il assure ne pas vivre en marge de la société française : “Je suis né en France et l‘islam ne nous apprend pas à renier nos origines, je suis musulman français.”

Mais il dit considérer la démocratie comme une religion, l‘Etat français comme un Etat “chrétien, démocratique et religieux” et ne pas reconnaître les lois “forgées par l‘homme”.

“Je reconnais uniquement les lois forgées par mon créateur, Allah”, insiste Abdelkader Merah, selon qui tout “musulman sincère” ne peut que souhaiter vivre sous les “lois d‘un califat bien dirigé, sous les lois d‘Allah”.

“J‘applique l‘Etat musulman dans mon coeur”, a-t-il expliqué avant de lancer plus tard au président de la cour : “Votre référence, c‘est le Code pénal, la mienne c‘est le Coran.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales unexpectedly fell in August, pointing to a slowdown in growth after a hot first half of the year and bolstering expectations the Bank of Canada will refrain from hiking interest rates again next week.

Separate data from Statistics Canada on Friday showed the annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent in September, matching forecasts and the highest in five months.

Markets and economists focused on the retail sales report, which showed sales fell 0.3 percent, against forecasts for a 0.5 percent increase. Volumes declined 0.7 percent, the biggest decrease since March 2016.

Analysts said the figures were in line with anticipated slower economic growth in the second half of the year after a strong performance that put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven.

“The Canadian economy is notably cooling down after the remarkable run it had up until about the middle part of the year,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

“The retail sales result does fit with that pattern of somewhat more modest activity.”

It also solidified bets the Bank of Canada will hold interest rates at 1.0 percent when it meets next week after two back-to-back increases. Market odds of no move rose to 81 percent from 72.8 percent before the data was released. [CA/POLL]

The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback following the two reports. [CAD/]

The decline in sales was led by a 2.5 percent drop at food and beverage stores, as well as stores that are typically linked to home purchases and renovations.

The increase in September’s inflation rate was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey, as well as more expensive food and shelter costs.

While underlying measures of inflation firmed somewhat, economists said they were still far enough away from the central bank’s 2 percent target to allow policymakers to take their time raising rates from here.

CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rose to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

Still, many are betting the central bank will have room to hike again in December, with market odds at 47.2 percent.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire employees for stores and for middle and higher management as low pay and a feeling of uncertainty clouds the industry following a spate of bankruptcies and store closures.
The staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.
“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.
The job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.
“So when the brick-and-mortar retail is really struggling, at that executive level, people are concerned about staying in retail.”

Retailers including Macy’s Inc and J.C. Penney have said they will hire the same or fewer seasonal workers for the holidays this year than last, while some, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc, have chosen not to hire temporary workers at all.

Sector observers have attributed this to brick-and-mortar retailers’ retreat under pressure from online players including Amazon, and firms themselves say they have simply taken a staggered approach to hiring this year that fills gaps slowly. Macy’s said holiday hiring was “off to a great start”.

But staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand.

The staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.

“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.

Her clients include Lowe’s Cos Inc, Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs.

U.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the “gig economy” and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool.

The hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month.

The job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.

“There just aren’t enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,” the site’s chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.

NO BONUS

The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs.

Recruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more.

“The jobs have become bigger,” Manpower Group’s Hassett said. “A manager will do more at the stores, they’ll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to.”

Wal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.

“We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,” said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart’s senior manager of corporate communications.

J.C. Penney said it was introducing paid time off for part-time hourly associates, starting from early 2018, to entice seasonal hires to stay beyond the holiday season.

Higher up the food chain, recruiters also point to bonuses that have lagged other industries as harming efforts to draw in and keep talented regional managers or heads of business lines.

“They (retailers) are paying lower bonuses and some companies have paid lower bonuses for a couple of years,” talent acquisition firm Korn Ferry’s retail expert Craig Rowley said.

An analysis by Korn Ferry of 40 big North American retailers showed that 73 percent paid little to no bonuses to senior executives for their performance in 2016. Thirty five percent paid no bonus, up from 25 percent last year.

“It’s the perception of where retail as an industry is going,” Manpower’s Hassett said. “So when the brick-and-mortar retail is really struggling, at that executive level, people are concerned about staying in retail.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s reversals in the past week on maintaining Obamacare subsidies to insurers are sowing new confusion over what kind of health insurance will be available to consumers, and at what price, when enrollment for 2018 begins in two weeks.

Trump said last week his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.

Since then, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated.

”We are worried that consumers on (Obamacare) plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes and that this will cause them to not seek out assistance,” said Bryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, which helps consumers choose and sign up for individual health plans offered under Obamacare.

Trump, who promised during his election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he has called a “disaster,” has said the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies.

By law, health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies.

Anticipating Trump’s move, insurers proposed higher prices on monthly premiums in 2018 to recoup the money. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates – a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.

LAST WORD ON SUBSIDIES?

The fate of the subsidies remained in limbo on Thursday. A senior White House aide said that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets.

A California court is expected to consider on Monday a request by Democratic attorneys general to keep the subsidies flowing until a legal challenge to Trump’s decision is resolved.

If the funding is not restored when 2018 enrollment opens on Nov. 1, many consumers will see premium rates that are on average 20 percent higher than they would have been otherwise.

Even before Trump’s decision on the subsidies, the Congressional Budget Office said the Republican president’s policies to roll back Obamacare enrollment efforts would lead to 4 million fewer people signing up for insurance in 2018 than previously forecast. The CBO still expects 11 million people to sign up for next year - an increase from this year’s enrollment of 10 million.

The federal government has already halted a subsidy payment to the insurance industry for October. But leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word.

Anthem Inc Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish told Reuters he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restating them through “potential congressional action” would affect pricing next year. Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.

Should the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates, or provide rebates for consumers.

“A midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,” said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. “Intermountain Healthcare would pursue this.”

Washington state’s insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical - even the next month - if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. But that could run up against federal government objections.

The Affordable Care Act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized, an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. At the same time, the administration is working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account Trump’s cut in subsidies for 2018.

The flags fly in Beijing. This is the week of the Communist Party Congress. And when official numbers show an economy exceeding official targets. Even so, Chinese stocks fell on their announcement. SOUNDBITE (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: "Question is, why is that? ... A six point eight percent rise in Q3. A bit of a slow down compared to the prior quarter - that was fully expected. The details of the data show no alarming facts as far as I can see." Debt is a major red alert. Ratings agencies estimate China's debt burden at almost three times economic output. Its central bank chief now warning of the danger .... That debt and currency pressures could trigger a collapse in asset prices. It's not the first time: this video shows him uttering similar words back in March. SOUNDBITE (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: "Debt to GDP is at a really unsustainable ratio ...Whilst that is appears to be the case we haven't really seen the you know the worst outcomes from such such risks." And in the meantime, its bid to promote consumer demand over older industries could be working ... Retail sales in September up over 10 per cent on the year. As could its efforts to deleverage a red-hot property market. SOUNDBITE (English) IG SENIOR ANALYST, CHRIS BEAUCHAMP, SAYING: "Fears of China's collapse have receded nicely from view at the moment. They seem to have managed to get the policy mix quite right and I think we should be relieved that the economy continues to grow." But growth in new construction has slowed. And property sales actually dropped in September for the first time in over two years. Efforts at control working - but also in danger of weighing on other sectors. That too a risk as China looks ahead to what its leaders call its 'new era'.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Shia LaBeouf pleaded guilty in a Georgia court on Thursday to one count of obstruction and was sentenced to community service and a year of probation following his July arrest on charges of public intoxication and disorderly conduct.

LaBeouf, 31, pleaded no contest to a charge of disorderly conduct and not guilty to public drunkenness, according to Savannah court records. He was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service, anger management, drug and alcohol evaluation and was fined $2,000.

Representatives for LaBeouf did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

The actor, best known for playing Sam Witwicky in the “Transformers” franchise, was arrested in the lobby of his hotel in downtown Savannah in July after he became unruly.

Videos released by police from bodycam footage showed the actor hurling expletive-filled barbs at officers as he questioned the reason for his arrest. He was booked into the Chatham County Jail and released a few hours later.

LaBeouf at the time put out a statement on Twitter saying he was “deeply ashamed” of his behavior and that his actions “warrant a very sincere apology to the arresting officers, and I am grateful for their restraint.”

“My outright disrespect for authority is problematic to say the least, and completely destructive to say the worst. It is a new low. A low I hope is a bottom. I have been struggling with addiction publicly for far too long, and I am actively taking steps toward securing my sobriety and hope I can be forgiven for my mistakes,” he said on Twitter.

The actor, who broke out as a child star on the Disney Channel, has had numerous brushes with the law in recent years. In January, he was arrested after a scuffle outside a New York museum where he was chanting: ”He will not divide us,” during a live-streamed protest against President Donald Trump.

In 2014, he was arrested in New York after disturbing a performance of the musical “Cabaret” on Broadway, which led to him pleading guilty to a disorderly conduct violation and receiving outpatient care for addiction.

LaBeouf most recently appeared at the Toronto Film Festival to promote his latest film “Borg vs McEnroe,” in which he plays tempestuous tennis star John McEnroe.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - XPO Logistics Inc said on Friday it is hiring more than 6,000 seasonal workers for the crucial peak holiday season, roughly 20 percent more than last year, as the third-largest publicly traded U.S. logistics company gears up for a surge in e-commerce deliveries.

XPO’s previously undisclosed plans reflect higher expectations for shipping demand for the holiday rush, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January.

The low U.S. jobless rate heading into peak this year poses a challenge for XPO and other major logistics and shipping companies, such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc, which must add thousands of temporary workers to handle as much as twice their normal package volumes.

XPO is a big player in e-commerce deliveries through its contract logistics and “last-mile” services for heavy goods, with a North American supply chain workforce of roughly 26,000 employees across 388 sites.

“E-commerce is the most exciting dynamic in the logistics industry,” Troy Cooper, XPO’s chief operating officer, told Reuters. “We’re constantly in recruiting mode, and we’re ramping that up for the holiday peak.”

Shoppers this year will shell out more on holiday gifting, according to industry surveys, buoyed by a labor market that is churning out more jobs every month, rising home prices and stock markets hovering at record highs.

Deloitte Consulting predicts sales of $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, with e-commerce sales jumping 18 percent to 21 percent.

FedEx expects to add more than 50,000 positions and offer extra hours to some current staff, while UPS said it would add 95,000 seasonal workers.

Seasonal hiring plans also give a glimpse into retailers’ holiday sales expectations as the companies make nearly a third of their annual sales during the period.

Amazon.com Inc said it would hire 120,000 workers in the U.S. this season, same as last year, joining a list of U.S. retailers cautious about their hiring plans amid an improving job market. [L4N1MN4RQ] [L4N1M142T]

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A week after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a blistering speech about Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military and economic force in the Islamic Republic has shown it has no intention of curbing its activities in the Middle East.

In defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran’s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region.

A senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was “acting crazy” and was following U.S. strategy of increasing “the shadow of war in the region”.

Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

“In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.

“The IRGC can’t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don’t back down.”

The day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards’ al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq’s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum.

The niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month.

Other Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.

“I don’t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,” she said. “He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.”

LIGHTNING ASSAULT

Within days, Iran’s mostly Shi‘ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran’s hand in Iraq.

Commanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi‘ite-led Iraqi central government’s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied.

A video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi‘ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office.

Iran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism.

After the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran.

FRONT-LINE PLAYER

Regional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi‘ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,” said Khamenei. “Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.”

Speaking after Trump’s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: ”From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...

“Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.”

The ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months.

Small boats from the Revolutionary Guards’ navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares.

In August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official.

Some recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually.

During the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.

POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT

The Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi‘ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.

“The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi‘ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards.

In early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.

“This is the first time that we’ve seen it used in this area,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack.

Dozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military.

Asked about the threat posed by Shi‘ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump’s speech, Dillon said: “We’re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.”

Trump’s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards’ political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet.

Since becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards’ economic influence and involvement in political matters.

Now, Rouhani’s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump’s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. “What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,” said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - O presidente da Oi, Marco Schroeder, afirmou nesta sexta-feira que a empresa está totalmente preparada para a assembleia de credores marcada para segunda-feira, mas que aguarda decisão do juiz de sua recuperação judicial a respeito do pedido de adiamento feito por alguns credores.

Falando a jornalistas após reunião de executivos do setor com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, Schroeder disse que “até o momento” a reunião de credores da Oi está confirmada para segunda-feira, mas caso seja adiada, a operadora vai prosseguir com as conversas.

Nesta sexta-feira, vários grupos de detentores de títulos da Oi pediram adiamento da assembleia de segunda-feira, incluindo o Comitê Internacional, o Grupo Ad Hoc, Banco do Brasil, BNDES e Caixa Econômica Federal.

A assembleia deveria ter ocorrido em 9 de outubro, mas no final de setembro ela foi adiada para a próxima segunda-feira após pedido da própria Oi ao juiz da recuperação judicial da empresa, Fernando Viana, da 7ª Vara Empresarial da Justiça do Rio de Janeiro.

“Existe espaço para convergir se tiver mais algumas semanas. Obviamente nós vamos aproveitar para ver se chega com um plano já na assembleia com um pouco mais de apoio consolidado”, disse o presidente da Oi em referência às negociações com credores.

Schroeder destacou que, se houver adiamento da assembleia, a próxima data já está marcada para 27 de novembro.

A assembleia é necessária para validação do plano de recuperação judicial apresentado pela companhia em 11 de outubro, no qual propôs limite de 25 por cento à conversão de títulos dívida em ações, bem abaixo do pretendido por detentores de títulos da companhia. Se houver rejeição, a falência da empresa poderá ser decretada.

A Oi entrou com pedido de recuperação judicial em junho do ano passado e até agora acionistas e detentores de títulos da empresa não chegaram a um acordo sobre a reestruturação da companhia que declarou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais e 55 mil credores.

Para a assembleia de segunda-feira, a Oi espera presença de até 5 mil pessoas ao anfiteatro do pavilhão 6 do centro de convenções Riocentro, que tem capacidade para 6 mil pessoas. A equipe organizadora do evento envolve cerca de 1.000 pessoas. Uma praça de alimentação foi também reservada no local e haverá 100 pontos para os credores votarem.

“Serão três dias longos pela frente”, disse uma fonte da operadora se referindo à maratona de discussões entre esta sexta-feira e a próxima segunda-feira.

TROCA POR INVESTIMENTOS

Em Brasília, o presidente da Oi destacou ainda que a empresa não está pedindo recursos públicos à União, mas condições de parcelamento de sua dívida semelhantes às que já existem no âmbito do Refis, por exemplo, além de a possibilidade de trocar multas por investimentos.

Schroeder seguiu na sequência para a Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel), que convocou para a próxima segunda feira, às 11h, reunião extraordinária de seu conselho diretor para analisar um pedido de acordo da Oi para conversão de multas em investimentos. Segundo uma fonte próxima ao assunto, este Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta (TAC) que será discutido na semana que vem envolve multas que somam cerca de 5 bilhões de reais.

As ações ordinárias da Oi tinham valorização de 0,7 por cento às 12:12 e os papéis preferenciais mostravam ganho de 0,92 por cento.

De acordo com os executivos que participaram do encontro com Meirelles nesta sexta-feira, a situação específica da Oi não foi abordada na reunião, que tratou especialmente de projeto sobre mudança do regime de concessão para autorização e eventual mudança na metodologia de cálculo de PIS-Cofins que oneraria o setor.

“Nós temos hoje um marco regulatório e uma carga tributária que são incompatíveis com o desenvolvimento futuro do setor”, disse o presidente da Vivo, Eduardo Navarro, citando quase 1 milhão de telefones públicos no Brasil que segundo ele não têm uso.

“Não viemos pedir para fazer nenhuma redução na carga tributária. Embora desejada, nós entendemos que o momento é inapropriado. Mas basicamente nós viemos pedir para não aumentar mais”, acrescentou.

De acordo com Navarro, o ministro apenas ouviu os presentes, sem tecer comentários a respeito do que era possível fazer.

Leicester City remarkably edged eventual title-winners Real Madrid, with their run to the quarter-finals earning the club 81.6 million euros, largely because the 2015-16 English champions had a bigger share of broadcasting rights money.

Zinedine Zidane’s Madrid, who lifted their second consecutive Champions League title, received just over 81 million euros.

Manchester City collected 50.2 million euros and Tottenham Hotspur earned 43.2 million euros despite the North London club’s early exit in the group stages.

A 50 million euros pool was shared by 20 clubs that took part in the playoffs. Ten clubs that qualified for the Champions League group stage received 2 million euros each, while 10 other sides that joined the Europa League group stage collected 3 million euros each.

Each club in the Champions League group stage were guaranteed a minimum payment of 12.7 million euros, with broadcasting revenue divided according to the television market in each country.

Last season’s Europa League winners Manchester United secured 44.5 million euros of payments, while runners-up Ajax Amsterdam received 16.1 million euros, largely on the back of a less lucrative television deal for the Dutch teams.

“Han sido muchos años de trayectoria en los que he puesto el cuerpo al límite en muchas ocasiones”, dijo Beitia en una rueda de prensa en su ciudad, Santander, acompañada de su entrenador Ramón Torralbo.

“La situación a la que me enfrento es que dejo mi carrera deportiva, todo lo que he aprendido me toca llevarlo a otros aspectos de la vida”.

Beitia, que ganó el oro el pasado año en salto de altura en los Juegos Olímpicos de Río de Janeiro, es la primera española campeona olímpica de atletismo.

La atleta ha combinado su cartera deportiva con la política desde que fue elegida como diputada en el Parlamento de Cantabria con el Partido Popular en 2011.

“Todos esos valores que he aprendido y todo lo que nos ha enseñado el deporte y me ha ocurrido con Ramón me toca llevarlos a otro aspecto de la vida”, añadió.

Beitia, de 38 años, fue la primera eliminada de la final de salto de altura en el Mundial de Londres del pasado agosto, en el que se enfrentó a lesiones que arruinaron su temporada, un año después de otra casi perfecta en la que se llevó el primer lugar en el Campeonatos Europeo en Ámsterdam, lo que se sumó a su triunfo olímpico.

Sin embargo, recibió el premio ‘Juego Limpio’ de la IAAF en el Mundial de Londres por consolar a su rival italiana Alessia Trost tras su eliminación.

Beitia se retiró temporalmente del deporte en 2012 tras estar cerca de conseguir su primera medalla olímpica en los Juegos de Londres, pero volvió a entrenar dos meses después.

“Se retira la más grande de nuestra historia”, dijo Raúl Chapado, presidente de la Federación Española de atletismo.

“Siempre ha sido un ejemplo dentro y fuera de las pistas. Más allá de sus grandes logros, ha difundido nuestro deporte entre los más jóvenes, dignificado el atletismo e inspirado a muchas niñas y niños”.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore-headquartered solar panel maker REC hopes to be exempt from potential U.S. restrictions on imports following a recent trade finding that said no significant injury to the United States had been caused by makers including those from Australia, Canada and Singapore.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce by early next year measures which his administration will take to limit imports after the U.S. International Trade Commission found in September that U.S. panel makers had been harmed by cheap imports.

Many companies have warned that a solar trade dispute involving potential import tariffs between the United States and other countries could cost thousands of jobs and slow down the development of the clean energy technology.

The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) in September found injury from imports from several countries with which it has free trade agreements (FTA), including Mexico and South Korea.

However, USITC said that “with respect to other FTA countries” including Canada, Australia or Singapore, there was “not a substantial cause of serious injury”.

Still, REC Chief Executive Steve O‘Neil said the industry was watching closely.

“We’re certainly paying a lot of attention to it. We will know more once the Trump administration makes their final ruling,” he told Reuters.

More than 90 percent of the world’s solar panel-making capacity is in Asia, with China accounting for 70 percent of the output followed by southeast Asia, O‘Neil said.

High costs, the lack of raw materials and infrastructure make it hard for U.S. solar panel producers to compete with those in Asia, forcing several U.S. solar makers into bankruptcy in the past years.

REC was founded in Norway but is headquartered in Singapore and majority-owned by China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) [CNNCC.UL].

The company has production capacity of 1.5 gigawatts (GW) and sells about half of its panels in the United States, 30 percent to Europe and the rest in Asia.

Despite the concentration in Asia, O‘Neil said the global solar market remained fragmented, with hundreds of panel makers competing and no single firm having a market share of more than 8 percent.

“We know consolidation is coming and maturing will happen, but right now, it’s still a race for scale, for technology, and to emerge as a winner in the solar-panel manufacturing end of the market.”

Rooftop solar is growing rapidly thanks to a near 30 percent drop in the cost of solar panels since 2016 and government policies that allow consumers to sell their excess solar power into the grid.

“This year we’ve tripled our sales in Australia,” O‘Neil said.

The world is expected to add up to 100 GW of solar power capacity this year that will bring the cumulative installed capacity to 300-350 GW, O‘Neil said.

Besides the United States, REC sees India, Europe and Southeast Asia as growing markets to tap, he said.

(For a graphic on 'World solar power capacity', click reut.rs/2l2ZvsX)

NEW TECHNOLOGIES

O‘Neil said there were several forms of experimental technologies with which the sector hoped to make further inroads.

It also includes finding ways to improve the performance of single panels.

O‘Neil said that off-grid solar power as well as hybrid systems, including working together with batteries were “getting some traction.”

Solar power is seen to have large potential in regions that are not connected to power grids, such as many of Southeast Asia’s remote islands.

So far, most of this back-up has been provided by diesel generators, but thanks to improving technology, batteries are being increasingly used.

“If you replace diesel in an island with a solar system, the payback is astounding,” O‘Neil said.

REC Solar has also participated in the testing of floating solar PV in Singapore’s Tengah reservoir as land-scarce countries explore options to tap on solar power, he said.

Strong sales of SK-II skincare products in Asia made Procter & Gamble's quarterly profit look better, but it couldn't mask tepid quarterly sales. Sales overall inched up just 1 percent and missed analysts' forecasts. Cutting into that growth: a 22 percent sales drop in its grooming business despite cutting prices. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi, who believes P&G shares are overvalued, said, "Grooming was especially weak." P&G's shares dropped at the market open Friday, chipping into their nearly 9 percent gain this year. Profit rose and beat forecasts. Making the biggest contribution to the bottom line: higher sales of fabric softeners and laundry detergents like Tide and Febreze. The results come just one week after activist investor Nelson Peltz narrowly lost his bid for a board seat at P&G in a historic proxy battle. He had pushed for a re-organization, saying the company was losing market share because of what he called its "suffocating bureaucracy." Looking ahead, P&G said it's sticking to its full-year sales and profit forecasts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s reversals in the past week on maintaining Obamacare subsidies to insurers are sowing new confusion over what kind of health insurance will be available to consumers, and at what price, when enrollment for 2018 begins in two weeks.

Trump said last week his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.

Since then, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated.

”We are worried that consumers on (Obamacare) plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes and that this will cause them to not seek out assistance,” said Bryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, which helps consumers choose and sign up for individual health plans offered under Obamacare.

Trump, who promised during his election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he has called a “disaster,” has said the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies.

By law, health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies.

Anticipating Trump’s move, insurers proposed higher prices on monthly premiums in 2018 to recoup the money. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates – a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.

LAST WORD ON SUBSIDIES?

The fate of the subsidies remained in limbo on Thursday. A senior White House aide said that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets.

A California court is expected to consider on Monday a request by Democratic attorneys general to keep the subsidies flowing until a legal challenge to Trump’s decision is resolved.

If the funding is not restored when 2018 enrollment opens on Nov. 1, many consumers will see premium rates that are on average 20 percent higher than they would have been otherwise.

Even before Trump’s decision on the subsidies, the Congressional Budget Office said the Republican president’s policies to roll back Obamacare enrollment efforts would lead to 4 million fewer people signing up for insurance in 2018 than previously forecast. The CBO still expects 11 million people to sign up for next year - an increase from this year’s enrollment of 10 million.

The federal government has already halted a subsidy payment to the insurance industry for October. But leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word.

Anthem Inc Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish told Reuters he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restating them through “potential congressional action” would affect pricing next year. Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.

Should the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates, or provide rebates for consumers.

“A midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,” said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. “Intermountain Healthcare would pursue this.”

Washington state’s insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical - even the next month - if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. But that could run up against federal government objections.

The Affordable Care Act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized, an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. At the same time, the administration is working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account Trump’s cut in subsidies for 2018.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has teamed up with the National Football League’s Green Bay Packers in a $10 million partnership intended to spur tech innovation in Wisconsin, the software company said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: A sign marks the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. on January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo

The partnership is part of a trend by tech companies to connect with the U.S. Midwest following last November’s surprise election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. Trump was carried largely by rural states that embraced his criticisms of globalization and admonishments of Silicon Valley for what he described as an overreliance on immigrant workers.

For Microsoft, the outreach efforts serve as a way to connect with folks across the United States, said Brad Smith, the tech company’s chief legal officer.

“We are probably not going to find the technology breakthrough for the future of farming in downtown San Francisco,“ Smith told Reuters. ”We’re much more likely to find it in Green Bay, Wisconsin.”

Through the partnership, known as TitletownTech, the Packers and Microsoft will each contribute $5 million to invest in startups from around Wisconsin. This is part of a larger initiative by Microsoft called TechSpark to form similar partnerships in North Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.

Microsoft in July also committed itself to use television broadcast spectrum to bring broadband internet to 2 million rural Americans within five years.

“For communities like ours in the manufacturing belt, this is going to get us to where we need to be in order to be competitive well into the future,” Ed Policy, Green Bay Packers general counsel, said in an interview on Wednesday.

TechSpark is a long-term strategy Microsoft hopes will yield new customers, new employees and benefit more Americans, Smith said.

The origins of what became TechSpark occurred the day after Trump’s Nov. 8 election win, when Smith wrote a blog post saying Microsoft needed to “promote inclusive economic growth that helps everyone move forward.”

Microsoft is not alone in its outreach efforts to the American heartland.

So far in 2017, Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has traveled to U.S. states he had not previously visited. Similarly, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook in April spoke to his alma mater Auburn University in Alabama, and the iPhone maker has said it will invest $1.3 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, to build a new data center and an additional $1 billion to expand its data center in Reno, Nevada.

Apple in May also announced a $1 billion fund for U.S. manufacturing programs. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in September announced plans to open a second headquarters away from Seattle, promising to bring $5 billion in investments to the chosen community.

”The 2016 presidential election was a wake-up call for many Americans, especially those in the ‘bubble’ of coastal cities,” said Jessica Alter, co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, a nonprofit formed to promote tech worker participation in progressive and moderate political campaigns in local U.S. elections.

“For big companies like Microsoft and Facebook that means connecting with people outside of their headquarter cities,” Alter said on Wednesday.

TechSpark comes as more regulators and lawmakers around the globe turn a sharper eye toward Silicon Valley and question the way companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google are regulated.

“We have a responsibility to be reaching out to every part of the country,” Smith said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

"I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it," said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority.
The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.
A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.
Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.
A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

Indian fuel demand typically eases in the third quarter as monsoon rains hit construction, industrial activity and reduces consumption of transport fuels.
Capacity addition is also driving up India’s oil imports.
India, which imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, has emerged as a key driver for growth in global oil demand.
OPEC expects India’s oil demand to rise by 150 percent to 10.1 million bpd by 2040 from about 4 million bpd.
India’s fuel demand is also expected to rise in the fourth quarter because new tax rules have made two-wheelers and cars cheaper, said Kumaran.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India imported a record 4.83 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in September as several refiners resumed operations after extensive maintenance to meet rising local fuel demand.

The world’s third-biggest oil importer shipped in 4.2 percent more oil last month than a year earlier and about 19 percent more than in the previous month, ship-tracking data from industry sources and Thomson Reuters Analytics showed.

“There was heavy maintenance at some refineries in July-August. All those refineries have come online, so naturally refiners will have to boost purchases to meet local demand,” said Senthil Kumaran, senior analyst at energy consultant FGE.

Maintenance turnaround at some refineries led to Indian Oil Corp deferring the shutdown of its 300,000 bpd coastal Paradip refinery to April-March. [REF/A]

During the first nine months of the year India’s oil imports rose 1.8 percent to about 4.4 million bpd, with most supplies coming from the Middle East, followed by Africa and Latin America.

Indian fuel demand typically eases in the third quarter as monsoon rains hit construction, industrial activity and reduces consumption of transport fuels. That provides refiners with an opportunity to carry out maintenance.

Capacity addition is also driving up India’s oil imports.

The country added 170,000 bpd of capacity at plants owned by Bharat Petroleum Corp and HPCL-Mittal Energy, which are gradually ramping up crude runs.

India, which imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, has emerged as a key driver for growth in global oil demand.

The South Asian nation is set to surpass China as the fastest-growing oil products market in Asia, with fuel demand growing by 6.1 percent in 2018, according to a recent report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

FGE expects India’s fuel demand to rise by about 4.5 percent this year to 4.2 million bpd and by 5.1-5.2 percent in 2018.

India is increasing refining capacity to keep pace with the expected growth in fuel demand as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to boost the manufacturing sector.

Global oil majors Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, BP, Shell and Total are vying to tap a sizeable share of the fast-growing Indian fuel markets.

OPEC expects India’s oil demand to rise by 150 percent to 10.1 million bpd by 2040 from about 4 million bpd.

India’s fuel demand is also expected to rise in the fourth quarter because new tax rules have made two-wheelers and cars cheaper, said Kumaran.[O/INDIA2]

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The title of Rohit Shetty’s latest film is prescient. He’s made so many “Golmaal” films that it is impossible to tell them apart. So you stop bothering with numbers, because you know it is going to run with the same formula all over again and engineered towards making that elusive thing Bollywood likes to call a “commercial blockbuster”.

Handout photo

Ajay Devgn, Arshad Warsi, Kunal Khemu, Shreyas Talpade and Tusshar Kapoor reprise their roles from the earlier films. The women, of course, are dispensable and easily replaced. This time, the setting is an orphanage in the hill town of Ooty. Gopal (Devgn), an orphan with anger issues and an irrational fear of ghosts, decides to leave town with friend Laxman (Talpade) after an altercation with three other orphans. Many years later, all of them meet at the last rites of the founder of the orphanage, and discover that all is not well.

An evil builder is out to destroy the orphanage, a spirit seems to haunt the house where the men are staying, and the mysterious Damini (Parineeti Chopra) seems to have a secret that only puzzles people in the film. Audiences can see it coming a mile away.

But for all its predictability, “Golmaal Again” is funny. The first half of the film is full of good slapstick comedy, combined with an inspired running joke on Nana Patekar. Warsi and Kemmu display excellent comic timing, while Johnny Lever brings his dependable comedic genius to the screen to deliver some truly rollicking moments. Tabu as the benevolent librarian who guides the men on their mission is understated and efficient.

But it is too good to last. As the second half rolls in, things get sluggish, the jokes get rarer and the mission to save the orphanage seems to be taking a tad too long. Shetty’s story doesn’t have the emotional heft or enough jokes to entertain us for 151 minutes – the film’s runtime.

But for what it is worth, this film stays clear of sexist jokes, toilet humour and making fun of the disabled. For that alone, “Golmaal Again” is one up on its earlier iterations.

Overall global chip market growth this year will likely be 16 percent, TSMC said.

TSMC forecast October-December revenue at $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with an operating margin of 37 to 39 percent.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) said demand from mobile device makers is likely to push October-December revenue growth to 10 percent from three months prior, in a quarter when client Apple Inc begins sales of its iPhone X.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker also expects annual revenue growth of 5 to 10 percent for the next few years, and capital expenditure slightly above $10 billion, executives said at an earnings briefing on Thursday.

TSMC earlier reported a 7.1 percent fall in third-quarter profit, a slightly milder decline than analysts estimated. Revenue rose 1.5 percent, marginally beating the firm’s forecast.

“Even though demand was slightly dampened by supply chain inventory reduction, our customers’ third-quarter growth was largely healthy,” said co-Chief Executive Officer Mark Liu.

The results come soon after TSMC named Liu as successor in June to retiring Chairman Morris Chang - widely regarded as the father of Taiwan’s chip industry - leaving C.C. Wei as sole CEO. They also come days before TSMC celebrates its 30th anniversary and about a week before iPhone X pre-orders begin.

Demand for increasingly capable smartphones as well as for servers for cloud computing has seen chipmakers’ share prices surge this year, with TSMC jumping 68 percent. Overall global chip market growth this year will likely be 16 percent, TSMC said.

But competition is set to increase. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world’s biggest memory chip maker, plans to triple its share of the contract chipmaking market within five years. There is also the threat from mainland China which is fostering a domestic chip industry.

“In terms of a lot of fabs (fabrication plants) in mainland China, we don’t like it but we are very competitive. We’ll continue to compete of course and maintain our market share,” Wei said at the earnings briefing.

Profit was T$89.93 billion ($2.98 billion) in July-September versus the T$88.19 billion average of 21 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue was $8.32 billion and operating margin was 38.9 percent.

TSMC forecast October-December revenue at $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with an operating margin of 37 to 39 percent.

During the quarter, on Nov. 3, Apple will begin shipping the iPhone X which is widely expected to carry TSMC-made chips. The device follows the recently launched iPhone 8 whose sales are reportedly slower than those of predecessors.

For all of 2017, TSMC said revenue growth will likely be close to the high end of its 5 to 10 percent target range.

The firm also said 2017 will mark a milestone in annual capital spending as it raised its forecast by 8 percent to $10.8 billion, mainly to accelerate capacity build-up of 7 nanometer chip manufacturing technology.

BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces took control on Friday of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said.

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad’s wishes.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties.

The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.

The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.

The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.

Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

Iraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.

Sistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.

ACCUSATIONS

Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Iraq’s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war.

Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.

Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.

“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.

An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.

Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

SOUNDBITE (French) NOVESPACE DIRECTOR, THIERRY GHARIB, SAYING: "We have research teams on board which try to study phenomena which cannot be studied when on the ground because those phenomena are hidden by the force of gravity. So that's why we give them the possibility to go weightless and see what happens with fluid physics, human physiology, biology." Zero gravity is achieved by the so called parabolic flight of the plane --ascending at a sharp 50 degree angle, reaching a certain altitude before free falling over an arc following the earth's curvature. Inside the aircraft, experiments take place to help astronauts grow plants on future trips to Mars. SOUNDBITE (French) STUDENT AT THE FRENCH SPACE RESEARCH CENTRE CNES, LAUCAS PINOL, SAYING: "We are trying to see how drops of water behave when weightless, the drops will be bigger than those when on Earth, they will move slower, something that you can't do with Earth's gravity." Here scientists use virtual reality goggles to improve communication in space where the sense of direction gets lost. The scientists hope that their contributions will help astronauts stay afloat during tricky situations when help is far and away.

BERLIM (Reuters) - A chanceler da Alemanha, Angela Merkel, iniciou nesta sexta-feira a primeira rodada de conversas para a formação de uma chamada coalizão “Jamaica” entre três forças necessária para se manter no poder, ou correrá o risco de ver seu reinado acabar depois de 12 anos.
“A política europeia é muito importante”, afirmou Merkel, acrescentando que, em conversas bilaterais ocorridos no início desta semana, prometeu aos líderes do FDP e dos Verdes que os consultará para tomar qualquer decisão de peso.
Merkel tem conseguido conduzir a Europa em meio às crises de refugiados e da zona do euro em parte graças a seu domínio na política alemã.
Uma pesquisa Infratest Dimap para a ARD mostrou que 83 por cento dos alemães querem que os partidos façam um acordo de meio termo.
Os negociadores dos três partidos se reunirão às 16h30 pela primeira vez desde as conversas bilaterais do começo da semana.

BERLIM (Reuters) - A chanceler da Alemanha, Angela Merkel, iniciou nesta sexta-feira a primeira rodada de conversas para a formação de uma chamada coalizão “Jamaica” entre três forças necessária para se manter no poder, ou correrá o risco de ver seu reinado acabar depois de 12 anos.

As conversas entre o bloco conservador, de Merkel, o partido pró-empresariado FDP e os Verdes estão sendo apresentadas como “exploratórias”, mas os negociadores pretendem entrar em detalhes das políticas tributária e orçamentária em sua primeira reunião propriamente dita.

A combinação tripartite, apelidada de coalizão “Jamaica” por causa das três cores dos partidos --preto, amarelo e verde, como as da bandeira jamaicana-- é inédita em nível nacional.

Merkel, enfraquecida pelo crescimento da extrema-direita na eleição nacional do mês passado, precisa fazer a aliança complicada funcionar, já que o Partido Social-Democrata (SPD), seu antigo parceiro na “grande coalizão” anterior, disse que quer se reformular na oposição depois de sofrer seu pior resultado eleitoral desde 1933.

“Precisamos fazer tudo ao nosso alcance para ter sucesso nesta constelação que temos”, disse Volker Kauder, líder da União Social-Cristã (CDU), de Merkel, no Parlamento, à rede de televisão ARD.

“Precisamos proporcionar um governo estável ao país. Temos grandes discussões acontecendo na Europa. A situação política no exterior se tornou complicada. Por isso precisamos de um governo estável”.

Como sinal de que as mãos de Merkel estão atadas no nível europeu, a chanceler disse aos repórteres após uma cúpula da União Europeia de dois dias em Bruxelas que as grandes decisões sobre o futuro da zona do euro terão que esperar pela formação do novo governo em Berlim.

“A política europeia é muito importante”, afirmou Merkel, acrescentando que, em conversas bilaterais ocorridos no início desta semana, prometeu aos líderes do FDP e dos Verdes que os consultará para tomar qualquer decisão de peso.

Merkel tem conseguido conduzir a Europa em meio às crises de refugiados e da zona do euro em parte graças a seu domínio na política alemã. Agora este domínio está recuando -– no mês passado seus conservadores tiveram seu pior desempenho eleitoral desde 1949.

Uma pesquisa Infratest Dimap para a ARD mostrou que 83 por cento dos alemães querem que os partidos façam um acordo de meio termo. Os negociadores dos três partidos se reunirão às 16h30 pela primeira vez desde as conversas bilaterais do começo da semana.

Uber opens up Paris travel database to help city planners

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] said on Friday it would open up its trove of travel data in Paris to the public to help city officials and urban planners better understand transportation needs, as the company seeks to woo national authorities.

The U.S. ride-hailing app collects huge amounts of data from the billions of trips taken by customers which it uses to improve its services and has recently started to make it available for a number of cities including Washington D.C., Sydney and Boston.

“We get asked all the time ‘Is there any way you can share more data? We’d love to see where people are traveling in our city’,” Adam Gromis, who is responsible for environmental sustainability at Uber, told Reuters.

The service, called Uber Movement, shows how long it takes to make a journey between two points in a city at different times of the day.

To respect users’ privacy, Uber Movement uses only aggregated anonymised data.

Uber, which launched in Paris in 2011, has had a rocky relationship with regulators across Europe who have accused it of flouting their traditional licensing rules.

Protests by taxi drivers against the smartphone app turned violent in 2015 when Paris cabbies overturned cars and burned tyres.

Uber has suffered a tumultuous few months that led to former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick being forced out after a series of boardroom controversies and regulatory battles in a number of U.S. states and around the world.

Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has struck a less confrontational approach than his predecessor - particularly in London where Uber is challenging a decision by the transport regulator to strip it of its operating license in the city.

“As a technology company we can play a role in helping cities make data-driven decisions for the benefit of the environment and its citizens,” Alexandre Droulers, Uber’s general manager for new mobility in western Europe, said.

Transport planning usually relies on expensive household travel surveys which are conducted on average every 10 years in the Paris region, making Uber’s data a lot more up to date.

The UK's decision to leave the EU has at times left British Prime Minister Theresa May looking like the unpopular kid at school. Not so on Thursday (October 19). The choreography on the first day of this European Union summit showing May talking animatedly with the EU's most important leaders - France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel. That as May urged a new dynamic on Brexit talks. At a summit dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May appealed to EU leaders to help her silence her critics at home and break a deadlock in the talks. Merkel responding to that with words of support. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING: "Contrary to how it is sometimes represented in the British press - this process is moving forward step by step. Sometimes the impression is given that after just a few weeks we should now already be announcing the end. To be clear, I find that absolutely absurd." Talks have stalled largely over how much Britain owes when it leaves the bloc. EU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill. They are expected on Friday (October 20) to set a target of December for London to improve its divorce settlement offer. But in a conciliatory gesture they are also likely to call on their staff to prepare for the next stage of talks. That may be enough for May to stave off calls by several Brexit campaigners back home for her to walk away from the negotiating table.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Mobile network gear maker Ericsson said it had detected signs of improvement after posting a steeper than expected quarterly loss on Friday, helping send its languishing shares up as much as 5 percent.

Once the world’s top maker of mobile network equipment, Sweden’s Ericsson faces a declining market for older network 2G, 3G and 4G gear while needing to step up investments in next-generation 5G equipment to retain market share.

After replacing management in 2016, Ericsson has embarked on a restructuring programme to exit unprofitable network services deals and reverse course after an ill-timed bid to diversify beyond core telecom markets.

“We see a stabilized performance in a challenging market. We also see signs of improvements in our performance,” Chief Executive Boerje Ekholm said on a conference call.

“Yes, there is still a long way to go ... but we are also seeing signs that we are stabilizing our performance and that we are getting control of our projects and products,” Ekholm said.

The Swedish company posted its fourth consecutive money-losing quarter, with an operating loss of 4.8 billion Swedish crowns ($588.7 million) that was 37 percent worse than the average loss estimated by analysts.

Third-quarter sales of 47.8 billion crowns were down 3 percent in constant currencies and the company warned its usual year-end sales bounce would not be as big as in previous years.

5G WON‘T WAIT

Competition from China’s Huawei and Finland’s Nokia, as well as weak emerging markets and falling spending by telecoms operators, has hurt Ericsson, while demand for next-generation 5G technology is still several years away.

While it cut 3,000 jobs during the third quarter, it added 1,100 recruits in research and development in order to be ready to meet eventual demand for 5G networks.

Sales were stable in North America while growing in Brazil and the Middle East, but these positive trends were offset by a decline in China, Ericsson said.

In the current quarter, it said network sales would not grow as fast because Chinese network operators are slashing spending on higher speed 4G mobile networks after a massive building spree in recent years.

Ericsson said it had increased its share of 4G networks in China, which was vital to ensure it wins repeat business in future 5G network there. China will put pressure on overall fourth-quarter margins in its network business, it said.

It is also renegotiating or exiting unprofitable service contracts in its networks unit as it aims to double its operating margin to 12 percent after 2018, a target analysts see as unlikely. It has exited or renegotiated 13 out of 42 contracts it considers problematic, improving profits.

Restructuring weighed on the quarter as the company repeated it aimed to reduce costs by at least 10 billion crowns, or around $1.2 billion, from the middle of next year.

Ericsson shares shot up just over 5 percent in early trade and were up 3.3 percent at 50.4 crowns by 0942 GMT, but remain some 4 percent lower for the year to date.

SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O governo federal vai prever no orçamento da União de 2018 uma arrecadação de 7,7 bilhões de reais com o processo de privatização da Eletrobras, disse nesta sexta-feira o ministro interino de Minas e Energia, Paulo Pedrosa, ao participar de debate sobre a estatal na Federação das Indústrias do Estado de São Paulo (Fiesp).

O dinheiro entrará para o Tesouro com o pagamento pela Eletrobras de um bônus em troca de contratos mais vantajosos para suas hidrelétricas. A estatal deverá obter o dinheiro para o pagamento com uma oferta de ações que reduzirá a União a uma fatia minoritária na companhia.

Os recursos de privatizações devem ajudar o governo federal a tentar cumprir suas metas orçamentárias.

Pedrosa disse ainda que os planos para a privatização preveem também limites à participação de investidores na Eletrobras.

“Estamos investindo (na ideia de privatização) para trazer resultado e criar uma corporação... com uma limitação, em que nenhum acionista tenha mais de 10 por cento do bloco de controle, uma empresa com lógica privada”, disse Pedrosa.

O diretor-geral da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), Romeu Rufino, também presente no debate, disse que para o órgão regulador é indiferente se uma empresa como a Eletrobras tem controle estatal ou privado, mas ressaltou que ineficiências da companhia nos últimos anos têm punido os consumidores com custos mais elevados.

Ele deu como exemplos o atraso na entrega de obras devido à crise financeira enfrentada pela empresa.

“O grupo Eletrobras assumiu compromissos que não conseguiu entregar, por várias dificuldades. Tanto no segmento de transmissão quanto no de geração, convivemos com atrasos que não foram indiferentes para o setor como um todo, principalmente para o consumidor. Afetou o consumidor de forma significativa... isso não pode continuar”, disse.

Ele também defendeu a venda das distribuidoras de eletricidade da Eletrobras como uma questão essencial para a própria sobrevivência dessas empresas, que são responsáveis pelo atendimento a Estados do Norte e Nordeste e enfrentam pesados e recorrentes prejuízos.

Mas o diretor ressaltou que o modelo previsto pelo governo para viabilizar a desestatização da Eletrobras, que prevê uma mudança nos contratos de hidrelétricas antigas da companhia, poderá impactar o consumidor, uma vez que as usinas poderão vender sua produção a preços maiores.

Essas hidrelétricas hoje entregam a energia às distribuidoras por preços muito baixos, em um chamado “regime de cotas”. O processo de mudança nos contratos desses empreendimentos tem sido chamado de “descotização”.

Rufino defendeu que o governo precisa ter cuidado nesse processo para evitar uma forte elevação das tarifas.

“A descotização, isoladamente, não vai na direção da modicidade tarifária. A privatização da Eletrobras, se tem um ganho de eficiência, então ela vai nesse sentido, sim. Uma coisa compensa a outra? Não sei.”

Para o ex-diretor da Aneel Edvaldo Santana, agora presidente da Abrace, associação que representa grandes indústrias, a Eletrobras nos últimos anos passou a assumir diversos custos que depois acabaram sendo repassado aos consumidores.

“Independentemente do problema ideológico, a privatização da Eletrobras é um problema de custo. Ela se tornou uma agregadora de custos... a privatização, com a descotização, aumenta a tarifa... mas os ganhos compensam tudo isso, não precisa fazer nenhuma conta, só de acabar com esse ciclo vicioso de aumento de custos”, afirmou ele, também presente na Fiesp.

O governo tem falado em concluir todo o processo de privatização da elétrica federal até o final do primeiro semestre de 2018.

Bank of America (ABC.N) jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s (AAPL.O) 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks.

Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.

The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

“It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

“Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.”

Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

The S&P and the Dow were on track to post gains for the sixth straight week and the Nasdaq for the fourth straight week.

At 11:14 a.m. ET (1514 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 77.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 23,240.82, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 7.26 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,569.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 22.59 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,627.66.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.89 percent gain in the financial index .SPSY.

PayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.

General Electric (GE.N) shares slipped 3.18 percent after the industrial conglomerate reported a profit miss and slashed its earnings forecast.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) dipped 3.19 percent after the company’s sales narrowly missed estimates.

Celgene (CELG.O) slumped more than 10 percent after the company decided to abandon testing a drug to treat Crohn’s disease.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,672 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,745 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

The Republican-controlled Senate voted by 51-to-49 late on Thursday for the measure, clearing a hurdle for tax cuts that would add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Investors betting on faster economic growth as a result bought riskier assets while bond holders reduced their positions on worries that inflation and federal borrowing could rise.

Higher bond yields increase pressure on bullion because gold does not offer a yield, while a stronger dollar makes it more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Investors may also see tax cuts as a cause for higher U.S. interest rates, said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. Higher rates would push up bond yields and the dollar.

Spot gold was down 0.6 percent at $1,282.33 an ounce at 1422 GMT, taking losses this week to 1.7 percent.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery were 0.5 percent lower at $1,283.60 an ounce.

“We seem to once again be ready to test technical support around $1,275-$1,270,” said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.

“If we look at the chart, it’s a classic head and shoulders pattern here and the danger is we’ll break lower to a level at $1,250 or even below.”

Analysts at Commerzbank said gold’s failure to remain above $1,300 could prompt speculative investors betting on higher prices to exit their positions, pushing prices lower.

The net long position of money managers in Comex gold has fallen from a peak in early September but is still at an elevated level.

Meanwhile, Trump could announce his choice for the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve as early as next week after he interviewed five candidates including current chief Janet Yellen.

A report on Thursday suggested Trump was leaning towards Fed Governor Jerome Powell, perceived as a less hawkish candidate.

The European Central Bank is expected to say on Oct. 26 it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to 40 billion euros from 60 billion euros in January, a Reuters poll showed.

In other precious metals, silver was down 0.2 percent at $17.16 an ounce, taking its fall this week to around 1 percent.

Platinum was flat at $921.20 an ounce and palladium was up 1.7 percent at $975. Both metals were down on the week.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s annual inflation rate rose to the highest in five months in September on higher prices for gasoline and food, moving closer to the central bank’s target, data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday.
REUTERS/Mark BlinchThe annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent last month from 1.4 percent in August, the highest since April and matching economists’ forecasts.
Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.
Food prices rose 1.4 percent, partly due to some of last year’s dampening effects starting to wear off.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s annual inflation rate rose to the highest in five months in September on higher prices for gasoline and food, moving closer to the central bank’s target, data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday.

The annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent last month from 1.4 percent in August, the highest since April and matching economists’ forecasts.

Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

The Bank of Canada, which is largely expected to hold interest rates at 1 percent next week after two back-to-back increases, has an inflation target of 2 percent.

Overall, prices were up in six of the eight major components of the consumer price index, led by a 3.8 percent annual increase in transportation costs. That was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey.

Food prices rose 1.4 percent, partly due to some of last year’s dampening effects starting to wear off. Higher shelter costs also boosted inflation, with prices up 1.4 percent.

Russia's move appears to be part of a strategy to boost its Middle Eastern political and economic influence. Rosneft's investment comes as Kurdistan's relations with the central government in Baghdad have hit crisis point. Kurdistan held an independence referendum last month, angering neighbours Iran and Turkey. The U.S. called the referendum a provocation. But Moscow has effectively supported the vote, saying it understood Kurdish aspirations for independence. Rosneft says it would own 60 percent of the pipeline, with current operator KAR Group retaining 40 percent.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

"People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth," said REC's O'Neil. "It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

"Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land," said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Calling its results “horrible” and “unacceptable,” General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new chief executive vowed on Friday to shed more than $20 billion worth of assets and hold executives accountable for failing to deliver profits.

His comments came as GE badly missed Wall Street expectations and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares down 2.9 percent to $22.90.

GE’s good businesses are being held back by others that “drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward,” Chief Executive John Flannery said on a conference with analysts.

“We will have a simpler, more focused portfolio” in coming months, he said.

Flannery declined to say what is on the chopping block, details he is due to unveil on Nov. 13, though he voiced support for GE’s 3D-printing and digital-industrial businesses.

But analysts had clear ideas: “GE will likely sell transportation, lighting and about anything else that isn’t nailed down and very core,” analyst Scott Davis at Melius Research wrote in a note on Friday.

Investors are pushing for big change after being frustrated for more than a decade by poor returns at the 125-year-old maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment.

Even before the stock’s decline on Friday, GE produced a total return - share appreciation plus reinvested dividends - of just 0.64 percent over the last 16 years. A $1,000 investment on the day former CEO Jeff Immelt started his tenure would be worth $1,006.38 today. Immelt stepped down Aug. 1.

As proof of GE’s new approach to performance, outgoing CFO Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.

“That sense of accountability has to start with me,” he said. “We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me.”

GE’s poor financial performance in the third quarter showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE’s highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark “robust dialog,” he said and shedding some of the 18 directors was “being examined.”

GE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.

GE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.

GE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said. Industrial cash flow from operations fell mainly ”because of lower power volume, resulting in lower earnings and higher inventory.”

Profit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.

Revenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHGE.N).

BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces took control on Friday of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said.

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad’s wishes.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties.

The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.

The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.

The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.

Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

Iraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.

Sistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.

ACCUSATIONS

Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Iraq’s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war.

Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.

Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.

“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.

An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.

Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

Verizon's quarterly profit didn't grow, but America's largest carrier added more phone subscribers than expected. And its revenue rose, beating analysts' estimates. The company gained 274,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill. Verizon shares rose at the start of trading Thursday, chipping away at their nearly 9 percent loss this year. Wells Fargo senior analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said, "Verizon delivered a second consecutive quarter of strong results, particularly in its wireless segment." Fewer customers defected than expected; the so-called churn rate was less than 1 percent. Analysts say many customers are delaying their decisions to switch carriers until the fourth quarter. That's when Apple is expected to launch sales of its iPhone X. Verizon, however, lost video subscribers in the quarter - some 18,000. Consumers have been shifting from pay-TV packages to cheaper streaming services like Netflix. AT&T and Comcast had earlier warned of video subscriber losses.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Speaking as a folksy physician running for Virginia governor, Democrat Ralph Northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight Donald Trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.

But Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.

The balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.

He is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

The Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.

After denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.

“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.

Most polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.

Former Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.

A recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.

Distain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.

Yet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.

“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.

The Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.

Northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.

“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.

The strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

She said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.

“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.

Gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.

Vice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.

Democratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.

She admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.

“Lieutenant Governor Northam has done a wonderful job of talking about Trump without mentioning Trump,” she said.

SOUNDBITE (English) PROFESSOR DAME SALLY DAVIES, ENGLAND'S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, SAYING: "Not only do we need antibiotics in daily life for bacterial infections...but actually a lot of people are prone to infections through their treatments, their cancer treatments, their transplantation. There are patients with diabetes who are more prone to infections. So we would lose the effectiveness of protecting those patients." Common operations like caesarians or hip replacements could become high risk if antibiotics stop working. Over-prescription of the drugs by doctors is blamed, as well as their use in the livestock industry. Experts say international governments aren't acting fast enough. SOUNDBITE (English) ED WHITING, DIRECTOR OF POLICY AT WELLCOME TRUST, SAYING: "We need to see tangible work to make sure that we're only using antibiotics when we really need them...and we need to think about the science of resistance as well and understanding how resistance can spread so that we can get on top of it with the right scientific answers too." Around 700,000 people die each year from drug-resistant infections such as tuberculosis and malaria. Without tough action, scientists say we're heading for a post-antibiotic age that will spell the end of modern medicine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican senator Rand Paul on Friday appeared to back the Trump administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

On Thursday, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year, with Paul casting the lone Republican vote against it. That approval paves the way for their tax-cut proposal that would add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade to pay for the cuts.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signaled optimism for passage of the cuts, saying Paul would back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.

“The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”

Paul responded with his own tweet, saying, “I’m all in for tax cuts @realDonaldTrump. The biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!”

The Kentucky Republican had said he would not vote for the budget measure unless it in kept in line with previously enacted federal budget spending caps.

Republicans are still hammering out their tax legislation after releasing an initial outline. The administration has said it would deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals.

Republicans, who also control the U.S. House of Representatives and the White House, are under pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing to make good on another key agenda item, their years-long pledge to scrap Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of Democratic former President Barack Obama.

Trump is also seeking his first major legislative victory since taking office in January amid a tumultuous tenure overshadowed by ongoing investigations into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election, as well as a series of the president’s comments that have sparked controversy.

Democrats remained united in their opposition to the budget bill and are unlikely to support the Republicans’ tax plan, arguing it would benefit the wealthy, raise taxes on some middle-class Americans and widen the federal deficit.

Still, Trump made clear his preference for a bipartisan tax bill while meeting with members of the Senate Finance Committee from both parties on Wednesday, Republican Senator John Cornyn told reporters.

The Senate’s budget must be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, a process lawmakers have said could take up to two weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because the White House has not been forthcoming with details of an ambush in Niger that left four U.S. soldiers dead.

The attack earlier this month, which U.S. officials suspect was carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African country, which has about 800 U.S. troops.

“It may require a subpoena,” McCain said when asked what steps his committee might need to take to determine what happened to the four troops.

Questioned what information the committee still needed, McCain said: “Everything.”

Asked whether the White House had been forthcoming with the information needed by the committee, he added, “of course not.”

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a Pentagon investigation is aimed at finding out what happened in Niger.

“An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll. The fact is, they need to find out what happened and why it happened,” he said during an appearance in the White House briefing room.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military’s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

Initially, the Pentagon announced that three soldiers had been killed in the ambush. The body of a fourth soldier, Sergeant La David T. Johnson, was recovered more than a day later and questions have been raised about why it took as long as it did.

“The U.S. military does not leave its troops behind and I would just ask that you not question the actions of the troops who were caught in the firefight and question whether or not they did everything they could in order to bring everyone out at once,” Mattis said before the start of a meeting with his Israeli counterpart.

McCain said he had had a good conversation with President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and hoped the White House would eventually provide the information needed by the committee.

From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles.

The mission had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for America’s elite commandos and there was no armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.

Mattis said contact was considered “unlikely” but did not provide further details.

“There’s a reason we have U.S. Army soldiers there and not the Peace Corps, because we carry guns. And so it’s a reality, it’s part of the danger that our troops face,” he said.

Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead.

U.S. officials have said French aircraft were overhead within 30 minutes.

Mattis said a contract aircraft evacuated the dead U.S. soldiers and Johnson’s body was found later by local nationals.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the soldiers were in the area to establish relations with local leaders and deemed it unlikely that they would meet resistance.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) disappointed Wall Street with sales on Friday, hurt by continuing weakness in its Gillette business, a week after it claimed to have fought off hedge-fund manager Nelson Peltz’s move to muscle onto the board.

P&G, which spent millions battling Peltz’s charges of bureaucratic and ineffective management, reported higher sales of beauty and home care products. But a third straight quarter of declines in the grooming business that sells Gillette razors and Braun epilators weakened overall growth.

Net sales in the firm’s first quarter results rose just 1 percent to $16.65 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $16.69 billion and driving shares 3.5 percent lower in afternoon trading in New York.

The stock had been up 9 percent so far this year.

“The quarter was a little bit more challenging. ..than we would have expected going in with the run up of commodity cost and the impact of the natural disasters,” P&G Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with analysts pointing to higher shipping costs in many geographies.

The world’s biggest household products maker has been losing market share to upstarts like Unilever’s (ULVR.L) Dollar Shave Club and has cut prices to try and shore up its men’s personal care business.

“Grooming was especially weak,” RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi said noting that was steeper than his own estimate of a 2 percent decline.

Moeller said price cuts that have averaged at about 12 percent, caused the weakness in the value of sales in grooming. Weakness in Brazil also had a big impact, as consumers spent less amid an ongoing recession.

Stagnant sales are one of the issues Peltz had with P&G in his contentious and very public proxy fight for a seat on the company’s 11-member board.

Preliminary voting results show he lost the fight - the biggest and most expensive in U.S. corporate history - by a hair. His New York-based Trian Fund Management have said they will contest the vote and would not concede until an independent arbiter had certified the count.

P&G said it was maintaining its full-year organic sales and adjusted profit forecast. But it also said it expects a $300 million hit from commodity costs, in part due to the hurricanes that battered the southern U.S. this year.

Net income attributable to the company rose 5 percent to $2.85 billion or $1.06 per share in the first quarter ended Sept. 30.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 1 cent.

This shiny, sparkly diamond was made inside a laboratory - but it has the same chemical makeup as its counterpart found deep inside the earth. SOUNDBITE (English) KELLY GOOD, DIRECTOR OF MARKETING PURE GROWN DIAMONDS, SAYING: "All the composition is exactly the same. It is a real diamond. What we've done is we've just taken what's happened in nature and just put it in a lab." Essentially, all diamonds are carbon. And inside a laboratory, scientists are using a method called microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition to grow the stones from a diamond seed. They do it by creating a plasma ball made of hydrogen inside a growth chamber. Methane, which is a carbon source, is added. The carbon mix rains down on the diamond seeds, layer by layer, creating a large, rough diamond that is cut and polished. The process takes about 10 to 12 weeks. Marketers tout the lab-grown diamonds as an eco-friendly, conflict-free alternative to mined diamonds. SOUNDBITE (English) KELLY GOOD, DIRECTOR OF MARKETING PURE GROWN DIAMONDS, SAYING: "Our consumer is millennials, anybody who is getting engaged are really buying the lab-grown diamonds. They also like the fact of the environmental aspect of it. That it's grown in a greenhouse. There is less soil being moved. We have a less carbon footprint." While similar in appearance, there are differences. SOUNDBITE (English) DAVID WEINSTEIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL GEMOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, NEW YORK, SAYING: "I have a crystal, a diamond and I'm looking at it and I see a peridot crystal, a green peridot crystal, I know right away, this wasn't created in a machine. So the inclusions can really be very telling as to what the origins of the material is. And that's what our gemologists look for." While lab-grown gems have been around for decades, but it's only recently that the science and technology have made it possible to grow large, gem quality stones. And according to a report by Morgan Stanley, the lab-grown diamond market could grow by about 15 percent by the year 2020.

Cette décision judiciaire, qui intervient 13 ans après les faits, a été révélée par Europe 1.

ADP et les sociétés bureau d‘études Ingerop, le groupe d‘inspection et de certification Bureau Veritas et GTM Génie civil et services, filiale de Vinci, sont renvoyés devant le tribunal correctionnel de Bobigny pour les délits d‘homicides involontaires et de blessures involontaires, selon l‘ordonnance de renvoi rédigée mardi.

Une partie de la jetée du terminal 2E s‘était brutalement effondrée, causant la mort de quatre personnes et faisant sept blessés selon les chiffres donnés à l‘époque. Le terminal avait été inauguré l‘année précédente.

Dans son ordonnance, le magistrat instructeur reproche notamment à ADP de ne pas avoir respecté un “principe de précaution accru” dans les décisions qui ont présidé à la mise en chantier d‘un “projet d‘envergure et innovant”.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North American department of North Korea’s foreign ministry, told a non-proliferation conference in Moscow Washington would “have to put up” with North Korea’s nuclear status, RIA reported.

“This is a matter of life and death for us. The current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack.”

“We will respond to fire with fire.”

Pyongyang would regard any attempts to strangle the country via U.N. Security Council sanctions as an attempt “to declare war”.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing the same conference earlier on Friday, urged world powers to get behind a joint Russian-Chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over North Korea’s weapons program.

“We are convinced that its implementation will promote the lessening of military activity and tension on the Korean peninsula and the forming in Northeastern Asia of a system of equal and indivisible security,” he said.

The plan proposes a moratorium on North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons tests, while South Korea and the United States suspend holding military exercises.

“The main task at the current stage is to prevent a military conflict which will inevitably lead to a large-scale humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,” Lavrov said. “All the sides involved should exercise restraint.”

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

"The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs," Streb said. "This is just another Lordstown downturn."

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

But now researchers are developing a system which allows workers to remotely control robots using a virtual reality space. When a user puts on a VR headset, they enter the robot's head, seeing what the robot sees and controlling its arms and hands with controllers in a virtual space. That virtual space is key, according to the researchers, because it allows a robot and human to sync up in a common space, avoiding the headaches and nausea associated with remotely controlling a robot directly due to signal delays. The researchers still have a way to go to fine tune the system but are confident that in the future blue collar workers may be able to take advantage of telecommuting in much the same way as white collar workers do today.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City police wrangled a cow on the loose in a Brooklyn park on Tuesday after the animal became a spectacle for tourists and New Yorkers alike when it was spotted roaming the streets and enjoying the park facilities.

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

The New York City Parks Department also got in on the act, tweeting: “Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” When another user responded that the animal was, in fact, a bull, the department replied, “Excuse our calf...er, gaffe.”

Los Angeles outfielder Enrique Hernandez struck three home runs, including a grand slam in the third inning, and drove in seven runs at Wrigley Field in Chicago.

Los Angeles will meet either the New York Yankees or Houston Astros in the World Series, which starts in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The Yankees lead the Astros 3-2 in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series ahead of Game Six in Houston on Friday and, if needed, Game Seven on Saturday.

The Dodgers have won the World Series five times since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958, most recently in their last trip to the ‘Fall Classic’.

”Feels good to hear (the words) ‘World Series,'“ Los Angeles starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw said. ”It’s been a long time coming for this team. I never thought in a million years I’d get to play a World Series.

“I don’t know how to compare it to years past but everybody has a role and everybody executes. It just seems like there’s a different superstar every night.”

While the Dodgers celebrated, the Cubs’ season concluded with barely a whimper, 12 months after they ended a century-long drought by beating the Cleveland Indians in the seventh game of the World Series.

The Cubs were never in it on Thursday, as the Dodgers batters jumped all over Chicago starter Jose Quintana.

The Colombian left-hander barely made it out of the second inning, replaced by Hector Rondon with nobody out and the bases loaded in the third.

Rondon quickly struck out Logan Forsythe before Hernandez sent the first pitch he faced over the ivy wall to make the score 7-0, effectively ending the contest.

Hernandez matched a major league playoff record with seven RBIs, while every position player had at least one hit for Los Angeles as they racked up 16 in all, to the Cubs’ four.

Kershaw got the win after giving up three hits and one run over six innings.

A three-times Cy Young Award winner for best pitcher in the National League, he improved his mediocre postseason record to 6-7, while the Dodger bullpen pitched three scoreless innings, extending their streak to 23 consecutive scoreless innings.

Cubs manager Joe Maddon lamented his team’s lack of offense in the series, but also complimented the Los Angeles pitching.

“Give the Dodgers credit, they pitched well, had a great plan, stuck to it, didn’t walk anybody,” he said.

Launched just last week, Hong Kong’s Gobee.bike has already spread its bikes all over Paris and Chinese giants Ofo and Mobike, as well as Singapore startup oBike, see entering the French capital as a key step in their plans to conquer Europe’s city centers.

Armed with hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, the Asian bike-sharing firms, which have revolutionized urban transport in China, have already launched their colorful dockless bikes in a string of European cities like Milan and London, some with local authority blessing, some not.

Some cities fear that the uncontrolled introduction of thousands of bicycles will bring chaos on roads and sidewalks, as has happened in China. Dockless bikes can be found and unlocked with mobile apps and parked anywhere.

Paris deputy mayor for urban planning Jean-Louis Missika, told Reuters the city wants to control the bike schemes and does not want to see them to break into an unregulated Paris market the way U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber and short-term rental firm Airbnb have in recent years.

“We will ask the government to give the city the power to regulate under the form of a license,” Missika said on the sidelines of urban mobility conference Autonomy.

He added that bike share operators will have to respect rules about using public space and may have to pay a license.

“We do not have the required regulatory framework, just like it was with Airbnb ... and Uber before legislators created a license,” Missika said.

In July, Paris made it mandatory for apartments rented through Airbnb to be registered.

Missika said Paris is in favor of bike-sharing, which it has pioneered with its dock-based Velib scheme, but added he was not too happy with the way Gobee.bike had started operations.

“They saw a gap in the regulation and they jumped in. We cannot blame them, but that does not mean we will leave it at that,” he said.

Ofo - which operates 10 million bikes in China and has launched thousands in Milan, Vienna, Valencia and London - told Reuters last week it plans to launch its bikes in Paris around year-end.

Missika said several operators have contacted the city to discuss introducing their bike schemes, including Ofo’s big Chinese competitor Mobike.

Singapore startup oBike, which has launched its bikes in London, Munich, Madrid and Zurich, already has a team in Paris.

“We hope to get bikes on the ground in Paris in the next few weeks,” oBike’s Amber Huang told Reuters. The company has also started talks with several other French cities including Avignon, Marseilles and Strasbourg.

Last month, Brussels mobility minister Pascal Smet said oBike had launched there without contacting regional authorities and said he was looking into establishing a legal framework.

“We’d be happy to work with local authorities,” Huang said.

Florian Bohnert, head of global partnerships at Shanghai-based Mobike, declined to comment on the firm’s plans for Paris and Europe but said the firm always negotiates with local governments before launch.

“Some other players tend to act first and talk later, put 500 bikes in a city, have a press announcement, then a few months later their bikes are being impounded,” he said.

Mobike operates 7 million bikes worldwide, mostly in China. In May, it raised $600 million from China’s Internet giant Tencent Holdings and several private equity firms, which will be partly used for foreign expansion.

In recent months it has launched thousands of bikes in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Japan’s Sapporo and Fukuoka, in Washington DC and in Europe it has launched in London, Manchester and Newcastle, in Milan and Florence.

ROME (Reuters) - A floor mosaic from one of Roman Emperor Caligula’s opulent private ships, which was stolen after World War Two, is on its way back to Italy from the United States where it has been recovered from a private collection.

The first century AD marble, serpentine and porphyry mosaic came from one of Caligula’s ceremonial vessels, which was found at the bottom of Lake Nemi, near Rome, in the 1930s.

The artefact, stolen from Italy’s Roman Ship Museum after the war, was seized by the New York district attorney’s office from the collection of an Italian woman living in New York following an Italian police investigation.

“The United States have today given back to Italy several archaeological treasures that came from clandestine digs or thefts in our country,” Culture Minister Dario Franceschini told a news conference in New York on Friday.

“They will all be returned to the places from where the criminals took them,” he said.

Among other Roman-era items recovered was a vase from the Puglia region dating to around 350 BC, which found its way to the New York Metropolitan Museum, and two amphorae from the 4th or 5th century BC. The vase was taken from an illegal dig in the 1980s.

The artefacts presented at the news conference also included Roman coins, books and manuscripts.

Caligula, whose real name was Gaius Julius Caesar, was emperor between AD 37 and AD 41. Historical accounts describe him as an insane, violent and sadistic man who ordered killings at a whim. Legend has it that he planned to make his horse Incitatus a consul.

Are interest rates about to rise in Japan? Is economic growth going to slow slightly? Or maybe global markets are all doomed! Who knows? Two artificial intelligence researchers in Japan say they they're developing a way to predict policy changes from its central bank by watching the split-second changes in facial expression of its chief, Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda usually has a neutral expression and announcements are made in very carefully worded, dry, language after the bank's board decides on a course of action. But the researchers found he displayed fleeting signs of "anger" and "disgust" at news conferences up to seven weeks before two major policy changes. They say it shows Kuruda sensed existing policies weren't cutting it long before the board acted. And afterwards he displayed less sadness in public appearances. Yoshiyuki Suimon says he wants to study Fed chair Janet Yellen and her European counterpart next. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) YOSHIYUKI SUIMON, NOMURA FINANCIAL & ECONOMIC RESEARCH CENTER "Although it's still very basic, we've proved that there is correlation between the governor's facial expression and the decisions being made on monetary policies. I believe we can use this method to predict his next move on future monetary policies." The pair of researchers used a program designed by Microsoft called "Emotion API." They say they're already fielding inquiries from investors.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Friday in see-saw trade, under pressure from weak U.S. demand but drawing support from a sharp decline in Iraqi crude exports due to tensions in the Kurdistan region.
Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.
Olivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.
“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year.

U.S. light crude CLc1 was 10 cents higher at $51.39. Brent crude LCOc1 was up 24 cents at $57.47 a barrel by 11:44 a.m. EST.

“We’ve continued to see signs that the market needs a steady drumbeat of positive information,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research for Tradition Energy. “This week’s DOE report where gasoline demand dropped to its lowest since March gave a little pause to that.”

Oil exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan via the Turkish port of Ceyhan were flowing at average rates of 216,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from the usual flows of around 600,000 bpd, a shipping source said.

Iraqi troops regained control of two major oilfields northwest of Kirkuk from Kurdish Peshmerga forces this week, and the oil ministry in Baghdad expects to bring the fields back on stream on Sunday.

Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.

Olivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.

Analysts said the market was on a path toward rebalancing.

“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.

U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year. C-STK-T-EIA

Part of this drawdown has been due to rising exports as a result of the steep discount of U.S. crude to Brent, which makes it attractive for American producers to export their oil. CL-LCO1=R

Crude oil for immediate use now carries a premium over forward futures, making it profitable to sell oil produced now rather than storing it for sale later.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that overseas U.S. crude oil shipments have soared from virtually zero before the government loosened export restrictions in late 2015 to around 2.6 million bpd in October.

“While outbound shipments recently approached 2 million bpd, our math suggests that physical bottlenecks are unlikely to kick in until waterborne exports approach 3.2 million bpd,” RBC Capital Markets said.

Bank of America (ABC.N) jumped 1.8 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1 percent, trailing a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and Apple’s (AAPL.O) 0.8 percent gain led the recovery in technology stocks.

Hopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.

The Senate on Thursday approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

“It clearly is a positive and has added to the sentiment,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

“Any legislative action that promotes economic growth, clearly will be additive to not only sentiment but presumably earnings.”

Third-quarter earnings season is under way and 183 S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings next week. So far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.

The S&P and the Dow were on track to post gains for the sixth straight week and the Nasdaq for the fourth straight week.

At 11:14 a.m. ET (1514 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 77.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 23,240.82, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 7.26 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,569.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 22.59 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,627.66.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.89 percent gain in the financial index .SPSY.

PayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.

General Electric (GE.N) shares slipped 3.18 percent after the industrial conglomerate reported a profit miss and slashed its earnings forecast.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) dipped 3.19 percent after the company’s sales narrowly missed estimates.

Celgene (CELG.O) slumped more than 10 percent after the company decided to abandon testing a drug to treat Crohn’s disease.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,672 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,745 issues rose and 1,006 fell.

With the fate of the Iran nuclear deal at stake, Donald Trump has until October 15 to tell Congress if he believes Tehran is complying with the seven-nation agreement. Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.

There's hardly a household in the world that doesn't have a product made by Unilever or Nestle. But the sheer size of the two food and consumer goods giants is often a challenge in a changing world. Unilever's been losing market share to smaller competitors. Third quarter sales rose 2.6 percent - well below expectations of close to 4 per cent - the amount the company's shares fell on the news. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: "Unilever has been somewhat blown off course in the quarter by hurricanes in the United States and poor weather in Europe rather than the mechanical impact of the reduction of buying in the States. I think it's more to do with the fact that their leeway and ability to be nimble, has been compromised by their size." Many had hoped an attempted $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz in February would have sparked a swift improvement. Instead Unilever's only gaining market share in half of its business - that's a 10 percent fall. Even an imminent sale could come a little late. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: "Had Unilever had sold its spread business two years ago it would have been selling at the top of the market. If it's selling its spread business in 2017 I think it's somewhat off the top of the market in terms of the demand for that type of asset." The trend for fresh, healthier products is also a challenge for the Swiss maker of packaged food. Organic sales growth for the year is expected to be 0.3 of a percent less than last year. Seasonal factors - like the timing of Chinese new Year - were blamed. But Nestle's also restructuring - something it says it will speed up as pressure from activist investor Third Point increases.

(Reuters) - The news out of South Korea is dominated by political instability, but inside the country, strong and stable relationships between academia and industry continue to drive economic growth and technological innovation. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

World number two Muguruza swatted aside the 37-year-old 7-5 6-0 in July to claim her second grand slam title and next week’s showdown will be the highlight of the White Group, which also includes Czech Karolina Pliskova and French Open holder Jelena Ostapenko.

The power-packed pool, full of aggressive players armed with big serves, will open proceedings on Sunday when Pliskova faces 2008 WTA Finals champion Williams, before Muguruza takes on Latvia’s Ostapenko at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

“Maybe I need to channel some of those memories (from 2008) to play well here... we have an amazing field, the tournament is the best it has ever been run and the excitement level is high,” Williams said at the glitzy pre-tournament gala ceremony.

World number one Simona Halep was drawn in the Red Group alongside Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina, Denmark’s Caroline Wozniacki and in-form Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia, with play in that pool starting on Monday.

Halep will also have revenge in mind when she faces Garcia for the second time in three weeks after the Frenchwoman beat her in the China Open final in Beijing, a day after the Romanian became the 25th woman to climb to the top of the WTA rankings.

The elite event offers a healthy haul of points throughout the eight days of action and remarkably, seven players in the field, all excluding Garcia, have a chance to claim the prestigious season-ending number one ranking.

The round-robin format will see the top two players from each pool advance to the semi-finals.

Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers.
With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican senator Rand Paul on Friday appeared to back the Trump administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

On Thursday, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year, with Paul casting the lone Republican vote against it. That approval paves the way for their tax-cut proposal that would add up to $1.5 trillion (£1.13 trillion) to the federal deficit over the next decade to pay for the cuts.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signalled optimism for passage of the cuts, saying Paul would back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.

“The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”

Paul responded with his own tweet, saying, “I’m all in for tax cuts @realDonaldTrump. The biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!”

The Kentucky Republican had said he would not vote for the budget measure unless it in kept in line with previously enacted federal budget spending caps.

Republicans are still hammering out their tax legislation after releasing an initial outline. The administration has said it would deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals.

Republicans, who also control the U.S. House of Representatives and the White House, are under pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing to make good on another key agenda item, their years-long pledge to scrap Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of Democratic former President Barack Obama.

Trump is also seeking his first major legislative victory since taking office in January amid a tumultuous tenure overshadowed by ongoing investigations into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election, as well as a series of the president’s comments that have sparked controversy.

Democrats remained united in their opposition to the budget bill and are unlikely to support the Republicans’ tax plan, arguing it would benefit the wealthy, raise taxes on some middle-class Americans and widen the federal deficit.

Still, Trump made clear his preference for a bipartisan tax bill while meeting with members of the Senate Finance Committee from both parties on Wednesday, Republican Senator John Cornyn told reporters.

The Senate’s budget must be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, a process lawmakers have said could take up to two weeks.

However a government spokesman saw regional elections as likely.
Direct rule from Madrid would be temporary while regional elections are held to form a new government.
Madrid on Friday stressed the move was not about taking autonomy away from Catalonia but temporarily imposing direct rule until a government was elected that would act within the law.
Socialist politician Carmen Calvo, a member of cross-party talks to establish what measures the government should take to impose direct rule on Catalonia, told TVE state television that January regional elections would form part of the package.

The Socialists, the main opposition, said on Friday they would back special measures to impose central rule on the region to thwart the secessionist-minded Catalan government and end a crisis that has unsettled the euro and hurt confidence in the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who wants opposition support to be able to present a united front in the crisis, has called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to pave the way for Madrid establishing central control in the region.

The government on Friday would not confirm whether January elections formed a part of the package, with Rajoy saying only that the measures would be announced on Saturday.

However a government spokesman saw regional elections as likely. “The logical end to this process would be new elections established within the law,” said government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo at a weekly government press conference.

It will be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that Madrid has invoked the constitution to effectively sack a regional government and call new elections.

Rajoy wants as broad a consensus as possible before taking the step, which has raised the prospect of more large-scale protests in Catalonia, where pro-independence groups have been able to bring more than one million people out onto the streets.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, a former journalist who is spearheading the secession campaign, has refused to renounce independence, citing an overwhelming vote in favor of secession at a referendum on Oct.1.

Catalan authorities said around 90 percent voted for independence though only 43 percent of voters participated. Opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE HURT

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum unconstitutional, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The prolonged standoff has caused hundreds of companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia and prompted the Spanish government to cut its economic growth forecast. The region accounts for a fifth of Spain’s economy.

Later on Friday, Moody’s was scheduled to review Spain’s sovereign rating, days after warning that political tensions between Madrid and the rebel leadership in Catalonia were credit-negative for the sovereign.

In a test of investor appetite for Spanish stocks, housebuilder Aedas (AEDAS.MC) dropped over 6 percent in its debut on the Madrid stock exchange on Friday, although it later regained losses to trade close to its listing price.

The uncertainty surrounding the future of the region has rattled the euro. On Thursday, European Union leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron offered their support for Rajoy at an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The EU says it will not act as a mediator and the crisis is for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

After Rajoy announces the direct control measures on Saturday, Spain’s upper house will have to approve them in a session which could take place on Oct. 27, a Senate spokeswoman said on Friday.

Actions could range from dismissing the Catalan parliament and government, to a softer approach of removing specific heads of department. Direct rule from Madrid would be temporary while regional elections are held to form a new government.

Madrid on Friday stressed the move was not about taking autonomy away from Catalonia but temporarily imposing direct rule until a government was elected that would act within the law.

Socialist politician Carmen Calvo, a member of cross-party talks to establish what measures the government should take to impose direct rule on Catalonia, told TVE state television that January regional elections would form part of the package.

She gave no further details apart from saying the Socialists wanted a light-touch intervention.

TOKYO (Reuters) - For decades, economists have tried to guess central bank policy direction by studying subtle changes in official language -- now, researchers are finding new clues on policy, not in the words of central banker but in their faces.

In Japan, two artificial intelligence researchers, one from Nomura Securities and the other from Microsoft, are using software to analyze split-second changes in the facial expressions of Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at his post-meeting press conferences.

Their study found that Kuroda showed fleeting signs of “anger” and “disgust” at news conferences that preceded two recent major policy changes -- the January 2016 introduction of negative interest rates and the adoption of the so-called “yield curve control” policy September last year.

The implication is that Kuroda was beginning to sense the constraints of existing policies about six or seven weeks before the central bank’s board actually decided to change them, the researchers concluded. The research was presented last weekend to a subcommittee meeting of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI).

At press briefings that took place immediately after the changes were announced, Kuroda’s face registered less “sadness”, they found.

This could become a powerful tool in predicting policy changes, said Yoshiyuki Suimon, a researcher at Nomura’s Financial & Economic Research Centre and the lead author of the study.

“We’d like to analyze (Fed chair Janet) Yellen and (ECB Gov. Mario) Draghi next,” Suimon said.

Suimon and Daichi Isami, a Microsoft researcher, had studied together at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Frontier Sciences and came up with this idea around the beginning of this year.

Working on their own time, the pair took screenshots of Kuroda’s face every half-second from video footage.

Then they analyzed those images with a program developed by Microsoft called “Emotion API” that uses a visual recognition algorithm to break down human emotions into eight categories: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, contempt, disgust and neutral.

Most of the time Kuroda’s expression was judged to be neutral. But the algorithm also detected subtle expressions of other emotions that could be interpreted in various ways.

The study appears to be the first attempt to decipher policy implications from facial expressions of a central bank chief, said Kiyoshi Izumi, professor of the University of Tokyo, who specializes in financial data mining and artificial market simulation.

“Their findings offer a fresh approach to analyzing policymakers’ inner world and minds,” said Izumi, also a member of the JSAI. “I think it’s possible to build up data on other key people globally, quantify it to predict what comes next.”

The analysis uses images that are traditionally considered subjective and not measurable as a new source of information, he said.

Suimon said he has already received inquiries from institutional investors about his research.

Their study was conducted earlier this year and did not include the BOJ’s last post-policy meeting conference in September. The next meeting takes place Oct 30-31 at which market participants expect no change to policy.

A BOJ spokesman said the bank was not in a position to comment on the study.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled Brexit talks on Friday, with European Union leaders signaling their readiness to move the negotiations forward in the coming months.

But despite a more positive tone, a weakened May now faces a delicate political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without stoking a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from the talks.

EU leaders said at a summit in Brussels that they would begin preparations to move into “phase two” of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.

Yet they also made clear that May would have to move between now and the end of the year on settling a financial bill that EU officials have estimated at around 60 billion euros.

“I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit, saying movement on the financial settlement was crucial for progress in December.

French President Emmanuel Macron was tougher, saying the two sides had not yet completed even half of the work on the financial settlement and accusing Britain of “bluffing” by using the media to suggest there could be no deal.

“A lot is in the hands of Theresa May,” he said. An EU official said it took just 90 seconds for the 27 other leaders to adopt their Brexit conclusions at the end of the meeting, underlining how united they are.

May has said she cannot provide a specific financial pledge until she knows the shape of the future relationship. The EU is insisting that the two sides agree on an exit bill, the rights of EU citizens in a post-Brexit world and Irish border issues before delving into future ties.

Asked whether she had improved an offer of about 20 billion euros, May said she had repeated commitments she made in a speech in Italy last month, when she said the bloc would not be out of pocket when it came to its budget which runs until 2020.

“What I made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contributions... is that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plans ... and that we will honor the commitments that we have made during our membership,” she told a news conference before returning to Britain.

“Now there has to be detailed work on those commitments... we are going through them line by line and we will continue to go through them line by line.”

NO MOVEMENT YET

The final text from the EU-27 read: “The European Union ... notes that, while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.”

Still, the leaders held open the hope of reaching a deal at the next regular summit in December. And in a move that could save weeks of delay, they ordered EU negotiators to start preparing for what Brussels will want in a transition period.

Uncertainty over the final shape of a Brexit deal has unsettled businesses on both sides of the Channel.

Terry Scuoler, CEO of the British manufacturers’ association (EEF), welcomed the warmer words from EU leaders, but said industry needed “more than a hint of progress”.

All the EU leaders worked hard to strike a positive tone at the summit after May used a dinner late on Thursday to appeal to the other 27 leaders to help her silence critics at home by offering a signal that the talks would move on.

Many were upbeat and May struck up an animated and friendly conversation at the beginning of the summit with Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who are both seen in Britain as hardliners in the talks.

That might be enough for May to calm immediate concerns at home after Brexit campaigners urged the British prime minister to signal her readiness to leave the EU without a deal and to rely on World Trade Organization rules.

But she faces a major dilemma as she gears up for the next EU summit in December.

“The next eight weeks will be the most challenging for ... Theresa May and the most consequential for Brexit,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group.

The chair of the summit Donald Tusk said there would need to be a more positive narrative to reach a Brexit deal in December - a sentiment echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

“We have some details but we don’t have all the details we need,” he said. “It’s not my working assumption that we’ll have no deal.”

From Nike's hijab to Kanye West clothing, 62 products in the running for London's annual Beazley Design Award - the contenders on show at the city's Design Museum from Wednesday (October 18). It's not just a showcase for the latest trends and technological innovations, but also a mirror onto a year of political upheaval and social change. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BEAZLEY DESIGNS OF THE YEAR GUEST CURATOR GLENN ADAMSON, SAYING: "Protest design is a very strong theme in the show and that's not surprising because a lot of people have felt like there are a lot of things to protest in the past year. I'm an American and so I can tell you that the sense of street action and a sense of political consciousness and conflict is higher than at any point than I have experienced before. And there are some very prominent designs in the show, for example the Pussy Hat Project that was originated by a group of artists really, not fashion designers, but that's an example really of something going viral on the internet and spreading out through the digital sphere and having tremendous visibility as a result of that." The hats started as a response to a recording of Donald Trump talking about grabbing women by the genitals, and quickly became a global phenomenon. This is a drone that can detect migrant vessels in the Mediterranean and drop life jackets. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BEAZLEY DESIGNS OF THE YEAR GUEST CURATOR GLENN ADAMSON, SAYING: "Designers think of themselves as problem solvers and in the case of the refugee crisis you have a huge problem that's affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands even millions of people. Some designers have responded in what I would say is a very symbolic way, so for example the refugee flag designed by Yara Said for a Refugee Nation, that's based on her own experience of having herself been a migrant and having a a lifejacket on, and then arriving in Europe on the shores and seeing piles of lifejackets everywhere, and so that very simple emblem came out of that personal experience." But cutting edge tech is also on show, such as ink made from air pollution and a lighting system that can be rearranged to form different letters of the alphabet.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Agentes da Polícia Federal foram às ruas nesta sexta-feira para cumprir mandados judiciais no Rio de Janeiro e em Recife relacionados a uma investigação de contratos fechados pela Odebrecht com a Petroquisa, braço petroquímico da Petrobras, com suspeita de pagamento de propina no exterior superior a 32,5 milhões de reais.

Segundo os procuradores da operação Lava Jato responsáveis pela ação, as investigações apontaram crimes de corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro em acordos da empreiteira com a Petroquímica Suape e com a Citepe, ligadas à Petroquisa, por meio de direcionamento de projetos para a Odebrecht mediante pagamento de vantagens indevidas.

Funcionários de alto escalão da Petrobras à época receberam pagamentos entre 2008 e 2014, pelo menos, totalizando o equivalente a mais de 32,5 milhões de reais somente no exterior, sendo 17,7 milhões de reais apenas para um dos investigados, segundo os investigadores.

“De acordo com as informações apuradas, as obras em questão foram direcionadas ao grupo Odebrecht. A estatal adotou modelo contratual que beneficiava a empreiteira e restringia a concorrência”, disse o MPF em comunicado sobre a nova fase da Lava Jato, acrescentando que as investigações contaram com depoimentos e documentos fornecidos por funcionários da Odebrecht nos acordos de colaboração e leniência firmados com o MPF.

Foram expedidos pela Justiça Federal de Curitiba quatro mandados de busca e apreensão, um mandado de condução coercitiva e um mandado de prisão temporária, e ainda três intimações com a imposição de outras medidas cautelares, como parte das investigações, de acordo com a Polícia Federal.

Segundo os investigadores, o pagamento de propina era efetuado pelo chamado setor de Operações Estruturadas da Odebrecht, responsável pelo pagamento das vantagens indevidas negociadas pela empreiteira em diversas frentes e descoberto pela operação Lava Jato no ano passado.

Em dezembro de 2016, a Odebrecht assinou um acordo de leniência com a Lava Jato, em que admitiu participação em práticas empresariais impróprias e aceitou pagar multa bilionária.

A operação também teve como alvo um ex-agente de banco suíço que realizava abertura e gestão de contas para então funcionários da Petrobras no banco Société Générale, onde foram movimentados milhões, disse o MPF. Parte dos recursos está bloqueada por autoridades suíças, acrescentaram os procuradores.

Além dos mandados decorrentes das novas investigações, a PF também cumpriu nesta sexta-feira mandado de prisão preventiva de Luis Carlos Moreira da Silva, já condenado pelo juiz Sergio Moro em outra ação penal da Lava Jato por ter recebido mais de 5 milhões de dólares em propina para contratação de uma empresa estrangeira para construir navios-sondas para a Petrobras.

Segundo o MPF, foi constatada a necessidade da prisão cautelar para assegurar que o ex-gerente da estatal “parasse de movimentar os recursos ocultados no exterior”, o que caracteriza a continuidade de crimes de lavagem de dinheiro e impossibilita a recuperação dos recursos.

“Com essa condenação se somam condenações de mais de 110 pessoas na Lava Jato, que já totalizam mais de 1700 anos de prisão. Então, é expressivo o montante de pena totalizado nesses três anos de operação”, disse o procurador da República Roberson Pozzobon em entrevista coletiva em Curitiba.

Procuradas, Petrobras e Odebrecht não responderam de imediato a pedidos de comentários da Reuters. Não foi possível fazer contato com representantes de Luis Carlos Moreira da Silva.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and eight others injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital, two security sources said on Friday.

The sources said authorities were following a lead to an apartment thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and policemen since last year.

The suspected militants fled after the exchange of fire there, the sources said.

Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.

An Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule.

The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including Egypt’s Christian Copts.

While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.
Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.
“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November.
When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.
But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s shares fell nearly 3 percent on Thursday on signs of weak demand for the iPhone 8 that caused analysts and investors to question the company’s staggered release strategy for its latest phones.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.

MUNICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - BMW’s (BMWG.DE) headquarters were raided by European Union officials investigating an alleged cartel among German carmakers, it said on Friday, as rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE) claimed whistleblower status in an effort to avoid fines.

EU staff had “conducted an inspection” at BMW’s Munich offices this week, the premium carmaker said in a statement, adding that it is “assisting the European Commission in its work”.

The EU’s Brussels executive said its antitrust officials had swooped unannounced on “a carmaker in Germany” on Monday Oct. 16 in the first confirmed raid related to allegations that several German automakers had engaged in an illegal cartel.

The competition watchdog said in July that it was investigating collusion among German carmakers in response to a tip-off after Der Spiegel magazine reported that Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its Audi and Porsche arms conspired to fix prices in diesel and other technologies over decades.

“The BMW Group wishes to make clear the distinction between potential violations of antitrust law on the one hand and illegal manipulation of exhaust gas treatment on the other,” the company said. “The BMW Group has not been accused of the latter.”

Brussels has yet to initiate formal antitrust proceedings against any of the carmakers.

However, the allegations have begun to spawn U.S. lawsuits, adding to strains on an industry already struggling with the reputational fallout from widespread diesel emissions-test manipulation exposed in the wake of VW’s dieselgate scandal.

Daimler said on Friday that it had “filed an application for immunity from fines with the European Commission some time ago”, effectively claiming to have blown the whistle on what Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber described as “possible antitrust agreements” with rival manufacturers.

Daimler sees no need to set aside any funds for possible antitrust fines, Uebber added.

To gain immunity, the EU’s antitrust website says, a company that participated in a cartel must be the first to inform the Commission of an undetected cartel by providing sufficient information to justify inspections.

The Commission has declined to identify the original source of the tip-off, saying this is to avoid compromising its investigation.

“Daimler is cooperating with the Commission under its leniency programme,” an EU representative said on Friday.

Volkswagen could also benefit from leniency after sharing information, according to earlier reports. Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.

VW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.

Are interest rates about to rise in Japan? Is economic growth going to slow slightly? Or maybe global markets are all doomed! Who knows? Two artificial intelligence researchers in Japan say they they're developing a way to predict policy changes from its central bank by watching the split-second changes in facial expression of its chief, Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda usually has a neutral expression and announcements are made in very carefully worded, dry, language after the bank's board decides on a course of action. But the researchers found he displayed fleeting signs of "anger" and "disgust" at news conferences up to seven weeks before two major policy changes. They say it shows Kuruda sensed existing policies weren't cutting it long before the board acted. And afterwards he displayed less sadness in public appearances. Yoshiyuki Suimon says he wants to study Fed chair Janet Yellen and her European counterpart next. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) YOSHIYUKI SUIMON, NOMURA FINANCIAL & ECONOMIC RESEARCH CENTER "Although it's still very basic, we've proved that there is correlation between the governor's facial expression and the decisions being made on monetary policies. I believe we can use this method to predict his next move on future monetary policies." The pair of researchers used a program designed by Microsoft called "Emotion API." They say they're already fielding inquiries from investors.

Intervistato da Repubblica tv, il ministro ha ricordato di aver inviato una lettera all‘Agcom per valutare se comunque un “modello più neutrale” possa corrispondere all‘interesse nazionale.

Alla domanda se sia favorevole a uno scorporo e alla quotazione della rete Telecom, il ministro ha risposto: “Sì sì, scorporata e in Borsa, non è necessario un intervento della Cdp... Che si separassero, entrassero in Borsa, così è il mercato a dare una valutazione... anche per Vivendi secondo me sarebbe meglio”.

Vivendi è il primo azionista di Telecom con circa il 24% e il governo ha deciso di esercitare la golden power, che potrebbe portare a una multa per il gruppo francese, per la mancata notifica del controllo su Tim.

“Tim è una grande azienda. Benissimo gli investitori internazionali, ma che ci trattino come una colonia se lo possono scordare”, ha concluso il ministro.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Black people in Canada’s most populous province spent longer behind bars awaiting trial than white people charged with many of the same categories of crimes in each of the past five years, according to data obtained by Reuters.

Between April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.

The data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)

Among the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.

In three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.

The data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.

Reuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.

A spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.

More than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.

Unlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.

A surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.

Current and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.

HARDER ON THE POOR

Critics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.

“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”

The data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.

Reuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.

Studies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.

This makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.

In a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.

The court did not address race in its ruling.

At least six provincial governments in Canada, including those of Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba, have said they are reviewing bail practices. An earlier Reuters investigation found inmates awaiting trial are more likely to die behind bars than their sentenced counterparts.

“Normally when we play international games, I make decisions the night before or the same day to see how the players feel.”

Aguero has scored six goals in six league appearances this season but there was no indication from Guardiola on whether the Argentine will start ahead of Gabriel Jesus, who has also found the net six times.

The manager added that club captain Vincent Kompany has not recovered from a calf injury he suffered on national duty with Belgium against Gibraltar in August.

League leaders City have netted 17 goals in their last three home matches, including one of the most ruthless attacking displays of the season when they thrashed Stoke City 7-2 last weekend.

Guardiola, however, remains wary of seventh-placed Burnley, who are unbeaten on the road and have collected eight points from a possible 12 at Everton, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.

“We have a lot of respect for what they have done. With the same people and same manager they had problems winning away last season,” he said.

“But they’ve taken points at Anfield, Tottenham and Everton. We have to try and be dynamic and quick.”

Sean Dyche’s Burnley have returned with a point from two of their last three trips to the Etihad Stadium.

Dozens of U.S. cities have submitted bids to house Amazon's second North American headquarters ahead of Thursday's deadline to submit offers. Some, like Newark, are offering billions of dollars: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. (SOUNDBITE) (English) NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, SAYING: "All of the economic incentives put together, from the city and the state, would realize $7 billion in potential credits against Amazon's state and city taxes, and still it would be an economic benefit for the state, which the Economic Development Authority estimates at over $9 billion in economic benefit to the State of New Jersey." Across the Hudson River, New York City made a proposal without any incentives. But New York state is expected to offer some, according to a spokesman for the city's economic development corporation. Across the country, California throwing in $300 million plus other extras. Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale. (SOUNDBITE) DANIELLE HALE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, REALTOR.COM (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The city that we thought could potentially benefit the most from Amazon coming in from a housing market perspective would be Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's large enough that Amazon wouldn't cause it to become a one company town. Its housing market is doing well, but has enough capacity to welcome in additional workers without being, you know, too overloaded from an inventory shortage perspective. The market is appreciating, but not on the same order of other cities that are increasing at double digits." Moody's says Austin is the most likely winner. The city has an impressive work force, low costs of doing business and a good quality of life. It's also the headquarters of the retailer Amazon bought recently, Whole Foods Market.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks climbed, along with the U.S. dollar and bond yields on Friday, as investors anticipated President Donald Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint that paves the way for tax cuts.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY - expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies - up 1.0 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

But gains were curbed by declines in healthcare .SPXHC stocks, off 0.1 percent, and General Electric (GE.N), which lost 2.10 percent after its third-quarter results and forecast cut.

“Investors need to see more than some progress, investors need to see a higher degree of certainty that there is a tradeable narrative underpinning the market,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.

“Investors are only willing to put so much capital at risk with the assumption that better days are ahead when it comes to tax reform.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.13 points, or 0.45 percent, to 23,267.17, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,570.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.74 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,630.80.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.7 percent to $1.1767.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.01 percent and was edging towards record highs.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.3899 percent, from 2.321 percent late on Thursday.

The increased risk appetite also sent gold lower. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.8 percent to $1,279.25 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.71 percent to $1,280.80 an ounce.

U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.19 percent to $51.61 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.51, up 0.49 percent on the day. Still, oil was set for a weekly loss as investors sought to book profit, despite tensions in the Middle East that have slashed supplies of crude.

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.

LIMA (Reuters) - Southern Copper Corp (SCCO.N) said on Friday that its net profit doubled to $401.8 million in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier as sales surged on higher copper prices.

The Arizona-based company, controlled by Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX), added that it expects Peru’s government to issue a construction permit for its stalled $1.4 billion Tia Maria project in the first quarter of next year.

Southern Copper suspended Tia Maria in 2015 to quell deadly protests by farmers worried about its environmental impacts.

The company has said support for the project in the southern region of Arequipa has since grown. It has called for the government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to issue the construction license for the mine, which would produce 120,000 tonnes of copper per year.

“We are working jointly with the Peruvian government to obtain the construction license ... we expect the license to be issued in the first quarter,” Southern Copper said in its earnings statement.

Peru’s energy and mines ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Southern Copper operates mines in Peru and Mexico and is one of the world’s largest copper producers. It produced 675,759 tonnes in the first nine months of 2017, down 2.1 percent from the same period last year.

An expansion at its Toquepala mine in Peru will likely wrap up in the second quarter, the company said, allowing it to add 100,000 tonnes to annual output.

Southern Copper shares were up 0.7 percent in morning trading.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) disappointed Wall Street with sales on Friday, hurt by continuing weakness in its Gillette business, a week after it claimed to have fought off hedge-fund manager Nelson Peltz’s move to muscle onto the board.

P&G, which spent millions battling Peltz’s charges of bureaucratic and ineffective management, reported higher sales of beauty and home care products. But a third straight quarter of declines in the grooming business that sells Gillette razors and Braun epilators weakened overall growth.

Net sales in the firm’s first quarter results rose just 1 percent to $16.65 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $16.69 billion and driving shares 3.5 percent lower in afternoon trading in New York.

The stock had been up 9 percent so far this year.

“The quarter was a little bit more challenging. ..than we would have expected going in with the run up of commodity cost and the impact of the natural disasters,” P&G Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with analysts pointing to higher shipping costs in many geographies.

The world’s biggest household products maker has been losing market share to upstarts like Unilever’s (ULVR.L) Dollar Shave Club and has cut prices to try and shore up its men’s personal care business.

“Grooming was especially weak,” RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi said noting that was steeper than his own estimate of a 2 percent decline.

Moeller said price cuts that have averaged at about 12 percent, caused the weakness in the value of sales in grooming. Weakness in Brazil also had a big impact, as consumers spent less amid an ongoing recession.

Stagnant sales are one of the issues Peltz had with P&G in his contentious and very public proxy fight for a seat on the company’s 11-member board.

Preliminary voting results show he lost the fight - the biggest and most expensive in U.S. corporate history - by a hair. His New York-based Trian Fund Management have said they will contest the vote and would not concede until an independent arbiter had certified the count.

P&G said it was maintaining its full-year organic sales and adjusted profit forecast. But it also said it expects a $300 million hit from commodity costs, in part due to the hurricanes that battered the southern U.S. this year.

Net income attributable to the company rose 5 percent to $2.85 billion or $1.06 per share in the first quarter ended Sept. 30.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 1 cent.

Launched just last week, Hong Kong’s Gobee.bike has already spread its bikes all over Paris and Chinese giants Ofo and Mobike, as well as Singapore startup oBike, see entering the French capital as a key step in their plans to conquer Europe’s city centers.

Armed with hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, the Asian bike-sharing firms, which have revolutionized urban transport in China, have already launched their colorful dockless bikes in a string of European cities like Milan and London, some with local authority blessing, some not.

Some cities fear that the uncontrolled introduction of thousands of bicycles will bring chaos on roads and sidewalks, as has happened in China. Dockless bikes can be found and unlocked with mobile apps and parked anywhere.

Paris deputy mayor for urban planning Jean-Louis Missika, told Reuters the city wants to control the bike schemes and does not want to see them to break into an unregulated Paris market the way U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber and short-term rental firm Airbnb have in recent years.

“We will ask the government to give the city the power to regulate under the form of a license,” Missika said on the sidelines of urban mobility conference Autonomy.

He added that bike share operators will have to respect rules about using public space and may have to pay a license.

“We do not have the required regulatory framework, just like it was with Airbnb ... and Uber before legislators created a license,” Missika said.

In July, Paris made it mandatory for apartments rented through Airbnb to be registered.

Missika said Paris is in favor of bike-sharing, which it has pioneered with its dock-based Velib scheme, but added he was not too happy with the way Gobee.bike had started operations.

“They saw a gap in the regulation and they jumped in. We cannot blame them, but that does not mean we will leave it at that,” he said.

Ofo - which operates 10 million bikes in China and has launched thousands in Milan, Vienna, Valencia and London - told Reuters last week it plans to launch its bikes in Paris around year-end.

Missika said several operators have contacted the city to discuss introducing their bike schemes, including Ofo’s big Chinese competitor Mobike.

Singapore startup oBike, which has launched its bikes in London, Munich, Madrid and Zurich, already has a team in Paris.

“We hope to get bikes on the ground in Paris in the next few weeks,” oBike’s Amber Huang told Reuters. The company has also started talks with several other French cities including Avignon, Marseilles and Strasbourg.

Last month, Brussels mobility minister Pascal Smet said oBike had launched there without contacting regional authorities and said he was looking into establishing a legal framework.

“We’d be happy to work with local authorities,” Huang said.

Florian Bohnert, head of global partnerships at Shanghai-based Mobike, declined to comment on the firm’s plans for Paris and Europe but said the firm always negotiates with local governments before launch.

“Some other players tend to act first and talk later, put 500 bikes in a city, have a press announcement, then a few months later their bikes are being impounded,” he said.

Mobike operates 7 million bikes worldwide, mostly in China. In May, it raised $600 million from China’s Internet giant Tencent Holdings and several private equity firms, which will be partly used for foreign expansion.

In recent months it has launched thousands of bikes in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Japan’s Sapporo and Fukuoka, in Washington DC and in Europe it has launched in London, Manchester and Newcastle, in Milan and Florence.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

They said that after Rocha was arrested, he helped agents locate the apartment, where they found $17 million hidden under a mattress.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people inside a Shi‘ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday night, a security official said, and a separate bombing killed at least another 20 at a mosque in the middle of the country.

The Kabul bombing is the latest in a string of violent attacks on the country’s Shi‘ite minority. The attack occurred at Imam Zaman mosque in the western Dasht-e-Barchi part of Kabul as Shi‘ite worshippers gathered for prayers.

A senior security official said the exact number of casualties was unknown but that security forces at the scene had removed at least 30 bodies.

Afghanistan’s Shi‘ite population has been heavily hit this year, with at least 84 people killed and 194 wounded in attacks on their mosques and religious ceremonies, according to a United Nations report released last week.

Among those were at least two attacks on mosques in Kabul in August and September.

A separate attack on a mosque in the central province of Ghor was also reported on Friday.

Iqbal Nezami, a spokesman for the Ghor provincial police, said at least 20 people were killed in the bombing that appeared to target a local leader.

The targeted official was a top local political and military leader of the Jamiat political party in Ghor, and was killed along with as many as 30 other worshippers, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Calling its results “horrible” and “unacceptable,” General Electric Co’s new chief executive vowed on Friday to shed more than $20 billion worth of assets and hold executives accountable for failing to deliver profits.

His comments came as GE badly missed Wall Street expectations and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares down 2.9 percent to $22.90.

GE’s good businesses are being held back by others that “drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward,” Chief Executive John Flannery said on a conference with analysts.

“We will have a simpler, more focused portfolio” in coming months, he said.

Flannery declined to say what is on the chopping block, details he is due to unveil on Nov. 13, though he voiced support for GE’s 3D-printing and digital-industrial businesses.

But analysts had clear ideas: “GE will likely sell transportation, lighting and about anything else that isn’t nailed down and very core,” analyst Scott Davis at Melius Research wrote in a note on Friday.

Investors are pushing for big change after being frustrated for more than a decade by poor returns at the 125-year-old maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment.

Even before the stock’s decline on Friday, GE produced a total return - share appreciation plus reinvested dividends - of just 0.64 percent over the last 16 years. A $1,000 investment on the day former CEO Jeff Immelt started his tenure would be worth $1,006.38 today. Immelt stepped down Aug. 1.

As proof of GE’s new approach to performance, outgoing CFO Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.

“That sense of accountability has to start with me,” he said. “We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me.”

GE’s poor financial performance in the third quarter showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE’s highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark “robust dialog,” he said and shedding some of the 18 directors was “being examined.”

GE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.

GE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.

GE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said. Industrial cash flow from operations fell mainly ”because of lower power volume, resulting in lower earnings and higher inventory.”

Profit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.

Revenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes.

The Jeddah-based Islamic Research and Training Institute said it had signed an agreement with local firm Ateon and Belgium-based SettleMint, with the first stage to focus on a technical feasibility study.

The agreement is the latest effort to combine blockchain technology to tap demand from Muslim investors, with firms from Indonesia to Canada having already received sharia-compliant certification for their products. [nL5N1FE073]

Involvement of the IDB, a multilateral development institution, could also encourage other fintech firms to incorporate Islamic finance to tap markets across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

Islamic finance follows religious principles such as a ban on gambling and outright speculation, but until now the sector has focused on traditional retail banking services.

Blockchain involves a shared electronic ledger that allows all parties to track information through a secure network, removing the need for third-party verification.

The IDB said such features would allow for instantaneous clearing and settlement of transactions and asset exchanges, while helping eliminate counterparty risk.

SHANGHAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s leaders seem to have made peace with the old economic model. More lending, roaring exports and higher property prices helped push up output by 6.8 percent in the third quarter. For all the talk of innovation, restructuring and deleveraging, the fundamentals driving the world’s second-largest economy have not changed. China still depends on investment more than consumption, manufacturing over services, and cheaper products rather than stronger brands. For better or worse, Beijing looks okay with that.

In the three months to September, China’s bureaucracy mobilised to do what it does best: produce a rosy backdrop to a big meeting. The statistical result of their efforts landed during the 19th Party Congress, the day after President Xi Jinping trotted out the usual platitudes about territorial integrity and market forces.

Those forces certainly have been cooperative. Housing investment, China’s most critical single contributor to demand, remained healthy. Combined with infrastructure spending, it propped up state-owned cement producers, steelmakers and so on. This in turn drove demand for commodities, which pushed up producer prices, benefiting all sorts of other indicators - profitability in state-owned heavy industries, for example.

The private sector isn’t complaining. Trade remains robust. Exports far outstripped imports, suggesting the government’s de-facto import substitution initiative, also known as “Made in China 2025”, is gaining traction. A rally in the yuan has deterred capital outflows without denting exports - another sign that Chinese firms are moving up the value chain.

Yet there is sparse evidence of a statistically significant move from manufacturing into services. And the country remains highly dependent on debt. It’s true the government has allowed some state-owned firms to default, and suppressed the more dangerous classes of shadow banking. But total credit creation has barely slowed, hitting $274 billion in September.

Sure, easy liquidity has stimulated sexy entrepreneurship, spawning startups that enable sharing of everything from bicycles to basketballs. But these are macroeconomic blips, and have yet to show that they can earn a return on venture capital.

It’s politically expedient to present tweaks as revolutions. There are mounting challenges as distortions endure. But China’s old model, however unbalanced, is still easier for this crew to manage than a disruptive new one.

The annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent last month from 1.4 percent in August, the highest since April and matching economists’ forecasts.

Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

The Bank of Canada, which is largely expected to hold interest rates at 1 percent next week after two back-to-back increases, has an inflation target of 2 percent.

Overall, prices were up in six of the eight major components of the consumer price index, led by a 3.8 percent annual increase in transportation costs. That was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey.

Food prices rose 1.4 percent, partly due to some of last year’s dampening effects starting to wear off. Higher shelter costs also boosted inflation, with prices up 1.4 percent.

On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has given President Jacob Zuma until Nov. 30 to make submissions before it decides whether to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president, it said on Friday.

The Supreme Court of Appeal last Friday upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate the charges against Zuma. They were set aside in April 2009 by the then-head of the NPA, paving the way for Zuma to run for president later that year.

The ruling by the appeals court amplified calls for Zuma, 75, to step down before his term as president ends in 2019.

Zuma faces persistent corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the influential Gupta family may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing.

Following last Friday’s ruling, the NPA was required to make a decision on the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the 1990s.

Zuma requested the NPA to give him a chance to make representations before deciding whether to proceed against him.

On Friday, the NPA accepted that request but said any further submissions by Zuma should be on issues not previously considered by authorities.

The NPA also asked anti-corruption officials to report on the availability of the witnesses in the case by Nov. 30.

It was unclear how long the NPA would take to decide on whether to charge Zuma after receiving his submissions. It was also unclear what would happen to the charges if the NPA decides not to proceed.

It was a hairy day and not one that I would want to repeat very quickly." On October 19, 1987, stocks plunged around the globe.

Not even the losses caused by the 2008 crisis have come close. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DARREN SINDEN, MARKET ANALYST, PEPPERSTONE, SAYING: "It was just a sea of red really, red created further red.

In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the "defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them. Confusingly, these two publics are sometimes one.

The debt collector, which had planned to appoint Crook as its chairman in preparation for the London listing, said on Friday that Andy Haste who is also chairman of British lender Wonga, would be its chairman elect.

Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Jefferies and Numis (NUM.L) are managing the float of Cabot.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China posted relatively solid economic growth in the third quarter, driven by a stronger services industry, though there were signs of weakness in real estate and construction as property cooling measures start to bite, data showed on Friday.

China’s property sector grew 3.9 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, decelerating from 6.2 percent in the second quarter and the slowest pace in nearly two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a more detailed breakdown of third-quarter GDP data issued on Thursday.

Growth in construction activity slowed from 5.4 percent in the second quarter to 4 percent, the weakest expansion since the fourth quarter of 2000, NBS data showed.

Property and construction together account for 13.3 percent of the economy, with property alone directly impacting 40 other industries.

Softening in those sectors appeared to be the main drag on otherwise fairly resilient China data on Thursday. Third-quarter growth eased only slightly to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter, as had been widely expected.

Analysts have long predicted a slowdown in the property sector and construction after city governments began rolling out a flurry of measures from late last year to cool soaring home prices and deter speculators.

Property sales dropped for the first time in more than two-and-a-half years in September and housing starts slowed sharply.

China had posted forecast-beating growth in the first half of the year, led by a sharp turnaround in the long-ailing industrial sector, which accounts for a third of the economy.

A construction boom -- fueled by the housing frenzy and government infrastructure spending -- has spurred demand and prices of building materials, and the resulting return of factory gate inflation has boosted earnings for China’s heavily indebted heavy industry.

But industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, and there is uncertainty about how “smokestack” industries will fare over the coming months as China implements drastic measures to reduce winter air pollution.

China’s steel output dropped in September from a record high the previous month as mills in the world’s top producer cut production in line with Beijing’s campaign for clearer skies, pointing to further declines as winter curbs kick in.

The services industry took up much of the slack, expanding 8 percent in the third quarter, from 7.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by a pickup in the financial sector and strong expansion in information technology and other areas.

Though “old economy” stalwarts like property and industry have led the way this year, Beijing continues to push for a more balanced economic growth model driven more by consumption and services.

Consumption industries including retail and catering and accommodation posted mostly stable growth of 7.1 percent in the third quarter.

A greener auto sector doesn't come cheap. And the cost of making cleaner diesel engine cars is beginning to squeeze carmakers. Daimler's third-quarter earnings plunged 14 percent to 3.46 billion euros Outweighing record sales of its Mercedes-Benz luxury models. The German firm spent 223 million euros last quarter to update over 3 million current and older Mercedes diesel models in Europe In a bid to curb pollution and help avoid driving bans. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, CEBR, VICKY PRYCE, SAYING: "It is a problem for the car industry which has actually done rather well generally, in terms of meeting the EU targets for reducing CO2 emissions and making their engines much more efficient. I think the manufacturers have moved really quite fast, faster than some of the targets being set. There is no doubt that it's costly for the industry." For Daimler, further bumps in the road are expected. A recall of more than a million passenger cars and SUVs to address potential unintended air bag deployments will add another 230 million euros in costs. But there was good news at Daimler Trucks, the group's second-largest unit by revenue Earnings jumped by a third thanks to a boost in North America where heavy-truck orders rose to their highest in over two years in September. And third-quarter deliveries of Mercedes luxury cars rose a record 7.9 percent, thanks to demand for its SUV models.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September as the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began to dissipate, but a persistent dearth of properties for sale continued to weigh on overall activity.

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales rose 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million units last month. August’s sales pace was unrevised.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling 1.0 percent to a rate of 5.30 million units last month. Sales were down 1.5 percent from September 2016, the first year-over-year decline since July 2016.

Harvey, which hit Texas in the last week of August, and Irma, which battered Florida in early September, had already affected sales for August. Texas and Florida make up more than 18 percent of the nation’s existing home sales.

The NAR said that Houston’s market had recovered quickly, with a 4 percent gain in September compared to a year ago. Florida’s sales were still down 22 percent compared to this time last year.

Analysts expect that sales in the hurricane-affected areas will rebound further once delays in sales fade. However, the overall housing sector has been slowing as the number of properties available has not kept up with demand.

Supply was down 6.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has declined on a year-on-year basis for more than two years.

The median house price was $245,100 in September, a 4.2 percent rise from a year ago, reflecting the shortage of homes on the market.

“As long as we have a housing shortage, this will lead to affordability issues,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.

At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.5 months a year ago. Economists view a six-month supply as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The median number of days that homes were on the market in September was 34, compared to 39 days a year ago.

Across the regions, sales increased in the West by 3.3 percent and in the Midwest by 1.6 percent. They fell 0.9 percent in the South and were unchanged in the Northeast.

The Commerce Department reported earlier this week that new U.S. single-family home sales fell to a one-year low in September, as Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South.

(Reuters) - Europe’s top tech hubs tend to radiate from massive capital cities like London, Berlin and Paris. But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

A tentative green light. EU leaders agree to make internal preparations for the second phase of Brexit talks with London. European Council President Donald Tusk confirming the news on the second day of a summit in Brussels But leaders still want a clearer commitment that Britain will settle its financial obligations. And that's where things continue to stall. May failed to break the deadlock during a dinner on Thursday night. Although she remained upbeat as she left the conference. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, THERESA MAY, SAYING: "What I've made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contribution is what I set out in my Florence speech, which is that I have said that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plan, that they would have to either pay in more or receive less as a result of the UK leaving, and that we will honour the commitments that we have made during our membership." Leaders are now expected to target December for London to improve its settlement offer. With many in the UK keen for things to progress. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, CEBR, VICKY PRYCE, SAYING: "Businesses are screaming now. I mean the interesting thing is when you read anything in the newspapers these days whether it's the right wing press or centre right of centre left press, what do you have got nice horror stories of what a no deal might mean and there's a lot of focus on that." May returns home to good news. Britain posted its smallest budget deficit for any September in the past 10 years September's figures marked the third straight month in which the public finances performed better than expected That after a week of disappointing data including a 3 per cent inflation rate And retail sales in September showing their weakest growth in four years.

LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho said he has “no idea” when record signing Paul Pogba will be fit again after the French midfielder suffered a hamstring injury in a Champions League tie against Basel early in September.
“Paul is not here, I don’t know when he comes back, when he’s available, I’ve no idea,” Mourinho told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s visit to Huddersfield Town.

LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho said he has “no idea” when record signing Paul Pogba will be fit again after the French midfielder suffered a hamstring injury in a Champions League tie against Basel early in September.

The 24-year-old, who cost 89 million pounds last year -- a world record at the time -- played only a handful of games this season before being sidelined.

“Paul is not here, I don’t know when he comes back, when he’s available, I’ve no idea,” Mourinho told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s visit to Huddersfield Town.

He hopes Zlatan Ibrahimovic will return by the end of the year, however, and had better news of Marcus Rashford, who is fit despite coming off during the midweek Champions League win over Benfica with a knee injury.

United will be looking to make history by keeping an eighth clean sheet in the opening nine league games of the season.

No other team has achieved that in the top division of English football.

Mourinho was criticised for a defensive approach in last weekend’s dull goalless draw at Liverpool. Stoke City are the only side to score, in a 2-2 draw, against Mourinho’s team in eight Premier League games.

Earlier in the season United appeared to be recapturing the adventurous style historically associated with the club.

They won 4-0 four times against lowly opposition but have since been outscored by neighbours Manchester City, who now lead them by two points at the top of the table.

The game at Huddersfield is the first meeting between the clubs since 1972 and the Yorkshire side have not won one since 20 years before that, in March 1952.

After a good start, Huddersfield have not won a Premier League game for two months, but Mourinho insisted that his team will know what to expect from a newly promoted club.

“We are silly if we don’t know what is waiting for us,” he said.

”Everybody knows the Premier League and knows what it means to play against newly promoted teams.

”Every team in the Premier League is good and thinks they can win every match against every opponent.

“The players will be buzzing and the supporters will be happy to have a big club playing in their stadium.”

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

Strong sales of SK-II skincare products in Asia made Procter & Gamble's quarterly profit look better, but it couldn't mask tepid quarterly sales. Sales overall inched up just 1 percent and missed analysts' forecasts. Cutting into that growth: a 22 percent sales drop in its grooming business despite cutting prices. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi, who believes P&G shares are overvalued, said, "Grooming was especially weak." P&G's shares dropped at the market open Friday, chipping into their nearly 9 percent gain this year. Profit rose and beat forecasts. Making the biggest contribution to the bottom line: higher sales of fabric softeners and laundry detergents like Tide and Febreze. The results come just one week after activist investor Nelson Peltz narrowly lost his bid for a board seat at P&G in a historic proxy battle. He had pushed for a re-organization, saying the company was losing market share because of what he called its "suffocating bureaucracy." Looking ahead, P&G said it's sticking to its full-year sales and profit forecasts.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Agentes da Polícia Federal foram às ruas nesta sexta-feira para cumprir mandados judiciais no Rio de Janeiro e em Recife relacionados a uma investigação de contratos fechados pela Odebrecht com a Petroquisa, braço petroquímico da Petrobras, com suspeita de pagamento de propina no exterior superior a 32,5 milhões de reais.

Segundo os procuradores da operação Lava Jato responsáveis pela ação, as investigações apontaram crimes de corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro em acordos da empreiteira com a Petroquímica Suape e com a Citepe, ligadas à Petroquisa, por meio de direcionamento de projetos para a Odebrecht mediante pagamento de vantagens indevidas.

Funcionários de alto escalão da Petrobras à época receberam pagamentos entre 2008 e 2014, pelo menos, totalizando o equivalente a mais de 32,5 milhões de reais somente no exterior, sendo 17,7 milhões de reais apenas para um dos investigados, segundo os investigadores.

“De acordo com as informações apuradas, as obras em questão foram direcionadas ao grupo Odebrecht. A estatal adotou modelo contratual que beneficiava a empreiteira e restringia a concorrência”, disse o MPF em comunicado sobre a nova fase da Lava Jato, acrescentando que as investigações contaram com depoimentos e documentos fornecidos por funcionários da Odebrecht nos acordos de colaboração e leniência firmados com o MPF.

Foram expedidos pela Justiça Federal de Curitiba quatro mandados de busca e apreensão, um mandado de condução coercitiva e um mandado de prisão temporária, e ainda três intimações com a imposição de outras medidas cautelares, como parte das investigações, de acordo com a Polícia Federal.

Segundo os investigadores, o pagamento de propina era efetuado pelo chamado setor de Operações Estruturadas da Odebrecht, responsável pelo pagamento das vantagens indevidas negociadas pela empreiteira em diversas frentes e descoberto pela operação Lava Jato no ano passado.

Em dezembro de 2016, a Odebrecht assinou um acordo de leniência com a Lava Jato, em que admitiu participação em práticas empresariais impróprias e aceitou pagar multa bilionária.

A operação também teve como alvo um ex-agente de banco suíço que realizava abertura e gestão de contas para então funcionários da Petrobras no banco Société Générale, onde foram movimentados milhões, disse o MPF. Parte dos recursos está bloqueada por autoridades suíças, acrescentaram os procuradores.

Além dos mandados decorrentes das novas investigações, a PF também cumpriu nesta sexta-feira mandado de prisão preventiva de Luis Carlos Moreira da Silva, já condenado pelo juiz Sergio Moro em outra ação penal da Lava Jato por ter recebido mais de 5 milhões de dólares em propina para contratação de uma empresa estrangeira para construir navios-sondas para a Petrobras.

Segundo o MPF, foi constatada a necessidade da prisão cautelar para assegurar que o ex-gerente da estatal “parasse de movimentar os recursos ocultados no exterior”, o que caracteriza a continuidade de crimes de lavagem de dinheiro e impossibilita a recuperação dos recursos.

“Com essa condenação se somam condenações de mais de 110 pessoas na Lava Jato, que já totalizam mais de 1700 anos de prisão. Então, é expressivo o montante de pena totalizado nesses três anos de operação”, disse o procurador da República Roberson Pozzobon em entrevista coletiva em Curitiba.

Procuradas, Petrobras e Odebrecht não responderam de imediato a pedidos de comentários da Reuters. Não foi possível fazer contato com representantes de Luis Carlos Moreira da Silva.

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing “politics of division” that he said was corroding American democracy.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama told campaign rallies in New Jersey and Virginia that voters could send a powerful message about the type of politics they want by backing Democrats in Nov. 7 elections in the two states.

“What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before, that dates back centuries,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark, New Jersey, that chanted: “Four more years.”

“Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That’s folks looking 50 years back,” Obama said. “It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century.”

At a later stop in Richmond, Virginia, Obama said modern politics increasingly did not reflect basic American values of inclusiveness and were driving people away from the process.

“We’ve got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry, to demonize people who have different ideas, to get the base all riled up because it provides a short-term tactical advantage. Sometimes that feels frustrating,” Obama said.

Many of Obama’s comments appeared to be thinly veiled swipes at Trump, whose combative style and inflammatory rhetoric have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Obama made the remarks just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took an indirect swing at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade. [L2N1MU1XD]

Obama’s appearances were aimed at driving up Democratic turnout in New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states holding elections for governor this year. Democrats hope Obama can bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

The two contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can convert the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could offer clues to the national political mood ahead of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

While he has rarely spoken out about politics in the past nine months, Obama said it was critical that supporters get their friends and families to vote.

In Newark, he said no one should assume victory just because opinion polls show Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor.

“I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said in a reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

In the political battleground of Virginia, polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the people of the majority Arab city and surrounding province would decide their own future “within the framework of a decentralized, federal, democratic Syria”.

In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa’s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the SDF pledged “to protect the frontiers of the province against all external threats”, and to hand control to a civil council from the city.

The U.S.-backed SDF, which is led by Kurdish militia fighters and also includes Arabs, captured the Syrian de-facto capital of Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate this week in a decisive defeat for the group that had ruled over millions of people from central Syria to northern Iraq.

In Syria, the fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers.

Kurdish-led authorities in other parts of the north say they want a federal system that would allow regions to rule themselves without central control by the center. They have been moving ahead with plans set it up, despite discouragement from their U.S. allies and strong opposition from both Turkey and the Syrian government in Damascus.

Turkey views the rise of Kurdish power in Syria as a threat to its national security, viewing Kurdish groups in northern Syria as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is fighting a three-decade insurgency in Turkey.

Turkey said on Friday that a huge banner of jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in central Raqqa by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces was proof that Washington had been working with terrorists.

NO PROGRESS TOWARDS PEACE

The Kurdish-led autonomy plans in Syria have advanced as diplomacy has failed to make any progress towards a political solution to the six-year-long war.

Assad, who is fast regaining territory in Syria’s most populous eastern regions with Iranian and Russian military support, has repeatedly said the state will recover all Syria.

Asked about the SDF statement, Ali Haidar, the Syrian government minister responsible for national reconciliation, said Raqqa’s future could only be discussed “as part of the final political structure of the Syrian state”.

The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, has established control over swathes of northern Syria in operations backed by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, mostly avoiding conflict with Russian-backed pro-government forces.

Spokesman Talal Silo reaffirmed the SDF’s plan to hand control of Raqqa to a civil council formed of people from the city, and to hand over internal security to a police force drawn from local recruits.

He called Raqqa’s liberation “the final chapter” of a struggle that began against Islamic State from the town of Kobani some three years ago, though the SDF is still fighting the jihadist group in Deir al-Zor province.

The United States has said it will take the lead in helping to clear rubble and restore basic services to the city.

With Islamic State’s self-declared “caliphate” crumbling in its last remaining Syrian strongholds, Assad’s Russian allies said on Thursday the fight with the jihadist group would soon be over.

President Vladimir Putin expressed hope a new peace conference could be convened, though the Kremlin said on Friday it was too early to discuss the timing or venue for the proposed “congress of the peoples of Syria”.

The Danish midfielder, who has made seven league appearances for the club this season, fell to the ground clutching his leg and was carried off on a stretcher on the hour-mark at the Liberty Stadium.

Huddersfield manager David Wagner said a scan on Monday would reveal the full extent of the 21-year-old’s injury.

“Philip Billing has a serious injury. We aren’t 100 percent sure if he needs surgery or not. The final investigations will be on Monday,” Wagner told a news conference on Friday ahead of Huddersfield’s clash with Manchester United.

Meanwhile, Benin forward Steve Mounie, who helped the team make a strong start to the season, could return to the starting line-up on Saturday after missing five games in all competitions with a heel injury.

“Mounie will be back in the squad. He trained all week without any issues,” Wagner said of the club’s record signing, who has scored twice in the league so far.

Mounie’s attack partner Collin Quaner (calf strain) will miss the United game but could return for next week’s trip to Liverpool while midfielder Kasey Palmer (hamstring) is expected back after next month’s international break.

Huddersfield, who are 12th in the table with nine points, face a tough test against second-placed United and Wagner urged the John Smith’s Stadium crowd to rally behind the team as much as possible.

”We are against one of the biggest clubs in the world and we will create one of the best football atmospheres... If we want to be a competitor then we need a great backing from the stands. All four stands really support us and lift the game.

“We will try our best and will try to make this game a real challenge for Manchester United. We have to be on our very best to get a result.”

With the euro zone economic recovery well into its fifth year, the time has come to cut stimulus. Yet, overly ambitious tightening could choke off the very growth Draghi has fostered, threatening to undo years of work.

Draghi also has to find common ground between policy hawks, who argue the ECB has spent its firepower so any further stimulus has negligible effect, and doves, who point to persistently weak inflation as evidence the bank has not met its price-stability mandate.

The compromise is likely to be a cut in bond purchases at Thursday’s policy meeting, twinned with a lengthy extension of stimulus and a commitment to keep rates low for many years to come.

Such a move would ensure that easy policy persists while also reducing the ECB’s reliance on unconventional tools and potentially paving the way to exit bond purchases.

The problem is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, unemployment remains high, wage growth is barely visible and inflation will probably not rise back to the ECB’s target before the end of the decade.

The bond purchases have depressed borrowing costs but the ECB is slowly running out of debt to buy so it either takes a step toward the exit or redraws the rules of the program, a potentially controversial move that may send the wrong signal.

A Reuters poll of economists concluded the ECB Central Bank it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to 40 billion euros from 60 billion euros in January.

It was mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.

Sources close to the ECB’s pre-meeting discussions say the a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between 25 and 40 billion euros a month.

But the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.

While this debate is still open, sources speaking to Reuters said it is more likely the bank would maintain the flexibility and even signal a willingness to increase asset buys if the outlook sours.

That, says UBS, is crucial: “We view the duration of the extension in net asset purchases as more important than the monthly size in ensuring the ECB’s ability to manage the expectations around its future policy.”

New bond purchases will add little to inflation. But they will buy the ECB some time as it waits for growth to finally translate into inflation.

In a glimmer of hope for policymakers, Germany’s largest trade union recently asked for a 6 percent wage hike for nearly 4 million workers, an ambitious move, which could lift wages across the board as many employee groups look to IG Metall to set the trend.

Euro zone inflation - currently at 1.5 percent - remains well below the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent and expectations are for it to stay that way at least until 2019.

HURRICANES

While the euro zone enjoys its growth run, the United States, the world’s biggest economy, probably suffered a major hit last quarter, mostly due to the disruptions from hurricanes.

An advance release of third quarter data at the end of the coming week is likely to show growth slowing to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent with a decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Rebuilding efforts are, however, expected to boost GDP growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2018, suggesting that the dip is temporary and will be mostly compensated for in the coming quarters.

“Damages from the hurricanes will likely total around $150 billion, with an unusually large portion of that coming from business interruption to refineries, petrochemical plants, restaurants and residential construction,” Wells Fargo said, predicting that hurricanes shaved about 0.9 percentage points off Q3 growth.

But economists added that if the weather distortions fade quickly, the U.S. Federal Reserve would remain on course to hike rates before the end of the year, given that the economy is essentially at full employment.

A compromise on a tax reform package and a growth rebound could also solidify expectations for two more hikes next year, analysts added.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Call it teething trouble with tezzies. One of the biggest so-called initial coin offerings to date, which raised some $230 million for a blockchain project called Tezos, has led to a spat between its architects and a Swiss foundation that controls the digital cash, according to a Reuters special report. Even in the world of crypto-currencies, traditional financial motivations apply.

ICOs, a hot financial trend with well over $2 billion raised this year, fall somewhere on the spectrum between crowd-funding and issuing non-voting shares. Participants contribute existing digital currencies like bitcoin and ether. Some may simply want to bankroll the project in question, but most hope to grab a slug of whatever new online coinage is on offer – in the Tezos case, “tezzies” – and to see it appreciate, as ether has done nearly 40-fold this year alone.

The creators of Tezos, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, got the fund-raising formula right. However, they set up a governance structure in which a legally independent Swiss foundation controls the digital cash raised. Now they are at loggerheads with its president, Johann Gevers, who told Reuters the couple were trying to control the foundation. They have accused him of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.”

The Breitmans stand to collect a portion of the proceeds – now in theory worth roughly double their original value – as Tezos project milestones trigger the foundation’s purchase of their company, Dynamic Ledger Solutions. Yet although it seems a sensible step in the experimental world of ICOs to incorporate checks on the use of the funds raised, the Swiss foundation may have been a method too vulnerable to human whims.

Meanwhile, China and South Korea have banned ICOs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concerns. Project details can be very sketchy and it’s not always clear what contributors are entitled to receive. Kathleen Breitman likens the Tezos fundraising to making a donation and receiving a tote bag in return, but people interviewed by Reuters seem more like investors who are expecting returns.

The backstory is intriguing. The Breitmans met at a crypto-anarchist lunch. He, the son of a French playwright and actor, went on to work at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, while she later toiled at Ray Dalio’s secretive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. An early backer was Silicon Valley doyen Tim Draper. Right now, though, an old-fashioned mantra seems to be at work: “follow the money.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks climbed, along with the U.S. dollar and bond yields on Friday, as investors anticipated President Donald Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint that paves the way for tax cuts.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY - expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies - up 1.0 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

But gains were curbed by declines in healthcare .SPXHC stocks, off 0.1 percent, and General Electric (GE.N), which lost 2.10 percent after its third-quarter results and forecast cut.

“Investors need to see more than some progress, investors need to see a higher degree of certainty that there is a tradeable narrative underpinning the market,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.

“Investors are only willing to put so much capital at risk with the assumption that better days are ahead when it comes to tax reform.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.13 points, or 0.45 percent, to 23,267.17, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,570.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.74 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,630.80.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.7 percent to $1.1767.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.01 percent and was edging towards record highs.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.3899 percent, from 2.321 percent late on Thursday.

The increased risk appetite also sent gold lower. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.8 percent to $1,279.25 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.71 percent to $1,280.80 an ounce.

U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.19 percent to $51.61 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.51, up 0.49 percent on the day. Still, oil was set for a weekly loss as investors sought to book profit, despite tensions in the Middle East that have slashed supplies of crude.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Thursday he will place his assets in a blind trust and divest all his stock in a publicly traded family business, amid opposition allegations that these holdings put him in a conflict of interest.

Questions about the assets of Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell, have dogged the minister and led some to question whether he would be forced to resign.

His plan to adopt a blind trust follow weeks of backlash over a government attempt to reform small business taxes, which have become a major stumbling block for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s two-year-old Liberal government.

Morneau said he had initially intended to put his assets in a blind trust - as Trudeau has - but had changed his mind after consultations with the ethics watchdog. He said he had “naively” believed that following the advice of the ethics commissioner was a high enough standard.

“What we’ve seen over the last week is that I need to do more. As minister of finance, in this role, it’s important to make sure people have absolute confidence,” he told a news conference, adding he has “about a million shares” in the company and would work with a trustee to divest his and his family’s holdings.

Shares of Morneau Shepell Inc fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday to C$20.63, shedding about C$21.6 million in market value.

Morneau was elected in 2015 when the left-leaning Liberals were vaulted to a surprise majority under Trudeau, becoming one of the many rookie ministers in Trudeau’s cabinet.

In a heated session of parliament after the news conference, opposition politicians said Morneau’s 2016 legislation on pension reform increased the profits of Morneau Shepell.

“The finance minister and his company, Morneau Shepell, have benefited from the minister’s actions,” said Conservative member of parliament Maxime Bernier.

Morneau said he had been pulled out of government meetings at least twice since becoming finance minister to guard against conflicts of interest between policy decisions and his company.

“I don’t know the total number of times, but I can remember at least two times being taken out of meetings because of that conflict-of-interest screen, I believe. Of course I don’t know what happened in those meetings,” he said.

Separately, Morneau said the government’s autumn fiscal update will be released on Oct. 24.

HARARE (Reuters) - A Belgian-based businessman on Friday challenged Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe’s accusation that he duped her of a $1.35 million diamond ring and asked her to provide the court with evidence to back her lawsuit.
President Robert Mugabe’s wife Grace this week sued Jamal Hamed in a Harare High Court, accusing him of failing to deliver the 100 carat jewel she said she had ordered from him for her wedding anniversary last year.
Grace, 52, who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband, said Hamed had instead provided an inferior ring worth $30,000 and when she had complained had refunded only $120,000.
Hamed’s lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said she had deposed the court papers on behalf of her client on Friday.
Full details of the account holder, the account number and a copy of the account statement are required,” Hamed said in the court application.

HARARE (Reuters) - A Belgian-based businessman on Friday challenged Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe’s accusation that he duped her of a $1.35 million diamond ring and asked her to provide the court with evidence to back her lawsuit.

President Robert Mugabe’s wife Grace this week sued Jamal Hamed in a Harare High Court, accusing him of failing to deliver the 100 carat jewel she said she had ordered from him for her wedding anniversary last year.

Grace, 52, who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband, said Hamed had instead provided an inferior ring worth $30,000 and when she had complained had refunded only $120,000.

But Hamed filed his own court application disputing the claim and demanded that Grace should supply the court with details such as a copy of the sale agreement and proof of payment before he put in his defense.

Hamed’s lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said she had deposed the court papers on behalf of her client on Friday.

In the court papers seen by Reuters, Hamed, a British national, said Grace should also provide proof that he in fact owned Zimbabwean companies the first lady wished to be sold to recover the money

“When, exactly, is it alleged the payment was done? Full dates are required. Full details of the account holder, the account number and a copy of the account statement are required,” Hamed said in the court application.

Grace’s lawyer Wilson Manase did not answer his phone when contacted for comment.

The court case has lifted a veil on the wealthy lifestyle of Mugabe and his wife, nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her reputed dedication to shopping, at a time Zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe U.S. dollar crunch and cash shortages.

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) disappointed Wall Street with sales on Friday, hurt by continuing weakness in its Gillette business, a week after it claimed to have fought off hedge-fund manager Nelson Peltz’s move to muscle onto the board.

P&G, which spent millions battling Peltz’s charges of bureaucratic and ineffective management, reported higher sales of beauty and home care products. But a third straight quarter of declines in the grooming business that sells Gillette razors and Braun epilators weakened overall growth.

Net sales in the firm’s first quarter results rose just 1 percent to $16.65 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $16.69 billion and driving shares 3.5 percent lower in afternoon trading in New York.

The stock had been up 9 percent so far this year.

“The quarter was a little bit more challenging. ..than we would have expected going in with the run up of commodity cost and the impact of the natural disasters,” P&G Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with analysts pointing to higher shipping costs in many geographies.

The world’s biggest household products maker has been losing market share to upstarts like Unilever’s (ULVR.L) Dollar Shave Club and has cut prices to try and shore up its men’s personal care business.

“Grooming was especially weak,” RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi said noting that was steeper than his own estimate of a 2 percent decline.

Moeller said price cuts that have averaged at about 12 percent, caused the weakness in the value of sales in grooming. Weakness in Brazil also had a big impact, as consumers spent less amid an ongoing recession.

Stagnant sales are one of the issues Peltz had with P&G in his contentious and very public proxy fight for a seat on the company’s 11-member board.

Preliminary voting results show he lost the fight - the biggest and most expensive in U.S. corporate history - by a hair. His New York-based Trian Fund Management have said they will contest the vote and would not concede until an independent arbiter had certified the count.

P&G said it was maintaining its full-year organic sales and adjusted profit forecast. But it also said it expects a $300 million hit from commodity costs, in part due to the hurricanes that battered the southern U.S. this year.

Net income attributable to the company rose 5 percent to $2.85 billion or $1.06 per share in the first quarter ended Sept. 30.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 1 cent.

The move came after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell this week rejected Trump’s calls to punish players who kneel for the anthem to protest racism. Trump has said the protests are unpatriotic and disrespectful of military veterans.

“The President has asked for a list of supporters who stand for the National Anthem. Add your name below to show your patriotism and support,” said the petition issued on Thursday by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a fundraising organization for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

The petition was published on the Republican National Committee website. It did not indicate how many signatures had been received.

Players kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” are protesting the killing of unarmed black men and boys by police across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the country’s criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.

Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first popularized the gesture last year, said he settled on kneeling as a form of protest because it is widely seen as a gesture of respect.

Goodell said on Wednesday after a meeting of league owners that the NFL would continue to nurture players’ efforts to fight racial disparities in the criminal justice system, believing this would make the urge to protest fade.

Trump has repeatedly expressed disdain for the protests since a rally in September. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, he called the NFL’s decision, “Too much talk, not enough action.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican senator Rand Paul on Friday appeared to back the Trump administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

On Thursday, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year, with Paul casting the lone Republican vote against it. That approval paves the way for their tax-cut proposal that would add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade to pay for the cuts.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signaled optimism for passage of the cuts, saying Paul would back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.

“The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”

Paul responded with his own tweet, saying, “I’m all in for tax cuts @realDonaldTrump. The biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!”

The Kentucky Republican had said he would not vote for the budget measure unless it in kept in line with previously enacted federal budget spending caps.

Republicans are still hammering out their tax legislation after releasing an initial outline. The administration has said it would deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals.

Republicans, who also control the U.S. House of Representatives and the White House, are under pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing to make good on another key agenda item, their years-long pledge to scrap Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of Democratic former President Barack Obama.

Trump is also seeking his first major legislative victory since taking office in January amid a tumultuous tenure overshadowed by ongoing investigations into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election, as well as a series of the president’s comments that have sparked controversy.

Democrats remained united in their opposition to the budget bill and are unlikely to support the Republicans’ tax plan, arguing it would benefit the wealthy, raise taxes on some middle-class Americans and widen the federal deficit.

Still, Trump made clear his preference for a bipartisan tax bill while meeting with members of the Senate Finance Committee from both parties on Wednesday, Republican Senator John Cornyn told reporters.

The Senate’s budget must be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, a process lawmakers have said could take up to two weeks.

“My arm is perfect, if anything its stronger than it was before because it’s (been) reinforced with a pin,” the 34-year-old told ESPNcricinfo.

“It’s 100 percent now. I’ve just got to start reminding myself how to bowl at high speeds because I haven’t done it for a year.”

Steyn is particularly excited to work under Ottis Gibson, the former fast bowler who is now South Africa’s new head coach.

“It’s the first time in my career I have had a head coach who was a bowler,” he added.

“It gets me excited because he (Gibson) is on the same wavelength as us. For the first time its also great to see that the head coach is out in the middle when the bowlers are bowling and not in the nets with the batters.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September as the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began to dissipate, but a persistent dearth of properties for sale continued to weigh on overall activity.

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales rose 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million units last month. August’s sales pace was unrevised.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling 1.0 percent to a rate of 5.30 million units last month. Sales were down 1.5 percent from September 2016, the first year-over-year decline since July 2016.

Harvey, which hit Texas in the last week of August, and Irma, which battered Florida in early September, had already affected sales for August. Texas and Florida make up more than 18 percent of the nation’s existing home sales.

The NAR said that Houston’s market had recovered quickly, with a 4 percent gain in September compared to a year ago. Florida’s sales were still down 22 percent compared to this time last year.

Analysts expect that sales in the hurricane-affected areas will rebound further once delays in sales fade. However, the overall housing sector has been slowing as the number of properties available has not kept up with demand.

Supply was down 6.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has declined on a year-on-year basis for more than two years.

The median house price was $245,100 in September, a 4.2 percent rise from a year ago, reflecting the shortage of homes on the market.

“As long as we have a housing shortage, this will lead to affordability issues,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.

At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.5 months a year ago. Economists view a six-month supply as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The median number of days that homes were on the market in September was 34, compared to 39 days a year ago.

Across the regions, sales increased in the West by 3.3 percent and in the Midwest by 1.6 percent. They fell 0.9 percent in the South and were unchanged in the Northeast.

The Commerce Department reported earlier this week that new U.S. single-family home sales fell to a one-year low in September, as Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South.

Cunliffe told BBC radio he did not see signs of sustained upward inflation pressure.

READ: MPs voice worry over Bank of England's lack of diversity

On Tuesday, one his new colleagues Dave Ramsden said he was not part of the majority of BoE rate-setters who thought that a rate hike was likely to be needed in the coming months.

Another member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Silvana Tenreyro, said on Tuesday her support for that position was “very contingent on the data”.

Cunliffe said the British economy was growing and unemployment was falling. “But we are not seeing pay pressure and for me we are not seeing sustained signs of domestic inflation pressure,” he said in an interview on BBC Radio Wales.

“The inflation we have is coming from abroad from that depreciation (of sterling after the Brexit vote).”

ANALYSIS: BoE's "unreliable boyfriend" needs to get message right

Sterling extended losses against the U.S. dollar after Cunliffe’s comments.

He said the Bank’s August forecasts were for economic growth to continue over the next three years and for pay to start to increase over the period, putting upward domestic pressure on inflation.

“If that forecast - it was our best assessment in August - came to pass, I am very clear interest rates will need to rise slowly and gradually over the period. When that process should actually start, I think, is a more open question,” he said.

Britain’s economy has slowed this year, hurt by the rise in inflation since the 2016 Brexit vote and uncertainty about the country’s future trading ties with the European Union.

Even so, the Bank said last month that most of its rate-setters expected to increase borrowing costs in the coming months, partly because Brexit would lead to higher inflation.

As of Thursday’s close in British fixed income markets, investors were pricing in a roughly 80 percent chance that a first 25 basis-point hike will come on Nov. 2, after the Bank’s next policy meeting.

Most economists polled by Reuters last month said they expected a rate hike in November, but a majority also said it would be a mistake to raise borrowing costs at this time.

George Buckley, an economist with Nomura bank, said on Thursday he had surveyed 80 of its clients. Forty-two percent said a BoE hike now would probably be a mistake, against 58 percent who thought it would not.

Right now the European Union is united on one thing above all: to get Britain to pay as big a divorce bill as possible when it exits the EU. But while money will unite leaders at this week’s European summit, it will divide them after Brexit.

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill. But once Britain leaves, the bickering over money will begin – and the push toward a stronger union could be tougher than ever to achieve.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) sank deeper into crisis on Friday as the embattled company said it had lost some customers to competitors because of widespread data falsification that had extended to its mainstream steel sheet business.

Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, which supplies the world’s top airline and automobile manufacturers, also said it had violated statutory standards set by the industry ministry, pushing the scandal beyond failure to meet specifications agreed with customers.

Until now, the 112-year-old company had said products it sold with falsified data met safety and other standards but did not meet contract specifications agreed with customers. It had also said the problem was mainly with aluminium and copper products.

Kobe Steel has an extensive role in global supply chains - the company produces engine valve springs found in half the world’s cars, according to its website.

Kobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara said the company had found a breach of industrial standards at its Hatano copper plant southwest of Tokyo, along with a new case of falsification of data at a unit that cuts and processes steel plate.

”There has been also some impact on our business as we have lost credibility,” Umehara told a news conference, citing cases that the company lost orders and customers switched to its competitors. “But we can’t quantify the impact at the moment.”

He said the Hatano plant did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards for quality management after it faked data on tensile strength and other properties of copper and copper-alloy piping.

Kobe Steel has stopped shipping about 43 percent of copper products from the plant over the problems with the statutory standards, a company spokeswoman said.

Two certification companies said on Thursday they were investigating whether the plant is in line with a global standard on quality control.

They could suspend or cancel the “ISO9001” certification of the plant if it doesn’t meet the standard, which could affect its business as many global buyers require suppliers to use the benchmark.

Kobe Steel said it also found, as the result of a whistleblower, that a plant in western Japan had been ”obstructing company’s voluntary inspection” by concealing data.

After getting a tip that workers at the Chofu plant failed to report data falsification on aluminium extrusion products, the company decided to set up a panel of outsiders, replacing an in-house panel led by the company’s president.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry believes “the data concealment by its employees has hurt the credibility of Kobe Steel’s voluntary investigation,” said Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division.

The ministry ordered the company on Friday to expedite its probes and report results as soon as possible.

Kobe Steel previously said that it found widespread falsification of data on the strength and durability of copper and aluminium products sent to customers. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.

JUSTICE PROBE

Global automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products because of the falsification, although four Japanese carmakers said on Thursday they have found no safety issues with aluminium parts supplied by Kobe Steel.

The company is now subject to a U.S. Justice Department probe while checks continue at hundreds of its clients involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. But in Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.

“We are worried about the U.S. Justice Department probe,” said a source at one of the company’s lenders. “The impact will be very big if the DOJ seeks a criminal case against Kobe and hits it with huge financial penalties.”

The company has started selling assets to raise fund, on Friday holding the first round of an auction to sell its most of a property unit, sources told Reuters on Friday, a deal that reportedly could raise over $400 million.

Kobe Steel’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out.

Kobe Steel shares fell 1.6 percent on Friday. They have fallen nearly 40 percent since it revealed the problems on Oct. 8, wiping about $1.60 billion off its market value.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold miner Acacia Mining said on Friday it would need to approve a deal struck by majority owner Barrick Gold and the Tanzanian government and that it sought further clarification on the agreement.
“Acacia continues to seek further clarification and as yet no formal proposal has been put to Acacia for consideration,” the miner said in a statement.
As a result of the March export ban, Acacia reported on Friday that its core earnings or EBITDA fell 60 percent to $50 million.
Its cash balance at the end of September was $95 million, down nearly 70 percent from a year earlier, Acacia said.
Tanzania’s largest gold miner said gold production for the quarter fell to 191,203 ounces, down 8.3 percent quarter on quarter, as it had reported on Oct. 12.

Barrick Gold on Thursday said Acacia had agreed to pay Tanzania $300 million and hand the government a 16 percent stake in three of its gold mines.

Tanzania introduced a ban on exports of unprocessed gold and copper and introduced laws that increase its ownership of mines as it believes it is not getting a fair share of its minerals.

“Acacia continues to seek further clarification and as yet no formal proposal has been put to Acacia for consideration,” the miner said in a statement.

London-listed Acacia was not directly involved in negotiations. Its shares in London edged up 2 percent in early trade.

As a result of the March export ban, Acacia reported on Friday that its core earnings or EBITDA fell 60 percent to $50 million. The company also cut spending by 33 percent.

Its cash balance at the end of September was $95 million, down nearly 70 percent from a year earlier, Acacia said.

Tanzania’s largest gold miner said gold production for the quarter fell to 191,203 ounces, down 8.3 percent quarter on quarter, as it had reported on Oct. 12.

Jefferies analysts said in a note that EBITDA came below its estimates and consensus expectations but that investors would mainly “focus on gaining more clarity following yesterday’s announcements regarding a potential solution to the Tanzanian export ban”.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Daimler lifted the outlook for its trucks division for a second time in three months on Friday while its overall profit fell on costs related to diesel-engine updates, vehicle recalls and restructuring.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) at Daimler Trucks, the group’s second-largest unit by revenue, will significantly exceed year-ago levels after jumping by a third to 614 million euros ($725 million) in the July-to-September period, the company said.

Daimler and rivals in the truck industry including Sweden’s Volvo and Volkswagen have seen rising demand this year for commercial vehicles.

In late July, Daimler said it expected EBIT at trucks operations to be flat after previously guiding for profit to fall below 2016 results.

“Truck growth is in full swing, and order books are going from strength to strength,” said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton who has an “Outperform” rating on Daimler stock.

Quarterly truck orders at Daimler surged 47 percent thanks to strong demand in North America and Asia where the German manufacturer is market leader, and increased 11 percent in Europe, according to Warburton.

Volvo’s shares hit a record high on Friday as it also raised its outlook for truck markets on both sides of the North Atlantic this year and forecast a further strong recovery in 2018.

Daimler shares were flat at 68.92 euros as of 1207 GMT.

GROUP COSTS BITE

Group operating profit at Daimler meanwhile slipped to 3.98 billion euros from 4.04 billion a year earlier, including 523 million euros in one-time costs.

Daimler spent 223 million euros last quarter to update over three million Mercedes diesel-engine models in Europe to curb pollution and help avert driving bans.

It added another 230 million euros to fund a recall of more than 1 million Mercedes models worldwide to address potential unintended air bag deployments.

Besides another 70 million euros for trucks restructuring, Daimler said it also needs to spend 100 million euros to fund a planned reorganisation of its passenger-cars and trucks units.

“If special items are excluded, Daimler delivered excellent results, with trucks and luxury cars being the main drivers,” said LBBW analyst Frank Biller who has a “Buy” recommendation on the shares.

Third-quarter sales of luxury Mercedes-Benz cars rose 7.9 percent to a record 573,026 models, powered by strong demand for sport-utility vehicles such as the GLA and GLC models and the E-Class.

That beat the 1.2 percent gain to 499,467 autos at rival BMW, which Mercedes last year eclipsed as the world’s biggest premium automaker by sales, and the 3.6 percent rise to 471,850 cars at Volkswagen’s Audi brand.

The group stuck with its guidance for a significant increase in group EBIT this year and said it expects EBIT at its finance arm to also significantly beat year-earlier levels, having previously guided for earnings to rise only slightly.

Separately, Daimler has asked the European Commission to act as principal witness in investigations of an alleged collusion among German carmakers to be exempt from potential fines, finance chief Bodo Uebber said on an earnings call.

European Union and German antitrust regulators have been investigating whether Daimler, VW, BMW, Porsche and Audi colluded to discuss prices, suppliers and standards to the detriment of foreign carmakers.

“In principle, this is about possible antitrust agreements (among German carmakers) that have been discussed in the media some time ago,” Uebber said, declining to be more specific.

Clark will meet with Canadian government officials and executives from the two manufacturers, according to a spokeswoman for the ministry for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

A deal announced earlier this week gives Airbus (AIR.PA) a controlling stake in the Canadian manufacturer’s troubled C-Series jets, which are partly made in Northern Ireland.

The tie up gives Bombardier (BBDb.TO) a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N), in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose 300 percent import duties, potentially threatening thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.

Under the deal, Airbus would take a 50.01 percent stake in the C Series and add an assembly line for the plane in Alabama, thus becoming a U.S.-made product so it can avoid anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.

The Boeing-Bombardier dispute has snowballed into a bigger multilateral trade dispute, with British Prime Minister Theresa May wading into the debate and asking U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene in order save British jobs.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, which is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four nations and remains mired in political sensitivities after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.

Clark and Northern Irish politicians had welcomed the Airbus deal and promised to work with the firms to protect the workforce in the province. Bombardier makes the C-Series CS100 and CS300 state-of-the-art carbon wings at a plant in Belfast.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Andre De Grasse is eager to return stronger from a season-ending hamstring injury that deprived him of a showdown with Usain Bolt and is now focused on breaking the Canadian 100 meters record.

The 22-year-old triple Olympic sprint medalist, who was expected to be Bolt’s main rival for his 100m crown in the Jamaican’s farewell championship in London, begins training next week for a campaign that will come with lofty expectations.

“Still trying to map out my goals,” De Grasse, who acknowledged it will be years before he seeks the title of world’s fastest man, said in an interview.

“I want to break the Canadian record but definitely there are ways and steps to do it and I haven’t thought about the whole process of the goals yet but it’s early.”

To break the Canadian 100m record of 9.84 seconds which was set by Donovan Bailey when he won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, De Grasse said he needs to focus on improving his starts.

Once he gets upright, De Grasse showcases a speedy stride that is near perfection.

But De Grasse, who has been running competitively for five years, has not perfected the complex string of movements to quickly get from the sound of a pistol into a full gallop.

“My transition phase is getting good, my finish is strong so just trying to work on that first 30 meters,” said De Grasse, who finished third at the Rio Olympics with a personal best time of 9.91.

“I did a good job at a couple meets last year on my starts so just trying to be more consistent.”

To help improve his starts, De Grasse said he will spend even more time doing resistance drills, working on block starts and weight training.

With the next world championships not taking place until 2019, De Grasse is looking forward to competing at home in August when the North American, Central American and Caribbean (NACAC) championships are held in Toronto.

It was in Toronto, after all, where the Canadian sprint sensation had his coming out party at the 2015 Pan American Games. De Grasse won the 100m gold and the 200m crown two days later in a Canadian and Pan Am record time of 19.88.

De Grasse, who will skip the world indoor championships in March and hopes to compete at the April 4-15 Commonwealth Games in Australia, does not feel running both distances is holding him back from more success.

He believes running both sprints gives him more endurance and he would not even consider dropping one in favor of the other until the last couple years of his career.

While De Grasse chases the Canadian 100m record this season he knows he has a few more years before he makes a run at Bolt’s title as the world’s fastest man.

Bolt’s last 100m final ended in shock at the worlds as the eight-times Olympic champion was beaten to gold by American Justin Gatlin.

“I don’t think I can call myself the fastest man from results at Commonwealth or NACAC,” De Grasse said. “So at the next 2019 world championships in Qatar and then in Tokyo (2020 Olympics) I am going to try and do that.”

SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - Os preços do gás de botijão e dos combustíveis pressionaram e a prévia da inflação oficial acelerou em outubro dentro do esperado, mas ainda abaixo da meta do governo e mantendo o caminho aberto para que o Banco Central continue reduzindo a taxa básica de juros.

O Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo-15 (IPCA-15) subiu 0,34 por cento em outubro, após alta de 0,11 por cento no mês anterior, informou o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) nesta sexta-feira.

No acumulado em 12 meses, o indicador avançou 2,71 por cento e voltou a acelerar após dois meses de fraqueza contínua. Em setembro, a alta acumulada foi de 2,56 por cento, a mais fraca em 18 anos.

Ainda assim, o IPCA-15 continuou abaixo da meta do governo para 2017, de 4,5 por cento pelo IPCA, com margem de 1,5 ponto percentual para mais ou para menos.

Os resultados ficaram em linha com as expectativas em pesquisa da Reuters de alta de 0,35 por cento na variação mensal e de 2,70 por cento em 12 meses, de acordo com a mediana das projeções dos analistas.[nL2N1MR0UE]

Segundo o IBGE, a principal pressão individual para o resultado de outubro do IPCA-15 foi o aumento de 5,72 por cento no preço do gás de botijão, após a Petrobras anunciar três reajustes nas distribuidoras entre setembro e outubro. Assim, os preços do grupo Habitação aceleraram a alta a 0,66 por cento, frente a 0,26 por cento em setembro.

O grupo Transportes também foi afetado pelos preços mais altos dos combustíveis, com alta de 0,60 por cento em outubro. Neste período, a gasolina subiu 1,45 por cento, ainda que desacelerando ante a taxa de 3,76 por cento de setembro.

O grupo Alimentação e Bebidas, com importante peso sobre o orçamento das famílias, reduziu o ritmo de queda no mês a 0,15 por cento, depois de deflação de 0,94 por cento em setembro.

O cenário atual de inflação dá força para os planos do BC de diminuir o ritmo de corte de juros, o que já é esperado para a reunião do Comitê de Política Monetária (Copom) da semana que vem. O BC cortou a Selic em 1 ponto percentual em setembro, a 8,25 por cento.

“Espero corte de 0,75 ponto percentual (da Selic) na semana que vem e para o fim do ano tenho Selic a 7 por cento, mas vou esperar a reunião para ver se corrijo essa projeção para baixo”, afirmou a economista da CM Capital Markets Camila Abdelmalack.

'Unacceptably high' number of Afghans flee military training in U.S.: report

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.
In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.
Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.
Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.
That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan soldiers and police brought to the United States for training go “absent without leave” at far higher rates than those of any other country, potentially imperilling efforts to assist Afghan security forces, a U.S. watchdog said on Friday.

Of the 320 foreign military trainees who left while on courses in the United States from 2005 to 2017, 152 - or more than 47 percent - were Afghans, said a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).

The State Department called that number “unacceptably high”. SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.

In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.

That’s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.

“The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,” it concluded.

Only 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.

Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.

Although Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.

In response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend.

That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away. “If a student absconds, it affects his unit,” one Afghan officer told investigators.

Between 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.

Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) fined Qualcomm last week, saying the U.S. chipmaker had abused its monopolistic position by opting against licensing some modem-related technologies to other industry players.

Qualcomm said it disagreed and would take the matter to court once the agency releases a final report in coming weeks.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees industrial policy, said it respected the agency’s position but was concerned about any impact on foreign investment.

“With regards to the investigation and judgment process... our ministry is deeply concerned,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday.

“Considering economic stability and prosperity, as well as that the economics ministry is the government authority overseeing industry, the ministry would like to see better coordination between industrial development and fair trading.”

The ministry said the agency did not appear to take into account Qualcomm’s contribution to the overall local technology industry or impact on future business opportunities, describing the U.S. firm as an “indispensable partner”.

The FTC did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) supported the FTC’s action in a statement on Oct. 12, reiterating views of some industry players that it would lead to a fairer business environment for technological innovation.

The action is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing patents related to installation and use.

In December, South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating competition law. That followed a $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.

MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government has secured opposition support for dissolving Catalonia’s parliament and holding new elections there in January in its bid to defuse the regional government’s push for independence.

The Socialists, the main opposition, said on Friday they would back special measures to impose central rule on the region to thwart the secessionist-minded Catalan government and end a crisis that has unsettled the euro and hurt confidence in the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who wants opposition support to be able to present a united front in the crisis, has called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to pave the way for Madrid establishing central control in the region.

The government on Friday would not confirm whether January elections formed a part of the package, with Rajoy saying only that the measures would be announced on Saturday.

However a government spokesman saw regional elections as likely. “The logical end to this process would be new elections established within the law,” said government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo at a weekly government press conference.

It will be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that Madrid has invoked the constitution to effectively sack a regional government and call new elections.

Rajoy wants as broad a consensus as possible before taking the step, which has raised the prospect of more large-scale protests in Catalonia, where pro-independence groups have been able to bring more than one million people out onto the streets.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, a former journalist who is spearheading the secession campaign, has refused to renounce independence, citing an overwhelming vote in favor of secession at a referendum on Oct.1.

Catalan authorities said around 90 percent voted for independence though only 43 percent of voters participated. Opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE HURT

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum unconstitutional, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The prolonged standoff has caused hundreds of companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia and prompted the Spanish government to cut its economic growth forecast. The region accounts for a fifth of Spain’s economy.

Later on Friday, Moody’s was scheduled to review Spain’s sovereign rating, days after warning that political tensions between Madrid and the rebel leadership in Catalonia were credit-negative for the sovereign.

In a test of investor appetite for Spanish stocks, housebuilder Aedas (AEDAS.MC) dropped over 6 percent in its debut on the Madrid stock exchange on Friday, although it later regained losses to trade close to its listing price.

The uncertainty surrounding the future of the region has rattled the euro. On Thursday, European Union leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron offered their support for Rajoy at an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The EU says it will not act as a mediator and the crisis is for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

After Rajoy announces the direct control measures on Saturday, Spain’s upper house will have to approve them in a session which could take place on Oct. 27, a Senate spokeswoman said on Friday.

Actions could range from dismissing the Catalan parliament and government, to a softer approach of removing specific heads of department. Direct rule from Madrid would be temporary while regional elections are held to form a new government.

Madrid on Friday stressed the move was not about taking autonomy away from Catalonia but temporarily imposing direct rule until a government was elected that would act within the law.

Socialist politician Carmen Calvo, a member of cross-party talks to establish what measures the government should take to impose direct rule on Catalonia, told TVE state television that January regional elections would form part of the package.

She gave no further details apart from saying the Socialists wanted a light-touch intervention.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - A part of southwestern Niger where four U.S. Green Berets were killed during a mission the U.S. military had considered low-risk has seen at least 46 attacks by armed groups since early last year, a U.N. agency said on Friday.

The deaths of the four U.S. soldiers and ensuing confusion over what happened during the Oct. 4 ambush have thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African nation, where about 800 U.S. troops are deployed.

Four Nigerien soldiers were also killed.

U.S. forces do not have a direct combat role in Niger and instead provide assistance to its army, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support.

Several Islamist militant groups are known to operate in the area near the border with Mali where the ambush occurred, however, and U.S. officials later said a local Islamic State affiliate was suspected of carrying it out.

Following the attack near the village of Tongotongo, the U.S. military’s Africa Command said the soldiers’ mission to meet with local leaders was considered low-risk so there was no armed air cover.

“According to non-exhaustive information gathered in the (Tahoua and Tillabery) regions, 46 attacks perpetrated by armed groups have been recorded,” a note from the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency said on Friday.

Seven districts in the Tahoua and Tillabery have been under a state of emergency since March, and the government renewed the measure for an additional three months on Sept. 18. Niger’s army launched a military operation to reestablish security in Tillabery in June.

The deadly incident has become a political football in Washington amid criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump’s handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers.

Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because he said the White House has not been forthcoming with details of the ambush.

From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles.

Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead.

French aircraft evacuated the wounded, but the body of one of the dead soldiers was recovered by Nigerien soldiers only after two days.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military’s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

Deadly wildfires are raging in the wine country region of northern California – the third straight month of infernos across the western United States and Canada. By Thursday, the California fires had killed at least 23 people and destroyed 3,500 homes or businesses. Those numbers are likely to increase once the fire is suppressed and officials can conduct more thorough searches.

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.

Promesse de campagne d‘Emmanuel Macron, ce “creuset national” serait dédié, selon le voeu du chef de l‘Etat, aux filles et garçons de 18 à 21 ans sur une période d‘un mois, soit 600.000 à 800.000 jeunes d‘une classe d‘âge.

Une mission d‘évaluation des divers dispositifs existants pour la jeunesse s‘achève sous l‘égide des services du Premier ministre avant de laisser place à une commission qui sera nommée début novembre pour formuler au printemps 2018 des propositions sur le SNU dont le flou interroge dans les rangs des armées.

Le gouvernement a d‘ores et déjà assuré que son financement ne pèserait pas sur le budget de la Défense, déjà sous tension, mais ne dit rien de son coût potentiel.

“Le chef de l‘Etat s‘est engagé à ce qu‘il y ait une ligne budgétaire bien identifiée. Il n‘y a pas de somme qui a été mise en avant”, a dit la secrétaire d‘Etat auprès de la ministre des Armées lors d‘un point de presse.

“Il n‘y a pas de programmation bien précise, de structuration. Sur le budget 2018, il n‘y a pas de somme. J‘imagine (...) qu‘il y aura une ligne dans la loi de programmation des finances 2019”, a-t-elle précisé.

Lors de la campagne présidentielle, Emmanuel Macron avait estimé que le coût annuel du SNU (logement, transport, frais d’encadrement...) oscillerait entre deux milliards et trois milliards d’euros par an “en régime de croisière”.

Dans un rapport d‘information publié en juin dernier, la commission des Affaires étrangères et de la Défense du Sénat s‘alarmait du poids de ce dispositif, “un projet de société, pas une nécessité de la Défense”, qu‘il évaluait à quelque 30 milliards d‘euros cinq ans.

“C‘EST TRÈS LOURD”

Selon les auteurs du rapport, ce coût inclurait “12 à 17 milliards d’investissement initial en infrastructures et acquisitions foncières, et 2,5 à 3 milliards par an pour l’encadrement et le fonctionnement”, avec la mobilisation de 16.000 à 18.000 encadrants.

“Fantaisiste”, a répliqué Geneviève Darrieussecq, qui entend donner la primeur au “bon sens” et veut croire que point ne sera besoin de “moyens sophistiqués”. “Si le coût budgétaire dépasse nos ambitions, il faudra retravailler le projet”, a-t-elle dit.

On va vers une expérimentation en 2019, sans doute à l‘échelle d‘une région, indique-t-on dans l‘entourage de la secrétaire d‘Etat. “C‘est très lourd en termes d‘organisation et de budget”, ajoute-t-on.

La Défense, mais aussi les ministères de l‘Education nationale, de la Santé, seront concernés.

Le SNU devra en outre s‘articuler avec le service militaire volontaire (SMV) voulu par François Hollande à la suite des attentats de janvier 2015 pour les jeunes de 18 à 25 ans. Un parcours d‘insertion vers l‘emploi de six à douze mois.

Jacques Chirac a supprimé en 1997 le service militaire obligatoire.

Outre les travaux de la commission, qui réunira représentants des ministères, parlementaires, membres des collectivités territoriales, etc., Geneviève Darrieussecq réfléchit à lancer “une grande consultation numérique” pour des appels à projets.

“Il faudra que les jeunes sortent du SNU en sachant ce qu‘est l‘engagement”, a-t-elle souligné.

Selon les pistes tracées à grand trait par la secrétaire d‘Etat, la vocation de ce service obligatoire serait d‘inculquer aux jeunes “l‘esprit de défense”, l‘esprit civique, de leur apprendre les gestes qui sauvent, “les gestes à faire et à ne pas faire” en cas de crise ou cataclysme naturel, de développer la prévention en matière numérique, mais aussi de vérifier les apprentissages basiques et l‘état de santé de conscrits.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) sank deeper into crisis on Friday as the embattled company said it had lost some customers to competitors because of widespread data falsification that had extended to its mainstream steel sheet business.

Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, which supplies the world’s top airline and automobile manufacturers, also said it had violated statutory standards set by the industry ministry, pushing the scandal beyond failure to meet specifications agreed with customers.

Until now, the 112-year-old company had said products it sold with falsified data met safety and other standards but did not meet contract specifications agreed with customers. It had also said the problem was mainly with aluminium and copper products.

Kobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara said the company had found a breach of industrial standards at its Hatano copper plant southwest of Tokyo, along with a new case of falsification of data at a unit that cuts and processes steel plate.

”There has been also some impact on our business as we have lost credibility,” Umehara told a news conference, citing cases that the company lost orders and customers switched to its competitors. “But we can’t quantify the impact at the moment.”

He said the Hatano plant did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards for quality management after it faked data on tensile strength and other properties of copper and copper-alloy piping.

Kobe Steel has stopped shipping about 43 percent of copper products from the plant over the problems with the statutory standards, a company spokeswoman said.

Two certification companies said on Thursday they were investigating whether the plant is in line with a global standard on quality control.

They could suspend or cancel the “ISO9001” certification of the plant if it doesn’t meet the standard, which could affect its business as many global buyers require suppliers to use the benchmark.

Kobe Steel said it also found, as the result of a whistleblower, that a plant in western Japan had been ”obstructing company’s voluntary inspection” by concealing data.

After getting a tip that workers at the Chofu plant failed to report data falsification on aluminium extrusion products, the company decided to set up a panel of outsiders, replacing an in-house panel led by the company’s president.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry believes “the data concealment by its employees has hurt the credibility of Kobe Steel’s voluntary investigation,” said Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division.

The ministry ordered the company on Friday to expedite its probes and report results as soon as possible.

Kobe Steel previously said that it found widespread falsification of data on the strength and durability of copper and aluminium products sent to customers. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.

JUSTICE PROBE

Global automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products because of the falsification, although four Japanese carmakers said on Thursday they have found no safety issues with aluminium parts supplied by Kobe Steel.

The company is now subject to a U.S. Justice Department probe while checks continue at hundreds of its clients involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. But in Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.

“We are worried about the U.S. Justice Department probe,” said a source at one of the company’s lenders. “The impact will be very big if the DOJ seeks a criminal case against Kobe and hits it with huge financial penalties.”

The company has started selling assets to raise fund, on Friday holding the first round of an auction to sell its most of a property unit, sources told Reuters on Friday, a deal that reportedly could raise over $400 million.

Kobe Steel’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out.

Kobe Steel shares fell 1.6 percent on Friday. They have fallen nearly 40 percent since it revealed the problems on Oct. 8, wiping about $1.60 billion off its market value.

BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces took control on Friday of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said.

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad’s wishes.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties.

The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.

The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.

The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.

Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

Iraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.

Sistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.

ACCUSATIONS

Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Iraq’s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war.

Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.

Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.

“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.

An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.

Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

Are interest rates about to rise in Japan? Is economic growth going to slow slightly? Or maybe global markets are all doomed! Who knows? Two artificial intelligence researchers in Japan say they they're developing a way to predict policy changes from its central bank by watching the split-second changes in facial expression of its chief, Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda usually has a neutral expression and announcements are made in very carefully worded, dry, language after the bank's board decides on a course of action. But the researchers found he displayed fleeting signs of "anger" and "disgust" at news conferences up to seven weeks before two major policy changes. They say it shows Kuruda sensed existing policies weren't cutting it long before the board acted. And afterwards he displayed less sadness in public appearances. Yoshiyuki Suimon says he wants to study Fed chair Janet Yellen and her European counterpart next. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) YOSHIYUKI SUIMON, NOMURA FINANCIAL & ECONOMIC RESEARCH CENTER "Although it's still very basic, we've proved that there is correlation between the governor's facial expression and the decisions being made on monetary policies.

They say they're already fielding inquiries from investors.

The annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent last month from 1.4 percent in August, the highest since April and matching economists’ forecasts.

Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

The Bank of Canada, which is largely expected to hold interest rates at 1 percent next week after two back-to-back increases, has an inflation target of 2 percent.

Overall, prices were up in six of the eight major components of the consumer price index, led by a 3.8 percent annual increase in transportation costs. That was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey.

Food prices rose 1.4 percent, partly due to some of last year’s dampening effects starting to wear off. Higher shelter costs also boosted inflation, with prices up 1.4 percent.

The Jeddah-based Islamic Research and Training Institute said it had signed an agreement with local firm Ateon and Belgium-based SettleMint, with the first stage to focus on a technical feasibility study.

The agreement is the latest effort to combine blockchain technology to tap demand from Muslim investors, with firms from Indonesia to Canada having already received sharia-compliant certification for their products. [nL5N1FE073]

Involvement of the IDB, a multilateral development institution, could also encourage other fintech firms to incorporate Islamic finance to tap markets across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

Islamic finance follows religious principles such as a ban on gambling and outright speculation, but until now the sector has focused on traditional retail banking services.

Blockchain involves a shared electronic ledger that allows all parties to track information through a secure network, removing the need for third-party verification.

The IDB said such features would allow for instantaneous clearing and settlement of transactions and asset exchanges, while helping eliminate counterparty risk.

MILANO (Reuters) - MILANO, 20 ottobre (Reuters) - Il Btp appare in calo, sebbene registri una performance migliore della controparte tedesca che invece, in scia ai titoli del Tesoro Usa, risulta penalizzata dal rafforzarsi delle attese di una riforma fiscale Usa. Come conseguenza lo spread aggiorna i minimi da settembre toccando i 160 punti base.

** “La questione della riforma fiscale di Trump ha impresso al mercato un altro tono. In termini relativi, i Btp stanno beneficiando della pressione sul Bund e in parte anche della sempre più delicata questiona catalana” dice un trader italiano. “Sembra inevitabile che ormai in Spagna si andrà allo scontro fra Madrid e Barcellona, resta da capire che effetti avrà tutto questo sull‘economia”.

** Le aspettative di uno stimolo all‘economia Usa si sono rafforzate ieri, dopo che la riforma fiscale promessa dal presidente Usa Donald Trump è apparsa più vicina con l‘approvazione in Senato di un progetto di bilancio per l‘anno fiscale 2018 che apre la strada per un taglio alle tasse senza supporto democratico.

** Il senato spagnolo potrebbe votare già alla fine della prossima settimana l‘approvazione di misure volte a imporre un governo diretto sulla catalogna da parte di Madrid. Intanto il premier spagnolo Mariano Rajoy riunirà domani il consiglio dei ministri per avviare le formalità che porteranno all‘attivazione dell‘articolo 155 della costituzione che prevede la sospensione dell‘autonomia catalana. Il governo spagnolo si è accordato con il partito socialista all‘opposizione (Psoe) per tenere elezioni in Catalogna a gennaio all‘interno di un pacchetto di misure straordinarie per imporre temporaneamente un controllo diretto sulla regione.

** Ieri il leader catalano Carles Puigdemont, ignorando l‘ultimatum dato da Madrid, ha comunicato che il parlamento regionale potrebbe votare una formale dichiarazione di indipendenza dalla Spagna se il governo centrale non dovesse accettare il dialogo con la Catalogna.

** Attorno alle 11,45 lo spread Italia-Spagna si attesta a 41 punti base, da una chiusura ieri a 40 punti base, mentre il future sul Bono decennale cede 17 tick 137,50.

** Il Tesoro ha annunciato ieri il lancio del nuovo Btp Italia, il secondo del 2017, con scadenza 6 anni come l‘emissione dello scorso aprile. Il comunicato di via XX settembre informa che l‘offerta, in due fasi, si terrà tra il 13 e il 16 novembre.

Peking (Reuters) - Öffnung für ausländische Investoren, Abbau von Kreditrisiken, Umbau der Industrie: China will mit einer Reihe von Reformen das Wachstum seiner Wirtschaft sichern. Diese zeigt sich derzeit in guter Form. Trotz einer minimalen Abkühlung in den Sommermonaten dürfte sich der Aufschwung in der nach den USA zweitgrößten Volkswirtschaft der Welt 2017 verstärken - zum ersten Mal seit sieben Jahren.

“Wir werden ausländischen Banken mehr Raum geben”, kündigte der Chef der Bankenaufsicht Guo Shuqing, auf dem Parteinkongress an. Der Marktanteil ausländischer Banken in der Volksrepublik habe sich in den vergangenen zehn Jahren auf 1,2 Prozent halbiert. “Das ist kein Vorteil für den Wettbewerb und Strukturverbesserungen”, sagte Guo. Er signalisierte zudem, die Regeln für den Abbau fauler Kredite zu verschärfen. Finanzrisiken müssten ebenso eingedämmt werden wie ein Anstieg versteckter Schulden. Die Verschuldung, die etwa 258 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes ausmacht, gilt als eines der größten Konjunkturrisiken. Die Rating-Agentur S&P stufte erst im September die Kreditwürdigkeit des Landes herab, da “eine längere Phase des starken Kreditwachstums die ökonomischen und finanziellen Risiken Chinas erhöht hat”.

Die Zentralbank ist sich des Problems bewusst. Ihr Chef Zhou Xiaochuan warnte am Rande des Kongresses vor einem “Minsky Moment”. Er spielte damit auf eine nach dem amerikanischen Ökonom Hyman Minsky benannte Theorie an, wonach trotz boomender Wirtschaft eine plötzliche Krise auftreten kann. “Wir sollten uns darauf konzentrieren, dramatischen Anpassungen vorzubeugen”, sagte Zhou mit Blick auf die hohe Verschuldung der Unternehmen und steigender Verbraucherkredite.

Die Regierung geht bereits gegen eine drohende Immobilienpreisblase vor, was derzeit den Aufschwung leicht dämpft. Das Bruttoinlandsprodukt stieg im dritten Quartal um 6,8 Prozent zum Vorjahreszeitraum. Im ersten Halbjahr hatte es noch zu 6,9 Prozent gereicht. Trotz des etwas verlangsamten Tempos dürfte das von der Regierung vorgegebene Ziel von rund 6,5 Prozent für das Gesamtjahr übertroffen werden. Die Konjunktur sei stabil, sagte der Sprecher des Statistikamtes Xing Zhihong. 2016 hatte es mit 6,7 Prozent das kleinste Plus seit 26 Jahren gegeben. Dieser Wert dürfte in diesem Jahr übertroffen werden, erwarten Experten nach den ersten drei Quartalen.

Bremsspuren hinterließ in den Sommermonaten der Bausektor. Die Zahl der Neubauten nahm nicht mehr so stark zu, während der Verkauf von Bestandsimmobilien im September sogar erstmals seit mehr als zweieinhalb Jahren sank. “Der Immobilienboom hat zweifellos seinen Höhepunkt überschritten”, sagte Analystin Rosealea Yao vom Beratungsunternehmen Gavekal Dragonomics. Um Überhitzungen vorzubeugen, hat die Regierung beispielsweise die Vergabe risikoreicher Kredite erschwert.

Gestützt wird der Aufschwung vom Außenhandel und der Industrie, die von der besseren Weltkonjunktur profitiert. Die Firmen stellten im September 6,6 Prozent mehr her als vor Jahresfrist. Das ist mehr als Experten für möglich gehalten hatten. Sie bereiten sich damit auch auf den Winter vor, in dem die Regierung immer wieder im Kampf gegen die Luftverschmutzung Fabriken stilllegt. Der Einzelhandel schaffte im September ein überraschend kräftiges Umsatzplus von 10,3 Prozent.

“Derzeit braucht man sich um das chinesische Wachstum nicht zu sorgen”, sagte der Chefvolkswirt der VP Bank, Thomas Gitzel. “Auch in den kommenden Quartalen dürfte die Volkswirtschaft in ähnlicher Größenordnung zulegen, dafür wird alleine schon die Regierung sorgen.” Präsident Xi Jinping kündigte auf dem Parteikongress eine Öffnung des Dienstleistungssektors sowie eine Reform des Devisen- und Finanzsystems an. Bis 2035 solle China eines der innovativsten Länder der Welt werden, das seine Umweltprobleme grundlegend gelöst habe. In der Binnenwirtschaft will Xi den privaten Konsum als Grundlage für die weitere Entwicklung ankurbeln. Fortgesetzt werde der Kampf gegen Überkapazitäten in der Industrie.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Jacob Zuma’s spokesman said on Friday there was no basis for reports that the South African president would axe his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, speculation about which has weighed on the currency and bonds.

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, of which Zuma is leader and Ramaphosa deputy, has been riven by bitter infighting ahead of a party conference in December at which a new leader will be chosen.

“It’s rumors and gossip, and we don’t comment on them at all,” Zuma’s spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga told Reuters.

Ramaphosa, a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon, is viewed as the most likely rival candidate to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the former chairwoman of the African Union, who is Zuma’s pick for the leadership and is the president’s ex-wife.

He has recently stepped up criticism of Zuma’s scandal-plagued government.

Asked in parliament on Thursday whether he might be sacked, Ramaphosa said only that he would accept the president’s decision if he lost his job. On Friday, a spokesman for the deputy president said: “We are aware of the speculation, but it is just speculation.”

Trade union federation Cosatu and the South African Communist Party (SACP), both partners in the ANC’s ruling alliance, have endorsed Ramaphosa, 64, for the leadership.

South Africa will elect a new president in 2019, and whoever the ANC picks in December is likely to take over from 75-year-old Zuma as the country’s leader.

Zuma is under pressure to step down before then, with a recent South African court ruling that nearly 800 corruption charges against him should be reinstated prompting more calls for the president to go.

Zuma reshuffled his cabinet for the second time in seven months on Tuesday, irking some within the ruling alliance by sacking a minister belonging to the SACP and appointing a close ally to oversee an opaque nuclear deal.

Analysts say Zuma may make further changes before December to strengthen his hand going into the ANC’s elective conference.

Speculation that he might remove Ramaphosa, who was the ANC’s chief negotiator during the 1990s transition from apartheid, weighed on the rand and bonds, which underperformed emerging market peers on Friday versus a firmer dollar.

“Other emerging markets are weaker but not as much as the rand. That’s because of lingering political uncertainty, especially these rumors about Zuma axing Ramaphosa,” said currency dealer at TreasuryOne Wichard Cilliers.

Ramaphosa told parliament on Thursday that “if (Zuma‘s) decision is to remove me, I will accept that as a decision that will be taken by the president and I will continue serving the people of South Africa in one form, shape or another”.

STATE CAPTURE

Speaking on Friday, Ramaphosa returned to the subject of corruption within the government and state-owned companies, which is expected to be a main theme of his leadership campaign.

“Our state has been captured by people who ... want to milk the state, who want to rob our country of the money that belongs to the people,” Ramaphosa told members of the National Education Health & Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in Cape Town.

“Our state is now being talked about in the rest of the world in the most negative terms, captured by certain interests, by certain families, by certain individuals.”

Wealthy friends of Zuma, the Guptas, have been accused by ANC and opposition politicians of using their close relationship with the president and his allies to influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing and the Indian-born South African businessmen and their companies have not been charged with any crime in South Africa.

Regulators in the United States and Britain are looking into links between the Gupta family, the South African government, and banks they may have used to move money as a corruption investigation escalates.

In a statement on Friday, Dlamini-Zuma denied she had any links to the Gupta family.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era.
“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said.
The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent.
On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
BERLIN (Reuters) - The image of the United States has deteriorated sharply across the globe under President Donald Trump and an overwhelming majority of people in other countries have no confidence in his ability to lead, a survey from the Pew Research Center showed.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general. And in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks climbed, along with the U.S. dollar and bond yields on Friday, as investors anticipated President Donald Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint that paves the way for tax cuts.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY - expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies - up 1.0 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

But gains were curbed by declines in healthcare .SPXHC stocks, off 0.1 percent, and General Electric (GE.N), which lost 2.10 percent after its third-quarter results and forecast cut.

“Investors need to see more than some progress, investors need to see a higher degree of certainty that there is a tradeable narrative underpinning the market,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.

“Investors are only willing to put so much capital at risk with the assumption that better days are ahead when it comes to tax reform.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.13 points, or 0.45 percent, to 23,267.17, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,570.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.74 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,630.80.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.7 percent to $1.1767.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.01 percent and was edging towards record highs.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.3899 percent, from 2.321 percent late on Thursday.

The increased risk appetite also sent gold lower. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.8 percent to $1,279.25 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.71 percent to $1,280.80 an ounce.

U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.19 percent to $51.61 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.51, up 0.49 percent on the day. Still, oil was set for a weekly loss as investors sought to book profit, despite tensions in the Middle East that have slashed supplies of crude.

Chen recorded a season-best performance of 100.54 points at the first of six events to qualify for the Grand Prix Final in Japan in December, which comes barely two months before the start of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

He had two shaky landings on his quad flip and triple axel jumps. He made up for it, however, with a spectacular combination of the quad lutz and triple toe loop.

“In terms of the program, I‘m happy with the scores that I got,” Chen told a news conference. “I‘m going to have a lot of work going into the Games. But as of now I‘m happy with what I did and just have to keep my mind straight and keep working hard.”

Hanyu, the defending Olympic champion, made a difficult landing on the quad loop jump at the start of his program before falling on his triple toe loop, earning him 94.85 points.

“I feel really close to success,” Hanyu said. “I will just fix those things for tomorrow. I will recover. I will do better tomorrow.”

Dmitry Aliev of Russia, who was taking part in his first senior grand prix, finished third with 88.77 points.

Kazakhstan’s Denis Ten, who won bronze at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, finished 10th with 69.00 points after a disappointing performance that saw him stumble on his quad salchow and fall on his triple toe loop.

Ten suffered an ankle injury earlier this year and underwent extensive rehabilitation, setting him back in his preparations for the Games next year.

Ryan said the budget vote will allow Republicans to 'get on track' to pass tax reform.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday, on track for its biggest daily gain in more than two weeks, as progress on U.S. tax reforms raised prospects of a fiscal lift to the economy, bolstering investor appetite for risk.

The dollar rose to a three-month high against the Japanese yen, at 113.46 yen, and a five-month high against the Swiss franc, touching 0.9846 franc. Traders seek the yen and Swiss franc in times of uncertainty and fear and sell the currencies when they favor riskier assets.

“This is clearly a picture of somewhat of a risk-on rotation today, and it’s ignited some of the animal spirits as we take another step closer to the potential for tax reform coming to fruition,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.

“Because from the standpoint of what has the potential to impact economic trajectory and capital markets trajectory, it really is tax reform.”

Senate approval of a budget blueprint on Thursday for the 2018 fiscal year cleared a critical hurdle for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.

Investors have also viewed as bullish for the dollar remarks this week from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve that suggest the central bank is moving forward with another rate hike this year.

Price pressures remain subdued in the United States despite tight labor markets with core PCE inflation, one of the Fed’s favorite measures, at a one-year low of 1.3 percent in August.

Analysts do not expect a rebound in price pressures, with strategists from CLSA Research saying inflation has probably peaked in this cycle.

Ahead of national elections in Japan on Sunday, surveys suggest Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition is on track roughly to match the two-thirds “super majority” it held in parliament’s lower house before the snap vote was called.

The New Zealand dollar NZD= sank to a five-month low on concerns the new Labour coalition will take a harder stance on immigration and foreign investment than the outgoing center-right government.

The U.S. dollar's rebound dragged the euro EUR=EBS down half a percent to $1.1784 before a European Central Bank meeting next week, where policymakers are seen cutting bond purchases but voting for an extension in stimulus.

Enhanced risk appetite also helped boost the euro to its highest against the Swiss franc EURCHF= since January 2015, when the Swiss National Bank scrapped its peg with the euro.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY - expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies - up 1.0 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

But gains were curbed by declines in healthcare .SPXHC stocks, off 0.1 percent, and General Electric (GE.N), which lost 2.10 percent after its third-quarter results and forecast cut.

“Investors need to see more than some progress, investors need to see a higher degree of certainty that there is a tradeable narrative underpinning the market,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.

“Investors are only willing to put so much capital at risk with the assumption that better days are ahead when it comes to tax reform.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.13 points, or 0.45 percent, to 23,267.17, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,570.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.74 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,630.80.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.7 percent to $1.1767.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.01 percent and was edging towards record highs.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.3899 percent, from 2.321 percent late on Thursday.

The increased risk appetite also sent gold lower. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.8 percent to $1,279.25 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.71 percent to $1,280.80 an ounce.

U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.19 percent to $51.61 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.51, up 0.49 percent on the day. Still, oil was set for a weekly loss as investors sought to book profit, despite tensions in the Middle East that have slashed supplies of crude.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Senior militant commander Asad Afridi has emerged as the favorite to become the new leader of a deadly Pakistani Taliban faction, militant sources said on Friday, days after a U.S. drone strike killed the group’s chief.

Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, has killed hundreds of people in bomb attacks and is considered one of the most dangerous militant groups in the nuclear-armed South Asian nation.

The killing of JuA chief Omar Khalid Khorasani was a major boost for Pakistan’s anti-militancy campaign and is likely to help ease tension with uneasy ally the United States days ahead of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Two JuA commanders told Reuters Afridi was nominated to take over during a meeting in Afghanistan by the group’s shura, or leadership council.

“Asad Afridi was close to Omar Khalid, who had declared him his deputy,” said one JuA commander.

A second JuA militant, who is a member of the shura, confirmed Afridi was nominated as the new chief.

Khorasani was seen as ruling the group with an iron fist.

“Our organization used to be a one-man show. All powers were in the hands of Omar Khalid Khorasani,” the second commander said.

Khorasani was killed during a series of U.S. drone attacks this week in which at least 30 people were killed on the Afghan side of the border.

His killing follows a slight thaw in relations between Islamabad and Washington, seemingly sparked by the Pakistan army last week freeing a U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children after five years in captivity. The family was held by the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban-allied militant group.

Warmer words from Washington have been in stark contrast to threats by U.S. officials that it would cut military aid and impose targeted sanctions if Pakistan did not stop providing a safe havens to the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network.

Pakistan denies offering sanctuary to Afghan Taliban fighters and has asked the United States to target Pakistani Taliban militants who cross the porous border and hide in Afghanistan.

Pakistan is investing more than $500 million to fence the 2,500-km frontier.

HISTORY OF FIGHTING U.S. TROOPS

But in a sign that relations between the United States and Pakistan are still difficult, the chief of the CIA said on Thursday the U.S.-Canadian couple had been held inside Pakistan for five years, contradicting Pakistan’s assertion they were held in Afghanistan.

It is not clear if Afridi would change tack if he were to be confirmed as JuA leader, but there are concerns within the group about his power base among the ethnic Pashtun tribes who live along the Afghan border.

Afridi is from the Zakha Khel area of Pakistan’s Khyber region but Khorasani, and most JuA fighters, are from the Mohmand region to the north.

“The organization was basically formed in Mohmand and the majority of the fighters and commanders are from Mohmand therefore people would have wished someone from the same area,” said the first JuA commander.

He said Afridi did not have a religious or formal school education but had a history of fighting and had at one point fought U.S. troops in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban.

On Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed 12 people in Afghanistan’s Paktia province, according to a government official. It was the fourth day this week that drone strikes were reported on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.

“Twelve dead bodies have been pulled out of the area where the missiles struck,” Laik Khan, an Afghan government official, told Reuters.

The JuA has emerged as the most deadly Pakistani Taliban faction over the past two years. At one point, it allied itself with Islamic State before apparently re-joining the Pakistani Taliban.

The group bombed an Easter Sunday gathering at a park in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore last year, killing at least 70 people. In August 2016, it bombed a hospital in Quetta targeting the city’s most prominent lawyers, killing 74 people.

In June this year, JuA targeted the provincial police chief of the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing 13 people. The attack was also claimed by Islamic State.

The talks between Merkel’s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens are styled as “exploratory”, but negotiators aim to get down to details of tax and budget policy in their first full meeting together.

The tricky three-way pact, dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition because the three parties’ colors - black, yellow and green - match those of the Jamaican flag, is untried at national level.

Merkel, weakened by a surging far-right in last month’s national election, needs to make the awkward alliance fly as her previous “grand coalition” partners - the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - say they want to rebuild in opposition after their worst election result in more than half a century.

“There will be many differences,” she said on her arrival at the Berlin talks, adding: “There is readiness on my side to think about this creatively.”

The outcome of the talks is keenly awaited both at home and across Europe, with many fretting that on crucial issues like euro zone governance reform the bloc is rudderless as its longest-serving leader forges a new alliance.

The chancellor told reporters after a two-day EU summit in Brussels that big decisions on the future of the euro zone would have to wait for the formation of the new government in Berlin.

Merkel has been able to steer Europe through its euro zone and refugee crises in part due to her dominance at home. Now that dominance is waning - her conservatives last month had their weakest election showing since 1949.

An Infratest Dimap poll for ARD showed 83 percent of Germans wanted the parties to find a compromise deal.

“CENTRIFUGAL FORCES”

“The chancellor knows that she must lead ‘Jamaica’ to success. Otherwise the centrifugal forces in the CDU will become uncontrollable,” business daily Handelsblatt wrote in an editorial headlined: “Jamaica as last chance for Merkel.”

Arriving at talks alongside Horst Seehofer, leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, Merkel was unable to mask the deep fractures within her own conservative camp.

“We want a stable government for our country,” Seehofer said, repeating his call for a strict upper limit on refugee numbers that Merkel has consistently opposed.

Some conservatives are starting to look towards a post-Merkel era. Daniel Guenther, conservative premier of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, said Germans had a “huge interest” in Merkel leading Germany for another four years.

“But they also want to see how things will proceed afterwards,” he told Focus magazine.

Merkel, 63, has suffered two further setbacks since the national election: the CDU was defeated in a regional election in Lower Saxony on Sunday, and the party’s premier in the eastern state of Saxony resigned on Wednesday, saying younger, fresher leadership was needed to revitalize the conservatives.

Should the three party groups fail to form a coalition, some in their ranks fear this could lead to public disenchantment and fuel further support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time last month.

If she cannot clinch a three-way coalition pact, Merkel could try to form a minority government, or else call fresh elections - an unprecedented scenario.

Alternatively, she could try to team up with the SPD. The Social Democrats reject that scenario, though senior party official Thomas Oppermann has indicated they could reconsider on one condition: Merkel steps aside.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) sank deeper into crisis on Friday as the embattled company said it had lost some customers to competitors because of widespread data falsification that had extended to its mainstream steel sheet business.

Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, which supplies the world’s top airline and automobile manufacturers, also said it had violated statutory standards set by the industry ministry, pushing the scandal beyond failure to meet specifications agreed with customers.

Until now, the 112-year-old company had said products it sold with falsified data met safety and other standards but did not meet contract specifications agreed with customers. It had also said the problem was mainly with aluminium and copper products.

Kobe Steel has an extensive role in global supply chains - the company produces engine valve springs found in half the world’s cars, according to its website.

Kobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara said the company had found a breach of industrial standards at its Hatano copper plant southwest of Tokyo, along with a new case of falsification of data at a unit that cuts and processes steel plate.

”There has been also some impact on our business as we have lost credibility,” Umehara told a news conference, citing cases that the company lost orders and customers switched to its competitors. “But we can’t quantify the impact at the moment.”

He said the Hatano plant did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards for quality management after it faked data on tensile strength and other properties of copper and copper-alloy piping.

Kobe Steel has stopped shipping about 43 percent of copper products from the plant over the problems with the statutory standards, a company spokeswoman said.

Two certification companies said on Thursday they were investigating whether the plant is in line with a global standard on quality control.

They could suspend or cancel the “ISO9001” certification of the plant if it doesn’t meet the standard, which could affect its business as many global buyers require suppliers to use the benchmark.

Kobe Steel said it also found, as the result of a whistleblower, that a plant in western Japan had been ”obstructing company’s voluntary inspection” by concealing data.

After getting a tip that workers at the Chofu plant failed to report data falsification on aluminium extrusion products, the company decided to set up a panel of outsiders, replacing an in-house panel led by the company’s president.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry believes “the data concealment by its employees has hurt the credibility of Kobe Steel’s voluntary investigation,” said Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division.

The ministry ordered the company on Friday to expedite its probes and report results as soon as possible.

Kobe Steel previously said that it found widespread falsification of data on the strength and durability of copper and aluminium products sent to customers. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.

JUSTICE PROBE

Global automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products because of the falsification, although four Japanese carmakers said on Thursday they have found no safety issues with aluminium parts supplied by Kobe Steel.

The company is now subject to a U.S. Justice Department probe while checks continue at hundreds of its clients involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. But in Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.

“We are worried about the U.S. Justice Department probe,” said a source at one of the company’s lenders. “The impact will be very big if the DOJ seeks a criminal case against Kobe and hits it with huge financial penalties.”

The company has started selling assets to raise fund, on Friday holding the first round of an auction to sell its most of a property unit, sources told Reuters on Friday, a deal that reportedly could raise over $400 million.

Kobe Steel’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out.

Kobe Steel shares fell 1.6 percent on Friday. They have fallen nearly 40 percent since it revealed the problems on Oct. 8, wiping about $1.60 billion off its market value.

Are interest rates about to rise in Japan? Is economic growth going to slow slightly? Or maybe global markets are all doomed! Who knows? Two artificial intelligence researchers in Japan say they they're developing a way to predict policy changes from its central bank by watching the split-second changes in facial expression of its chief, Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda usually has a neutral expression and announcements are made in very carefully worded, dry, language after the bank's board decides on a course of action. But the researchers found he displayed fleeting signs of "anger" and "disgust" at news conferences up to seven weeks before two major policy changes. They say it shows Kuruda sensed existing policies weren't cutting it long before the board acted. And afterwards he displayed less sadness in public appearances. Yoshiyuki Suimon says he wants to study Fed chair Janet Yellen and her European counterpart next. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) YOSHIYUKI SUIMON, NOMURA FINANCIAL & ECONOMIC RESEARCH CENTER "Although it's still very basic, we've proved that there is correlation between the governor's facial expression and the decisions being made on monetary policies. I believe we can use this method to predict his next move on future monetary policies." The pair of researchers used a program designed by Microsoft called "Emotion API." They say they're already fielding inquiries from investors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September as the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began to dissipate, but a persistent dearth of properties for sale continued to weigh on overall activity.

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales rose 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million units last month. August’s sales pace was unrevised.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling 1.0 percent to a rate of 5.30 million units last month. Sales were down 1.5 percent from September 2016, the first year-over-year decline since July 2016.

Harvey, which hit Texas in the last week of August, and Irma, which battered Florida in early September, had already affected sales for August. Texas and Florida make up more than 18 percent of the nation’s existing home sales.

The NAR said that Houston’s market had recovered quickly, with a 4 percent gain in September compared to a year ago. Florida’s sales were still down 22 percent compared to this time last year.

Analysts expect that sales in the hurricane-affected areas will rebound further once delays in sales fade. However, the overall housing sector has been slowing as the number of properties available has not kept up with demand.

Supply was down 6.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has declined on a year-on-year basis for more than two years.

The median house price was $245,100 in September, a 4.2 percent rise from a year ago, reflecting the shortage of homes on the market.

“As long as we have a housing shortage, this will lead to affordability issues,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.

At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.5 months a year ago. Economists view a six-month supply as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The median number of days that homes were on the market in September was 34, compared to 39 days a year ago.

Across the regions, sales increased in the West by 3.3 percent and in the Midwest by 1.6 percent. They fell 0.9 percent in the South and were unchanged in the Northeast.

The Commerce Department reported earlier this week that new U.S. single-family home sales fell to a one-year low in September, as Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South.

Once Asia’s biggest commodities trading house, Noble is slashing jobs and selling assets as it slims drastically to cut debt after a crisis-wracked two years.

The Singapore-listed company is focusing on its core Asian coal trading business. In July it agreed to sell its North American gas and power business to Mercuria.

Hong Kong-based Noble flagged earlier this month that it expects to sell its capital-intensive oil liquids business by the end of December, pushing back the timeline by a few months.

One of the sources said an announcement of Vitol’s deal with Noble could come as early as Monday.

Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research accused it of overstating its assets by billions of dollars - allegations that Noble rejected. That pain was exacerbated by a commodities downturn at the time.

The upheaval has also led to rating agency downgrades, fund raising and management changes, while Noble’s market value has plummeted to less than $400 million from $6 billion in February 2015. Its stock is down about 80 percent this year.

Noble reported a net loss of $1.75 billion for April-June, citing a tough market.

Shares in the company were halted earlier on Friday, pending the “announcement of a major transaction”, Noble said.

The sources declined to be identified because Vitol’s purchase of the Noble unit has not been made public. Details of the transaction were unavailable.

Vitol and an external spokeswoman for Noble declined to comment.

Noble is a big player in the global physical oil market, trading crude and refined products. But its operations shrank this year due to higher prices and liquidity constraints.

The company has blending and wholesale capabilities in North America and the Caribbean, alongside long-term storage leases globally.

Noble has also said North American lenders to the company have extended the deadline for a $2 billion credit facility by three months to Jan. 15.

The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.
Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad’s wishes.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties.

The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.

The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.

The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.

Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

Iraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.

Sistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.

ACCUSATIONS

Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Iraq’s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war.

Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.

Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.

Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.

“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.

“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.

An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.

Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Business Secretary Greg Clark will hold talks in Canada on Friday to discuss Airbus SE’s plans to buy a majority stake in Bombardier’s C-Series jetliner program aimed at helping it avoid high U.S. import tariffs.

Clark will meet with Canadian government officials and executives from the two manufacturers, according to a spokeswoman for the ministry for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

A deal announced earlier this week gives Airbus (AIR.PA) a controlling stake in the Canadian manufacturer’s troubled C-Series jets, which are partly made in Northern Ireland.

The tie up gives Bombardier (BBDb.TO) a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N), in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose 300 percent import duties, potentially threatening thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.

Under the deal, Airbus would take a 50.01 percent stake in the C Series and add an assembly line for the plane in Alabama, thus becoming a U.S.-made product so it can avoid anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.

The Boeing-Bombardier dispute has snowballed into a bigger multilateral trade dispute, with British Prime Minister Theresa May wading into the debate and asking U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene in order save British jobs.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, which is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four nations and remains mired in political sensitivities after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.

Clark and Northern Irish politicians had welcomed the Airbus deal and promised to work with the firms to protect the workforce in the province. Bombardier makes the C-Series CS100 and CS300 state-of-the-art carbon wings at a plant in Belfast.

China box office revenues to bounce back in 2017: regulator

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s movie box office revenue is expected to grow in 2017 at more than three times the pace of last year thanks to the success of blockbusters like “Wolf Warrior 2”, the media regulator said on Friday.
The Chinese Communist Party is supporting Hollywood-style films that portray China as the rejuvenated great power described in this week’s speech by President Xi Jinping to the Party Congress.

Takings would rise 11.6 percent to 55 billion yuan ($8.31 billion) this year, beating 2016 growth of 3.7 percent, said Zhang Hongsen, vice minister of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television.

“The rapid development of the film industry has been a big bright spot for China’s culture industry,” Zhang told a press conference in Beijing.

The Chinese Communist Party is supporting Hollywood-style films that portray China as the rejuvenated great power described in this week’s speech by President Xi Jinping to the Party Congress.

“Wolf Warrior 2”, a patriotic action movie that has raked in 5.6 billion yuan ($845.59 million) to become China’s highest-grossing film, depicts a Chinese hero fighting Western mercenaries in a war-torn African country.

While privately financed, the film has received strong support from state organizations, and China’s film regulators have submitted it in the foreign-language category at the 2018 Oscars.

Sun Zhijun, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party Central Committee, said films should have social and “educational” benefits, not just make money.

“We cannot take market share, distribution figures, box office and audience ratings as the sole standard. We cannot be the slave of the market and led by the nose,” he said at the same press conference.

After disappointing box office growth in 2016, regulators announced that all sales grosses would include service fees for each ticket purchased online. This has boosted this year’s growth, although moviemakers see little of the additional revenue.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Friday in see-saw trade, under pressure from weak U.S. demand but drawing support from a sharp decline in Iraqi crude exports due to tensions in the Kurdistan region.
Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.
Olivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.
“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year.

U.S. light crude CLc1 was 10 cents higher at $51.39. Brent crude LCOc1 was up 24 cents at $57.47 a barrel by 11:44 a.m. EST.

“We’ve continued to see signs that the market needs a steady drumbeat of positive information,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research for Tradition Energy. “This week’s DOE report where gasoline demand dropped to its lowest since March gave a little pause to that.”

Oil exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan via the Turkish port of Ceyhan were flowing at average rates of 216,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from the usual flows of around 600,000 bpd, a shipping source said.

Iraqi troops regained control of two major oilfields northwest of Kirkuk from Kurdish Peshmerga forces this week, and the oil ministry in Baghdad expects to bring the fields back on stream on Sunday.

Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.

Olivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.

Analysts said the market was on a path toward rebalancing.

“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.

U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year. C-STK-T-EIA

Part of this drawdown has been due to rising exports as a result of the steep discount of U.S. crude to Brent, which makes it attractive for American producers to export their oil. CL-LCO1=R

Crude oil for immediate use now carries a premium over forward futures, making it profitable to sell oil produced now rather than storing it for sale later.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that overseas U.S. crude oil shipments have soared from virtually zero before the government loosened export restrictions in late 2015 to around 2.6 million bpd in October.

“While outbound shipments recently approached 2 million bpd, our math suggests that physical bottlenecks are unlikely to kick in until waterborne exports approach 3.2 million bpd,” RBC Capital Markets said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A self-proclaimed psychic who was paid $3.5 million by an elderly Massachusetts woman in exchange for claiming to cleanse her of demons pleaded guilty on Thursday to trying to avoid paying taxes.

Sally Ann Johnson, 41, for more than seven years provided what she described as healing services to a resident of the island of Martha’s Vineyard, who was more than 70 years old when she first met the spiritual healer, according to court papers.

Johnson, who ran businesses including Psychic Match Inc and Flatiron Psychic, admitted in Boston federal court that she tried to impede the administration of tax laws.

Johnson, who told the court she never passed the second grade, called herself a Romani “spiritual consultant.” She said in court she had not paid taxes in connection with the money she received as income as well as a gift.

“I honestly did not do the right thing,” she said.

Johnson, who has resided in New York, Florida, Illinois and at times Massachusetts, faces up to three years in prison.

She is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17. Her lawyers declined to comment.

According to court papers, Johnson at various times lived with the unnamed woman on Martha’s Vineyard, a favorite vacation spot for the rich and famous.

In an effort to evade the IRS’s scrutiny, Johnson, using the alias Angela Johnson, directed the woman to make payments in the name of Sally Johnson and another of her businesses, Stones of the World, charging papers said.

Johnson directed the woman to wire payments to three different bank accounts including one in the name of an associate who used at least two aliases, court papers said.

Johnson made significant cash withdrawals from those accounts and also accrued charges on a credit card held in the woman’s name, according to charging documents.

Three of Merck’s U.S. sales teams will be cut, spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said in an emailed statement. She declined to comment on which teams are being eliminated.

The aim is “to better support changes in our business in the United States,” Gillespie said.

Earlier this month, Merck said it would not seek regulatory approval for once-promising cholesterol drug anacetrapib after disappointing trial results.

Last month, the drugmaker discontinued developing an experimental drug combination for chronic hepatitis C, as competition rises and patient population shrinks. The company has previously written off an earlier hepatitis C program.

Other pharmaceutical companies have also downsized. Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) earlier this month said it would lay off about 8 percent of its employees as the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks over the past year in the development of two potential blockbuster drugs, works to cut costs.

Merck said none of the jobs being eliminated are being moved outside of the United States.

The Italian coastguard puts the number at 5,000 on Monday (June 26) alone. Rescuers hauling people from overcrowded, ill-equipped boats. Libya has become the preferred jumping-off point for human traffickers. A deal between the EU and Turkey last year blocking a once busy passage to Greece.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Pope Francis dove into some of the United States' thorniest political debates during his historic visit by urging the world's wealthiest nation to welcome immigrants, to end homelessness and do more to address climate change.
Sometimes his political messages were blunt, like when he pleaded before the U.S. Congress for Americans to end "hostility" toward immigrants.

Pope Francis dove into some of the United States' thorniest political debates during his historic visit by urging the world's wealthiest nation to welcome immigrants, to end homelessness and do more to address climate change.



Sometimes his political messages were blunt, like when he pleaded before the U.S. Congress for Americans to end "hostility" toward immigrants. Other times, they were more subtle, like the climate-conscious pope's decision to ride around in a tiny Fiat rather than a gas-guzzling SUV.

While Vatican officials said the pope was only re-stating Church social teachings and not making political statements in his first U.S. visit ever, many in the public and across the political landscape saw it differently.

Three of Merck’s U.S. sales teams will be cut, spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said in an emailed statement. She declined to comment on which teams are being eliminated.

The aim is “to better support changes in our business in the United States,” Gillespie said.

Earlier this month, Merck said it would not seek regulatory approval for once-promising cholesterol drug anacetrapib after disappointing trial results.

Last month, the drugmaker discontinued developing an experimental drug combination for chronic hepatitis C, as competition rises and patient population shrinks. The company has previously written off an earlier hepatitis C program.

Other pharmaceutical companies have also downsized. Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) earlier this month said it would lay off about 8 percent of its employees as the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks over the past year in the development of two potential blockbuster drugs, works to cut costs.

Merck said none of the jobs being eliminated are being moved outside of the United States.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga, who says he will boycott a presidential election re-run due next week, said on Friday he would announce a “way forward” the day before the scheduled poll, raising the possibility he might participate after all.

At a memorial in western Kenya for opposition supporters killed in protests against the vote set for Oct. 26, Odinga told his supporters not to attack “innocent people” including people who support his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta.

He did not comment on an announcement by the electoral board chief executive Ezra Chiloba earlier on Friday that he would take three weeks’ leave.

Kenya is holding the re-run after the Supreme Court threw out the result of an Aug. 8 election won by the incumbent Kenyatta but disputed by the challenger Odinga. The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud.

The opposition has demanded Chiloba resign, and the announcement that he will not participate in running the vote suggests progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations involving Western diplomats and religious and civil society leaders.

Uncertainty over whether Odinga will participate in the election and concerns that it may not proceed peacefully have left Kenya, a traditionally stable Western ally in an often chaotic region, mired in political crisis.

The volatile build-up to the Oct. 26 vote has revived memories for Kenyans of ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a disputed election in 2007, when Odinga also lost and disputed the result.

Chiloba told Reuters that, in light of the opposition’s demands, he was going on leave, and that all arrangements for next week’s vote were in place.

At least 45 people died nationwide in a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the August vote, including a six-month old baby struck on the head by a police baton.

With Odinga yet to respond to Chiloba’s decision to go on leave, diplomats said they were unsure what would happen next.

“The crystal ball is very cloudy at the moment,” a senior western diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters. “The situation is changing by the hour.”

REVIEW OF BOYCOTT?

The electoral board has said next week’s election will go ahead. Odinga met its chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday and later told reporters that if there were serious consultations and serious reforms, the opposition could review its boycott.

Chebukati had said a day earlier that he could not guarantee the election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against colleagues. A fellow board member resigned this week after fleeing to the United States, saying she feared for her life.

The opposition has held near-daily protests demanding electoral reforms and the sacking of board officials. Police said on Friday four people were killed as a result of their interventions to stop demonstrations.

Kenyatta has meanwhile urged Kenyans to come out in large numbers to vote, insisting the ballot be held. On Thursday, he snubbed an invitation to meet Chebukati, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning.

In a speech in Nairobi on Friday, Kenyatta said the election must not divide the nation or push it to the brink.

Disruptions of the vote by “those who thrive in chaos and relish anarchy” would not be tolerated, and security forces “have been enhanced and appropriately deployed to maintain law and order”, he said.

Senate Republicans clear a crucial hurdle on Thursday with a vote allowing them to cut taxes without Democratic support. The bill passing Thursday night after Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was able to scrap together a majority. Now the real debate begins. President Trump and Republican leaders are hoping to simplify the tax code by lowering rates and removing popular carve outs. But they're already at odds over whether wealthy families should get a tax cut and whether popular tax breaks should be preserved. And there are budget hawks like Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee who say they'll refuse to vote for any tax plan that would increase the national debt. The White House and Republican leaders saying that tax cuts will pay for themselves through faster economic growth - but independent tax experts saying that's not likely. The debate is certain to heat up as interest groups of all stripes mobilize to protect their perks.

Signs of poor demand for the iPhone 8 sent Apple's stock lower on Thursday. Canada's largest mobile network Rogers Communication said appetite for the product has been "anemic." Verizon also admitted that the number of upgrades in the third quarter was lower than in previous years. A newspaper in Taiwan reported Apple has cut production orders on iPhone 8 by more than 50 percent for the rest of the year. A number of sector analysts played down the concerns. Michael Bapis of Bapis Group at HighTower: (SOUNDBITE) MICHAEL BAPIS, PARTNER, BAPIS GROUP AT HIGHTOWER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "You might see a pullback in Apple. I don't think it's going to be long term. The only thing that would cause Apple to really get hammered is if the glitches don't get fixed. If the demand for the iPhone 8 really does slow down a lot more than people are anticipating. I know there was a glitch with the software updates and, most likely, they'll figure it out. You could see a small pullback just in the markets in general and that could cause Apple to pull back, but today I couldn't find anything that wouldn't give us any reason to panic yet." Apple released iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in September. Its new iPhone X is coming out in early November.
