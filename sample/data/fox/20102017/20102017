"I believe her."

That's what Amber Tamblyn revealed Thursday on Twitter after reaching out to actress Charlyne Yi, who accused Tamblyn's husband David Cross of making racist comments years ago.

Tamblyn, 34, has been married to Cross, 53, since 2012.

The controversy began when Yi wrote a series of tweets Monday about the first time she met the comedian 10 years ago:

Cross posted a lengthy note on Twitter in response to the allegations Wednesday. While Cross claimed he didn’t remember the exchange, he did apologize for offending Yi.

“I would never intentionally hurt someone like that,” he explained. “I do not remember doing this when I met her. I do remember meeting her though. She was the then girlfriend of a good friend of mine and we were about to start working on a movie together. I am NOT accusing Charlene [sic] of lying and I’m truly sorry if I hurt her, it was never my intention to do that.”

Cross also thought he was portraying a Southern “redneck character" in a joking matter.

“I have NEVER said ‘ching chong, ching chong’ unless I was doing some a-----e redneck racist character,” he added.

Tamblyn previously supported her husband when a Twitter user reached out to her about the allegations.

While Yi, 31, hasn't commented on her meeting with Tamblyn, the comedienne did hint she felt more at ease after going public with her encounter.

In 2012, “Facts of Life” star Mindy Cohn found out she was battling cancer.

“I was walking around my neighborhood in Los Angeles and I suddenly got so tired,” the actress recalled to People magazine. “I just couldn’t go anymore. This was before Uber was really a thing, so I texted my friend Helen Hunt and said, ‘Something’s wrong with me. I need help.’”

She said after going to the doctor she found out she had breast cancer.

“It was breast cancer,” she said. “I kept that secret for a long time.”

The 51-year-old underwent a double mastectomy and chemotherapy to battle the illness.

“I’ve always been an optimist,” she told People. “But the cancer metastasized. It kept spreading and coming back... I was frustrated and enraged. I couldn’t control any of this. I couldn’t fix it.”

These days, she is cancer-free and healthy.

After taking some time off from acting, Cohn is ready to get back into the biz.

“I’m feeling great,” she said. “And I’m so ready to get back to working. I think I’m a good actress, and I have a lot to offer. I’m excited to see what I get to do next!”

One week after Dove made a public apology for a racially offensive Facebook ad, another skincare giant has been accused of belittling women of color with a campaign for skin lightening cream.

On Wednesday, social media users all over the globe blasted a series of billboards and television commercials for Nivea’s new Natural Fairness moisturizer, marketed to women living in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Senegal, The Sun reported.

In the campaign, as the former Miss Nigeria Omowunmi Akinnifesi applies the moisturizer, her skin turns noticeably lighter.

STAR OF 'RACIST' DOVE AD SAYS COMPANY SHOULD'VE DEFENDED ITS 'CREATIVE VISION'

“I need a product that I can really trust to restore my skin's natural fairness,” Akinnifesi says. “Now I have visibly fairer skin, making me feel younger.”

Across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, users started sharing the hashtag #PULLITDOWNNOW to protest the ad and petition for its removal.

“This is why black businesses need to rise up and cater for our needs. Nivea can’t get away with pushing this skin lightening agenda across Africa. Appalling,” tweeted British entrepreneur William Adoasi.

THIS 'NO BRA DAY' BREAST CANCER AWARENESS CAMPAIGN MADE PEOPLE VERY ANGRY

Others chimed in with similar outrage, noting the "very dangerous issue of colorism" and questioning the meaning "overactive melanin" in the moisturizer’s product description.

However, there is a demand for skin-lightening products throughout Africa, Metro reports. According to a recent study by the University of Cape Town, about 75 percent of Nigerian women use skin lightening products, which are also popular in Ghana, Senegal and Kenya, according to the site. Similar products are also in high demand across East Asia.

Starbucks has come under fire for their not-so-festive holiday cups in the past, but this year they appear to be going all-out.

Earlier this week, a Reddit user by the name of DarthSpoopy shared a photo of what was allegedly Starbucks’ brand new holiday cups for 2017. The post was removed from Reddit shortly afterward, but not before fans and news outlets were able to capture screengrabs:

“Just got it in our order,” the user wrote at the top of his Reddit post. “Holiday cup short design!??”

IS STARBUCKS RELEASING A 'ZOMBIE FRAPPUCCINO'?

The cups in the photo — or the short ones, at least — feature the Starbucks logo surrounded by red and green holiday-themed doodles. Included among the artwork are doves, hearts, snowflakes, a Christmas tree, a stack of presents, and, oddly, what appear to be two of the old Starbucks holiday cups from years’ past.

It’s still unclear how the Redditor obtained a photo of these cups in the first place, though the caption suggests that he/she works at a Starbucks.

STARBUCKS RELEASES CAMO SLEEVE IN HONOR OF VETERAN EMPLOYEES

If the cups are in fact the official Starbucks holiday drinkware for 2017, they’re a far cry from the Starbucks cup designs that caused controversy in 2015. That year, the coffee chain nixed the snowflakes, inspirational quotes and ornaments featured on previous years’ cups, and instead released a simple set of red cups featuring the green Starbucks logo.

Christian groups, in particular, began claiming the company was trying to remove all references to Christmas from the cups. On group called it a “war on Christmas,” while another evangelist in Arizona said Starbucks had “removed Christmas” from its cups because “they hate Jesus.”

Volcanoes helped topple ancient Egyptian empire, study finds

The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C.

“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Sun-choking debris cast off by volcanoes more than 2,000 years ago starved headwaters feeding the Nile river and hastened the downfall of ancient Egypt’s last kingdom, researchers claim.

Eruptions in the 3rd and 1st century B.C. — including one of the biggest blasts in the past 2,500 years — coincided with crop failures, large-scale revolts and the withdrawal of Egyptian armies from the battlefield, they reported in the journal Nature Communications.

Up to now, researchers had struggled to find an explanation for these events.

“Volcanic eruptions may have had a central role in the eventual collapse of the Ptolemaic dynasty,” the journal noted in a summary.

The findings, the authors said, also highlight the risk today of climate engineering schemes that would combat global warming by injecting billions of tiny particles into the stratosphere — just like a volcano — to block some of the sun’s rays.

Even if so-called solar radiation management lowers the planet’s temperature a notch or two, it could inadvertently cause major disruptions in rainfall patterns.

“Ptolemaic vulnerability to volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agriculture regions,” which today include 70 percent of the world’s population, the authors wrote.

The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C. with the suicide of Cleopatra. After that, the region became a Roman province.

The kingdom mostly thrived, nourished by the silt-rich Nile overflowing its banks in summer across a far-flung network of grain fields. An ingenious system of channels and dams stored water after the river receded in September.

VIOLENT UPRISINGS

“When the flood was good, the Nile Valley was one of the most agriculturally productive places in the ancient world,” said Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College Dublin and co-author of the study.

But in some years, the river failed to rise, and trouble followed. Why this happened was not known.

Drawing from climate models, Greenland ice cores, and ancient Egyptian writings, researchers led by Joseph Manning of Yale University pieced together a narrative that showed an unmistakeable link with major volcanic eruptions around the world.

In 245 B.C., for example, the ruler Ptolemy III suddenly, and inexplicably, abandoned a successful military campaign against his arch nemesis, the Seleucid Empire, centred in present-day Syria and Iraq.

“This about-face changed everything about Near East history,” Manning said.

Historical records also pointed to simultaneous food shortages due to insufficient flooding of the Nile, as well as violent uprisings in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which stretched across northeast Africa and parts of the Middle East.

A similar confluence of social upheaval, disease and starvation struck the empire in its final two decades.

Both periods of turmoil, the researchers found, coincided with major volcanic eruptions.

From more recent records, scientists know that the tens of millions of tons of sulphur dioxide particles ejected into the upper atmosphere by a major eruption can prevent monsoon weather from moving far enough north of the equator to thoroughly soak the Ethiopian highlands, the headwaters of the Nile.

This happened in 939 when Eldgja, in Iceland, blew its top, and again in 1783-84, when Iceland’s Laki erupted.

The Islamic Nilometer, a log of Nile water levels since 622, showed a corresponding impact on the river.

“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.

“But they likely added fuel to existing economic, political and ethnic tensions.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
A witness to the deadly rampage inside a Maryland granite company said the suspect, Radee Prince, had gathered a small group of his co-workers together by saying "come with me, I want to say something to everybody." Without another word, he opened fire.

The witness, a man who worked at the countertop making company for a year and a half, said when Prince arrived on Wednesday morning he responded to a polite greeting with harsh language describing Advanced Granite Solutions and its workers. Then he tried to talk individually to a few employees.

"He talked to me first," said the man, who spoke Thursday to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was afraid of retaliation and worried about his family's immigration status. "Then I saw him talk to another friend. Nobody listened to him, because his reaction was to start a fight."

The employee said Prince had approached him a month ago and angrily accused him of gossiping. Since then, the man had been even more worried about Prince.

Prince, 37, of Elkton, Maryland, had a history of violence with co-workers, especially when he believed people were talking behind his back, according to court documents. Authorities have not released a motive, but the witness said Prince's aggressiveness had been escalating recently.

Prince is accused of fatally shooting three colleagues and critically wounding two others. Authorities said he then drove to Wilmington, Delaware, and shot an acquaintance at a used car lot. He was captured after a 10-hour manhunt.

Prince faces charges of murder, attempted murder, assault and use of a firearm to commit a felony. At his arraignment Thursday in Delaware, he pleaded not guilty.

According to an affidavit, officers found a .380-caliber semi-automatic they saw Prince throw away while running from them, and they found the same size shells at the Wilmington shooting scene. Police think it's the same gun he used in the Maryland shooting.

The granite company employee said he worked on a small fabrication team, and that several of his colleagues had complained before Wednesday to supervisors about Prince's behavior.

Just before the shooting, Prince walked out to his SUV and put on a black jacket, the witness said. Then he walked back inside and stood near a machine with an odd look on his face. Prince then called the man's name, and asked him and his colleagues to come toward him.

"I was nervous," the witness said, adding that he believes he was the one Prince was trying to target.

The man said once the group gathered around, Prince shot Enis Mrvoljak, 48, of Dundalk. Then, Bayarsaikhan Tudev, 53, of Arlington, Virginia. He also killed Jose Hidalgo Romero, 34, of Aberdeen, authorities said.

Tudev's widow told the AP that her husband was so worried about Prince's temper that he prayed about him.

"He was always angry," Gerelmaa Dolgorsuren said her husband told her about Prince.

Prince also shot at the witness as he ran away; he lost a boot while trying to flee, he said.

Melody Starling, who identified herself as Prince's half-sister, told The News Journal that he is an angry, paranoid man with an explosive temper. She also called him a "psychopath" who should have been committed to a mental health facility.

Ron Cherry, an attorney for the company, said he could not answer questions about what happened.

But Cristie Kahler, a spokeswoman for the Harford County Sheriff's Office, confirmed that video from a surveillance camera at the company showed Prince seeming to call a meeting before the shooting. She could not provide further details.

Kahler also said that investigators were aware that employees had complained about Prince's behavior at Advanced Granite Solutions, as well as at prior workplaces.

Prince had 43 arrests in Delaware. He has faced charges of being a felon in possession of a gun, was habitually late paying his rent, was repeatedly cited for traffic violations, and was ordered to undergo drug and alcohol counseling in recent years.

He had at least two other violent run-ins with co-workers. In 2014, he put a colleague in a chokehold because he thought he was talking about Prince, a manager told police. Prince dragged the co-worker outside and slammed him to the ground, causing him to lose consciousness.

Prince was charged with offensive touching, but the case was dismissed last year. It's not clear why.

Earlier this year, Prince was fired from JPS Marble and Granite after he punched a co-worker and threatened other colleagues, according to court documents. His former boss became so scared of Prince after he was fired that he tried to take out a restraining order on him. A judge didn't grant it.

Late Thursday, authorities identified the wounded in Maryland as Enoc Villegas Sosa, 38, and Jose Roberto Flores Gillen, 37. They remain in critical condition.

Police in Delaware have not updated the condition of the victim there, but have said he is expected to survive. Prince was accused last year of punching that man and trying to rob him, said Nicole Magnusson, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice.

He was charged with robbery and offensive touching, but that case was also dismissed. It's not clear why.

Senate Republicans narrowly passed a $4 trillion budget plan Thursday, taking their first big step toward a tax reform package promised by President Donald Trump.

Approval of the nonbinding plan allows the Senate to use a special process known as "budget reconciliation" that would forestall a Democratic filibuster.

"Tonight we completed the first step towards replacing our broken tax code by passing a comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget that will help put the federal government on a path to balance," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a failing tax code that holds Americans back with one that works for them."



The Senate plan, approved on a 51-49 vote, calls for $473 billion in cuts from Medicare over 10 years and more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.

If fully implemented, the plan would cut spending by more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years, with an average of approximately $540 billion per year over the life of the plan, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only Republican to vote against the bill, joining all 46 Democrats and two independents.

Almost 400 mysterious stone structures dating back thousands of years have been discovered in Saudi Arabia, with a few of these wall-like formations draping across old lava domes, archaeologists report.

Many of the stone walls, which archaeologists call "gates" because they resemble field gates from above, were found in clusters in a region in west-central Saudi Arabia called Harrat Khaybar.

The archaeologists involved in the research aren't sure of the purpose, or even the exact age, of these gates. [See Images of the Mysterious Stone Structures in Saudi Arabia]

Long and mysterious

Discovered mainly through satellite images, a few of the gates are actually located on the side of a volcanic dome that once spewed basaltic lava, researchers found.

The gates "are stone-built, the walls roughly made and low," David Kennedy, a professor at the University of Western Australia, wrote in a paper set to be published in the November issue of the journal Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy. The gates "appear to be the oldest man-made structures in the landscape," Kennedy noted, adding that "no obvious explanation of their purpose can be discerned."

The smallest of the gates extends about 43 feet (13 meters), while the longest is 1,699 feet (518 m) long, or longer than an NFL football field. Many have multiple stone walls that, in some instances, form a rectangular design; some of the others, called "I" type gates, have only one stone wall with heaps of stone at each end.

"Gates are found almost exclusively in bleak, inhospitable lava fields with scant water or vegetation, places seemingly amongst the most unwelcoming to our species," Kennedy wrote. Thousands of years ago, he noted, the landscape was more hospitable to human life. Other types of stone structures — such as "kites," which were used to hunt animals, and "wheels," named for their shape — have also been discovered in these lava fields.

The kites, wheels and other types of stone structures were typically found to be built on top of these gate-like walls, suggesting that the gates predate these stone structures, Kennedy said. The remains of lava flows are also sometimes found on top of the gates, indicating that the gates are also older than some of the flows, Kennedy said.

Need for fieldwork

Most of the gates were discovered through satellite surveys, and no archaeological fieldwork has been conducted on them. However, in the 1980s, before the gates were discovered, volcanologists Vic Camp and John Roobolmapped an area of the Harrat Khaybar that included a lava dome festooned with gates and other stone structures. This lava dome is located near a taller lava dome, called Jabal Abyad,which means "white mountain" in Arabic.

The lava domes are no longer active, Camp said, adding that in the past, basaltic lava covered some of the stone structures, including the gates.

"We see several areas where the younger lavas are devoid of such [stone] structures, although surrounded by several [stone structures]," Camp told Live Science. One of the stone structures is partially covered in hardened lava, photographs show. Camp estimates that some of the gates around the lava dome were built around 7,000 years ago.

Archaeological fieldwork is necessary to determine what the gates are and when, exactly, they date to, Kennedy said.

Travis Hearn, a research assistant with the Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East, contributed to the journal article; and Kennedy also worked with members of the Desert Team, a group of Saudi Arabian citizens who were the first to map some of the stone structures and visit some of the sites.

Anthony Lentini, the man behind Lentini Farms, tells Fox News that his corn maze became a means to sustain the farm when prices and demand fluctuated over a decade ago.

THE BEST WAY TO GRILL CORN? GO AGAINST THIS INSTINCT

“My wife and I wanted to reinvent the farm, and we saw that the kids were coming into the business and we needed to have more income coming in," says Lentini. "I read about someone doing it out West, and that’s what gave me the idea.”

Lentini Farms is located in Newton, N.J., and during the fall season its 10-acre corn maze (complete with with 10-foot corn stalks) attracts adventure-seekers far and wide — and young and old.

“We’re always busy!” Lentini now says.

The adventure doesn't stop once visitors are done with the corn maze, either — although that alone can take between 20 minutes to 2 hours. Visitors can also stop by the pumpkin fields to pick their own pumpkins, or take a haunted hayride across a terrifying swath of Lentini Farms.

Corn maze prices start at $8 for children ages 4 to 11, and $10 for adults ages 12 and up. Children under 3 are free.

Toyota and its luxury sister brand Lexus took the top two spots in the latest Consumer Reports reliability rankings, marking the fifth year in a row the one of Toyota's makes has led the list.

Kia, Audi and BMW filled out the rest of the top five, while Cadillac, GMC, Ram, Dodge and Volvo were ranked the lowest,

Compaints about infotainment systems and new transmissions plagued the lowest ranked automakers, while Toyota's slow and steady implementation of new technologies paid off with high marks.

Consumer Reports predicts reliability of 2018 vehicles based on a survey of its subscribers, who owned or leased 640,000 vehicles from the 2000-2017 model years. Consumer Reports forecasts how a model will perform based on recent data for that model. The magazine gives more weight to mechanical and safety issues than minor problems like wind noise.

The magazine's rankings are closely watched in the industry, since many buyers seek advice from Consumer Reports.

Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, says Toyota's strategy of adding new technology gradually — instead of all at once — helps make its vehicles more reliable. Toyota's new Camry sedan, for example, has an eight-speed transmission that was first tested on the Highlander SUV.

Kia has also steadily climbed in the rankings because it uses proven technology that has already been tested by its sister brand, Hyundai, which slipped in the rankings. Consumer Reports found that the Kia Niro hybrid, which went on sale earlier this year, was the most reliable vehicle in its entire survey.

Audi and BMW also have better-than-average infotainment systems because they were some of the first to market with them more than a decade ago.

"They've had all those growing pains," Fisher said.

By contrast, Buick dropped from third to eighth in the rankings because of troubles with its new 2017 LaCrosse sedan, which has a new eight-speed transmission, new engine and new electronic shifter, among other features. Fisher said other recent Buicks, like the Envision, went on sale in China or Europe first and got some kinks worked out before heading to the U.S.

Electric cars escaped some of those reliability problems because they have fewer parts. General Motors Co. didn't fare well overall, but its new Chevrolet Bolt electric car had above-average reliability. In its debut on the list, Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 sedan got an "average" reliability score. The car isn't widely available yet, but the magazine based its ranking on responses for the company's Model S sedan, which has above-average reliability.

"There's a lot of stuff that's not in electric cars. They're simpler," Fisher said.

Chrysler was the biggest climber in the rankings, thanks to consumer reviews of its new Pacifica minivan. Acura fell the furthest, hurt by problems with the transmissions on several of its new models.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Hillary Clinton drew parallels between Harvey Weinstein and President Donald Trump, calling the disgraced Hollywood mogul's behavior "disgusting" and "heartbreaking" ― just like the person once caught on camera bragging about sexually assaulting women. In an interview Sunday with Britain's "The Andrew Marr Show," the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee commended women who have stepped forward to share stories of their encounters with Weinstein and emphasized that this type of lecherous behavior can't be tolerated in any industry, including politics. "After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office," she said. Trump was captured in a 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape bragging he can kiss women and "grab them by the p***y" without invitation." Also, Hollywood veteran Jane Fonda has revealed she learned of the allegations against mogul Harvey Weinstein a year ago -- but said nothing. Fonda, 79, made the admission in an interview on BBC World News HARDtalk, saying that she chose to keep quiet because "it didn't happen to me". Kayleigh McEnany, the newest RNC Spokesperson, and former CNN Commentator sorted through the hypocrisy on the Todd Starnes Show today.

McEnany on Harvey Weinstein's connection to the Clinton family:

Harvey Weinstein we know has been accused of rape from multiple women, sexual assault, these horrific things. He's given so much money to the democratic party and look, the Clinton's specifically; nearly a quarter of a million to the Clinton Foundation. And Fox News really unearthed a golden nugget this morning when they found that this sexual predator Harvey Weinstein had actually donated $10,000 to a man accused of sexual assault, to his legal defense. That man would be Bill Clinton. So he tried to help fend off some of those accusations about Bill Clinton by donating to his legal defense fund. It's appalling and Hillary Clinton if you want to stand for women, give back that money because that will say more to sexual assault victims anywhere than your words will.

Also, regarding the possibility of Hillary Clinton running again in 2020 McEnany said, "We would relish a Hillary Clinton nomination... It would be an absolute disaster."

You can now get your reading list from one of the country's founding fathers.

FOX's Lilian Woo reports:

Thomas Jefferson hand selected some of the most important books of his time for the library at the University of Virginia, which he created, and now hundreds of them are available to the public online, which is in keeping with what our third President believed: At a time when books were very expensive he thought it was the duty of the university to make great works available.

Many of his initial list, 7,000 books on topics ranging from Agriculture to Zoology didn't make it, lost in a fire in the 1800's, but thanks to a 40-year search by a librarian at the school, more than 330 legal works have been collected so that people today can read for themselves. The same books Jefferson wanted for fine legal minds of his time.

45th President of the United States Donald Trump joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss his tax reform plan as well as healthcare, the Iran deal, NFL and more. Listen to the full interview below:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRIAN KILMEADE: So, I know this is a big week. How important is getting this budget passed? To even get to the tax reform conversation, Mr. President?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, it's very important. I mean we need the budget, we need the passage. We have Thad Cochran, as you know, is not feeling so great. He may not be able to vote. We don't know what John McCain's going to do. We have a couple of others that maybe could disappoint us, but maybe they won't.

They've been talking about all sorts of things for so long, now they have a President who's really willing to sign what we have to sign. But I think we're going to be good, and I think we're going to be good for taxes. And it's very close, because we have no support from the democrats. They're obstructionists, all they want to do is obstruct. So we have 48 votes against us. So we literally can't lose more than two votes, which is a pretty tough situation.

KILMEADE: On tax reform or the budget -- on the budget in particular right?

TRUMP: On the budget. Well we have phase one and phase two. Phase one, we have to think only - I'm only right now thinking about the budget.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: Phase two is tax, because that will next week. But phase one is the budget. And if we get the budget, I think we'll be in good shape to get the tax, but we have to get the budget.

KILMEADE: I talked to Senator Joe Manchin yesterday who really seems to enjoy your interactions. And he says if they could give me a little something, I could deliver six to eight democrats. Number one, do you believe that? And number two, are you willing to negotiate?

TRUMP: Well we'll be talking to Joe. I think it's hard for Joe to vote against tax cuts. We're talking about massive tax cuts --

KILMEADE: In West Virginia?

TRUMP: In West Virginia. And I've turned West Virginia around, because what I've done environmentally with coal. And I don't know if you saw, but West Virginia is second to Texas in percentage increase of GDP. And everyone's saying "I can't believe it," because they were having such problems. But, I think it's very hard for Joe, I think it's very hard for other people to vote especially where I'm very popular in their states, and they're coming up for election to vote against the largest tax cut in the history of our country. People need their money, where the government is taking too much money. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We need the tax cuts.

KILMEADE: So what Mick Mulvaney brought up to me this morning on television was no one talks about the zero percent, because they have up to $24,000, you're not going to pay any tax, that's part of tax reform -

TRUMP: Right.

KILMEADE: Also, people are focused on the corporate rate deduction, what about the small business?

TRUMP: So small business is coming way down. And if you talk about the zero, I said "You've got to put the zero in," they were saying "We have three brackets." I said "I know you like to say we only have three brackets as opposed to seven or eight, but you've got to put the zero in." So I said "Make it four." And the democrats, Schumer and all, were using that - and they were using it as bait. Now they can't use it anymore, because where they're paying a much higher rate - paying a very high rate, right now a lot of people are going to pay zero.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: Then we go to a 12 percent, as an example, it comes down from 15 - but it really comes down from much higher than that. So it's a great tax cut for the middle class, but - hey look, even the middle class will say it's an unbelievable tax cut for business, which is going to employ people. And the biggest beneficiary will be the middle class.

KILMEADE: So you golfed with Rand Paul over the weekend, and I think most agree, including Mark Short (ph) this morning, said that he's going to be the greatest challenge, because he does not like to vote for budgets or tax reform. I mean, can you be friends -

TRUMP: I think he's definitely with us.

KILMEADE: -- can you be friendly with someone that's going to vote against that? Have you talked to him?

TRUMP: I've had a great relationship with Rand Paul, and I think he's going to be with us. I think in the end he's going to be with us. I hope John McCain's going to be with us, we just don't know yet. We have a couple of votes, and of course that is in a position where it may be impossible for him to be here, which is a big - that's like a no vote. That's almost the equivalent to a no vote. And the problem is we have no democrats. We have absolutely no democrat votes, so -

KILMEADE: Have you tried?

TRUMP: Yes, we've tried. They're in a box (ph), they have 48 votes, and all they want to do is obstruct. Now, I think we'll have democrats if we get through the budget - we have to get through the budget first.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: If we get through the budget, we have the taxes. I think we're going to have some democrats, especially in states where I did very well. I mean I had some states where I won be 30 and 40 points.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: And that's a big margin. And I think we could have potentially some democrats in those states, for the massive tax cuts that we're talking about.

KILMEADE: So it's going to be a big week obviously, and there's certain things you zone in on, and every President's got his preference, some (inaudible) foreign policy. I think you love the numbers, the budget, and the economy. But I've got ask you something the big picture -

TRUMP: I think foreign policy for me has been very strong. I think we did the right thing with Iran, and if you notice, Iran was respectful yesterday. They were not jumping up and down, they were respectful of what I did. And they may not agree with it, but they were very respectful. I think that if you look at what I did with the payments going to the insurance companies, not going to poor people, they're going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I bought a list for you...

KILMEADE: You did. For me?

TRUMP: Look at these -- look at these insurance companies. This is since Obamacare started. Anthem, big company, 270 percent increase. 270 percent. And that's since ACA, that's Obamacare. So since Obamacare, Humana, 420 percent increase. Aetna, 470 percent increase. Cigna, 480 percent increase.

KILMEADE: So I looked at those numbers...

TRUMP: Insurance companies are making a fortune.

KILMEADE: So are you saying when you - when they raise premiums, or raise deductibles, they're trying to increase their profits instead of doing an honest job about giving people insurance? Are they being dishonest in going too profit-oriented?

TRUMP: No, they got a great deal with Obamacare. The one beneficiary, the great beneficiaries for Obamacare is not the people. They're getting killed. And look at what's happening to their premiums, look at what's happening to their deductibles, how high their deductibles. But look, these are - these are not made up by me. When you have Cigna, Aetna, Humana, Anthem going up 270, 420, 470 percent, 480 percent, these are insurance companies that went up 480 percent since Obamacare. Is any stock on the stock exchange - has anybody gone up that much?

KILMEADE: You would know better than me.

TRUMP: The reason is - the reason is, it's because Obamacare is a rip-off. It's great for the insurance companies. And find out who gave all that money to the Democrats. Take a look at the insurance companies.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: So the Democrats don't want to hurt the insurance companies. So the money I took away was taken away by - from the insurance companies. And by the way, since I took it down, you saw what happened to their stocks.

KILMEADE: Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are working on a bipartisan plan. They stopped when it looked as though Lindsey Graham and Cassidy had something going. Is this to force their hand to come up with something?

TRUMP: Well, this helps, because nobody knows (ph)...

KILMEADE: No, not so much this paper, but so much the $7 billion, "I'm not making that payment." Does that help...

TRUMP: Yeah, I think it helps. I think it helps to make a deal...

KILMEADE: So you did it to push action?

TRUMP: I think if I did not do that, if I didn't hold it back - and I just said we're not going to make that payment. If I didn't do that, I don't believe the Democrats would have called.

KILMEADE: David Axelrod said last night that you're pulling this back and (inaudible) tearing up the Iran deal is your attempt to obliterate the Obama legacy. Is it?

TRUMP: No, it's just that I disagree with Obama on so many things. I mean, I heard - as an example, let's say, Hilary Clinton said it was OK for the NFL players to kneel during the anthem. Well, I disagree. Maybe that's why she lost, because that's bad. That's real bad. We have to respect our flag, our country, our anthem. Obama, I disagree with what he does. Look, when you look at this - nobody knows this. I just got these numbers. Nobody knows this about the insurance companies. The only beneficiary from Obamacare are the insurance companies. They made a fortune. And that's not - you've never heard that, you've never seen these numbers before.

KILMEADE: I haven't. And that's why you handed it to me ahead of time, gave me a little bit of time to study. So some other news that broke today and you tweeted out, Congressman Marino was pulled back as drug czar. What went into that?

TRUMP: Yeah, well he's a fine man. He was a supporter of mine from Pennsylvania. Great state, I won Pennsylvania. And he's a Congressman from Pennsylvania, very popular. And he told me, look, if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest with insurance companies, essentially - but if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest, he doesn't want anything to do with it. So whether we have insurance companies or drug companies - and there was a couple of articles having to do with him and drug companies. And I will tell you, he felt compelled - he feels very strong about the opioid problem and the drug problem, which is a worldwide problem. It's a problem that we have. And Tom Marino said "Look, I'll take a pass. I have no choice. I really will take a pass, I want to do it." And he was very gracious, I have to say that.

KILMEADE: Big exposé on 60 minutes.

TRUMP: He didn't want to have - he didn't want to have even the perception of a conflict of interest with drug companies or, frankly, insurance companies.

KILMEADE: New HHS secretary, I was talking to Kellyanne Conway today. It seems like you're close. Do you want to go over any names?

TRUMP: We are more than close, but I won't be able to tell you the name yet because we have to do a little vetting. But we are more than close and if this person gets approved it will be a fantastic, a fantastic nomination.

KILMEADE: You came out with Mitch McConnell yesterday and seemed on the same page and then said I'll take any questions. And, it was just a regular - it was like a press conference you'd see on a sporting event.

TRUMP: I only did that because you weren't in the audience.

KILMEADE: I know. Why is that?

TRUMP: If you were in the audience I wouldn't have done that.

KILMEADE: One of the questions was about writing the Green Berets soldiers and ends up being a bigger story. Can I ask you what you thought about when you brought up past presidents and what they've done? Do you want to clarify anything?

TRUMP: Well, there's nothing to clarify because if you look at my whole (ph) this was again fake news CNN. I mean, they're just a bunch of fakers. So, they asked me that questions and for the most part to the best of my knowledge I think I've called every family of somebody that's died and it's the hardest call to make. And I said it very loud and clear yesterday. The hardest thing for me to do is do that. Now, as far as other representatives, I don't know. I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama. You could ask other people, I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters and I also call.

Now, sometimes if you had a tragic event with - it's very difficult to be able to do that. But I have called, I believe everybody but certainly I'll use the word virtually everybody where during the last nine months something's happened to us all. I've called virtually everybody. I've gone to Dover. I've seen what takes place at Dover.

It's an incredible scene and very, very sad. One of the saddest things you'll ever see. But I really speak for myself. I'm not speaking for other people. I don't know what Bush did, I don't know what Obama did. You could find out easily what President Obama did. All you have to do is ask the military people but I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy.

I can tell you my policy is I've called every one of them. And, you have to let a little time go by. You can't just call immediately but I will be calling, have called and will be calling the parents and the loved ones, wives, et cetera of the soldiers that recently were killed.

KILMEADE: No, I meant seeing (ph) you happy?

TRUMP: I love doing it. I'm getting tremendous support even in your polls I'm getting tremendous support and it's hard to believe I can get support when you have so many phony stories out there. Like, CNN, like MSNBC, like NBC. NBC is probably worse than CNN. But all I know is FOX is good. FOX, we love you, FOX.

KILMEADE: We're fair.

TRUMP: You are fair.

KILMEADE: Thank you.

TRUMP: You know what, the truth is you hit me when it's needed. You do. I mean, you do in particular.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: But the fact is -

KILMEADE: I think we're fair.

TRUMP: All I want is fair. I don't want anything else. I just want fair. And FOX has really been fair and I appreciate it.

KILMEADE: Thank you. I appreciate the time you gave us and the Brian Kilmeade Show.

TRUMP: Thank you.

KILMEADE: And this morning. And, thanks for having us out here.

TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. Take care of yourself.

KILMEADE: Thank you, Mr. President. All right. So, we're here in the Eisenhower Building and the president actually gave us my own (ph) notes for the interview so that's great. There he is. Thanks for listening. Keep it here. I'm Brian Kilmeade.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.

A knife-wielding man killed a 50-year-old woman and stabbed seven other people at a shopping mall in southeastern Poland on Friday, officials said.

A police spokesman said a 27-year-old resident of the town began stabbing people at random inside the VIVO shopping mall in the town of Stalowa Wola.

The motive for the attack was not immediately clear.

Andrzej Wierszyna told reporters the man, who was detained soon after the attack, had a sharp tool with him. The object was later identified as a knife.

Witnesses said several shoppers and a bodyguard attempted to catch the suspect after he started “blindly” stabbing people, the Mirror reported.

The attacker – named only as Konrad K – was eventually tackled to the ground by a shopper before police arrived.

One woman who was attacked died later at a hospital, said Anna Klee, the regional police spokeswoman in Rzeszow.

"He was attacking people from behind, hitting them with the knife," Klee told PAP news agency.

A breathalyzer test revealed the man was not under the influence of alcohol when the attack occurred, the Daily Mail reported.

The victims were taken to hospitals in Stalowa Wola, Tarnobrzeg and Sandomierz, most with serious wounds, Wierszyna said.

Editor's note: The following column first appeared in The Washington Times.

As we’ve all been understandably focused on Hollywood’s Weinstein dumpster fire, a number of stories have emerged exposing the left’s continuing culture war, despite its meltdown in the film industry. The Harvey Weinstein saga is but one symptom of a dangerous and destructive, yet smug and sanctimonious, liberal establishment. While they butcher American culture, civil society and history, how better to keep us normals from interfering than by blaming their victims for society’s ills?

Cases in point from the last week, reminding us there are many fronts in our fight to save this nation from the bullies of the pompous left:

Dr. Pamela Gaudry was a passenger on a Delta flight that also carried one of our fallen soldiers. Upon landing, the captain announced that the body of Army Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, who was killed on Oct. 4 in Niger, was on board and asked everyone to stay seated.

Before Debbe Dunning was cast as Heidi, the vivacious and funny "Tool Time" girl on the hit sitcom "Home Improvement," the California native was hitting the beauty pageant circuit to land her big break.

"I did a lot of bikini contests, I did a lot of beauty pageants," Dunning told Fox News. "It got me where I am."

Dunning, who was crowned Miss Burbank in 1984, said she "joined every beauty pageant I could find" because she "had no idea how to break into the business."

While Dunning said she was willing to do whatever it took to break into Hollywood, there was one opportunity she turned down: Playboy.

PHOTOS: Cast of 'Home Improvement' then and now

"I wasn't ready to be naked in front of my dad and his friends and the rest of the world but especially my family," she told us. "[Maybe] it's great for some people but I don't want to be sitting in a room and see someone across from me that's seen me completely exposed. That never really sat comfortable with me, so I never did nudes."

Dunning's success in pageants lead her to landing roles in commercials and eventually to her role on the Tim Allen sitcom "Home Improvement."

"I love 'Home Improvement.' I loved everybody on the show," she said. "It's one of those shows where you go to work [and] couldn't wait to get there. And when you leave, you're driving home, laughing the whole time, make your dinner, you go to bed and you get excited [to go back to work]... It was one of those jobs where I couldn't wait to be there so absolutely, I'd love to do it again."

She later added, "We ended too early."

While the mom-of-three is open to a "Home Improvement" reboot, she is busy hosting her new show "Debbe Dunning's Dude Ranch Roundup."

"It's not just riding horses," she told us. "It's fly fishing, it's skeet shooting, white water rafting, I mean, you name it."

Traveling across the country visiting dude ranch to dude ranch gave the 51-year-old a new perspective on why she's proud to be an American.

"I feel so blessed that we live in a place where there are people brave enough to stand up on that line for us and give their life if they have to," she said. "To continue the freedom that we live and we get get to basically experience every day."

She added, "I will always stand for the United States."

"I'm a rock star now." That's how a Florida Democrat has reacted to her recent notoriety after becoming tangled in a controversy over her account of President Donald Trump's condolence phone call to a U.S. Army widow.

"You mean to tell me that I've become so important that the White House is following me and my words?" U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson asked reporters Thursday.

"This is amazing. That's amazing. I'll have to tell my kids that I'm a rock star now."

Later Thursday, President Trump accused Wilson of lying in her account of the phone call between Trump and the widow of a U.S. service member who was recently killed in Africa.

The same tweet also asserts that news organizations have been “going crazy” with U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson’s version of the story.

“The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!”

The president’s tweet came hours after Chief of Staff John Kelly made an emotional speech at the White House, saying he was “stunned” to learn that Wilson had been listening in when the president spoke with Myeshia Johnson, widow of U.S. Army Sgt. La David Johnson -- one of four American soldiers killed in Niger nearly two weeks ago.

Wilson, a Democrat, was with Johnson's family when Trump called to offer condolences. The congresswoman said Trump had told the widow that "you know that this could happen when you signed up for it ... but it still hurts."

Johnson's aunt said Trump showed "disrespect" to the soldier's loved ones.

Wilson on Thursday said Trump disrespected Johnson’s widow with his comments during the phone call.

In comments to the White House press corps, Kelly defended Trump and said he was "stunned" by the criticism of Trump's condolence call to the sergeant's family. Kelly accused Wilson of "selfish behavior."

Kelly also told reporters that the president had expressed his condolences "in the best way that he could."

Wilson gave a cryptic response when Miami television station WSVN-TV caught up with her Thursday, repeating a phrase she said her mother told her when she was a child. Wilson said: "The dog can bark at the moon all night long but it doesn't become an issue until the moon barks back."

"[B]lood will be on their hands."

That's what Sean Penn’s lawyers are saying about Netflix in regards to their release of a documentary series about drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman which, they warn, could put the Academy Award-winning actor in danger.

Theordore J. Boutrous Jr., Penn’s lawyer, wrote a letter to Netflix explaining the release of “The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story” could potentially put Penn in danger because the series implied the actor helped the Department of Justice apprehend the notorious head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, The New York Times reported.

Boutrous told the streaming service in the letter “blood will be on their hands if this film causes bodily harm.”

SEAN PENN TELLS CHARLIE ROSE HE REGRETS EL CHAPO INTERVIEW

The series, which was released Friday, focused on del Castillo, a Mexican actress, and Penn’s October 2015 meeting with Guzman. Penn wrote an article for the Rolling Stone detailing the interview that was facilitated by del Castillo. The essay was published a day after the drug lord was recaptured in Mexico. Penn claimed he had nothing to do with Guzman’s recapture.

Last year, Penn told Charlie Rose that he met the drug lord in a “place nowhere near where he was captured.” He also told Rose the accusations that he helped in Guzman's capture were “incorrect and could put him in danger.”

“It is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish and reckless narrative,” Penn’s spokesman told The New York Times.

COULD SEAN PENN’S ‘EL CHAPO’ INTERVIEW MEAN TROUBLE FOR THE ACTOR?

“The notion that Mr. Penn or anyone on his behalf alerted DOJ (Department of Justice) to the trip is a complete fabrication and boldfaced lie. It never happened, nor would there have been any reason for it to have happened.”

Netflix responded that Penn was “given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate” in the interview but did not. Netflix reiterated the documentary does not reveal any new information but gave del Castillo her chance to tell her side of the story.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Is China’s president, Xi Jinping, preparing to transfer his enormous powers to a younger generation of leaders? Or is he quietly ensuring that no one will ever be able to dislodge him as he goes about his plan to make China the most important nation on earth? Judging from his recent actions, the answer is: both.

Xi is presiding this week over the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the unchallenged power in the world’s most populous country. During a 3 ½-hour keynote speech, Xi laid out a plan to make China – and the majority of China’s 1.4 billion people – prosperous by 2050. If that timeline seems to stretch far into the future, it might be because the 64-year-old Xi expects to still be in charge then.

Since assuming office in 2013, Xi has created a cult of personality around himself like no Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. State television ran a week-long homage to him earlier this year. Newspaper headlines extol his virtues. And when he stepped to the podium to deliver his speech, the 2,338 Party delegates leapt to their feet as if their chairs were electrified.

“He has accumulated more power than anyone in China since Deng Xioping,” says Sourabh Gupta, Senior Fellow at Institute of China–America Studies in Washington D.C. Deng led the communist party from 1978 until he technically stepped aside in 1989, though he remained the most powerful man in China nearly until his death in 1997. He is widely credited with converting China from an agrarian economy into a manufacturing superpower.

“This is not Chinese glasnost,” says Gupta, referring to the efforts of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to govern more openly. “Under Xi, there has been a widespread crackdown on individual liberties and political challenges are not tolerated. He’s almost like an emperor.”

Xi wants nothing less than to make China the new center of the world economy, displacing the United States. He calls his master plan “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which might sound vague to Western ears, but which his countrymen understand as a better standard of living for regular Chinese, while maintaining the party’s absolute power over all aspects of their lives.

“This is not Chinese glasnost,” says Gupta, referring to the efforts of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to govern more openly. “Under Xi, there has been a widespread crackdown on individual liberties and political challenges are not tolerated. He’s almost like an emperor.”

It is an unwritten rule that the party’s secretary general give way to someone younger when he (there have been no women leaders) reaches the age of 68. Xi shows no signs of slowing down. He will, however, install some loyal lieutenants to ensure his vision is carried out. One name to watch is Hu Chunhua, 54, the party chief of Guangdong province. He’s a loyalist and, if and when Xi decides to retire, could be China’s next leader.

For baseball fans, Xi’s at bat. But Hu’s on first.

Before Glenn Close became a Hollywood star, she spent 15 years as a member of a religious cult known as the Moral Re-Armament (MRA). But the 70-year-old insists her traumatic childhood helped her become a better parent to 29-year-old Annie Maude Starke.

“You’re totally pulled up from what your roots were, what you love, and your family is pulled apart,” Close recalled to Closer Weekly Thursday. “It was very destructive.”

Close said her controversial past has made her determined to give her daughter a stable and loving upbringing.

“She’s wonderful and makes me incredibly proud,” explained Close. “I’m also proud that I have a great friendship with her father [producer John H. Starke], and when she turned seven she was living in the same house that she was taken home to when she was born, and we still have that house.”

A post shared by All I Love (@pwm_allilove) on Oct 7, 2017 at 7:52pm PDT

Back in 2014, Close told The Hollywood Reporter she was just 7-years-old when her father, a Harvard-educated doctor, joined MRA, a group founded during the late 1930s. The publication added it was led by Rev. Frank Buchman, who was recognized as a “violently anti-intellectual and possibly homophobic evangelical fundamentalist.”

“You basically weren’t allowed to do anything, or you were made to feel guilty about any unnatural desire,” said Close at the time. “If you talk to anybody who was in a group that basically dictates how you’re supposed to live and what you’re supposed to say and how you’re supposed to feel, from the time you’re 7 till the time you’re 22, it has a profound impact on you. It’s something you have to [consciously overcome] because all of your trigger points are [wrong].”

Close wouldn’t reveal how she manage to leave MRA at age 22, but she did share how her memories impacted her over the years.

A post shared by Glenn Close Fans (@glennclosenews) on Aug 15, 2017 at 9:06pm PDT

“I would have dreams because I didn’t go to any psychiatrist or anything,” she said. “I had these dreams, and they started with betrayal, a sense of betrayal, and then they developed into me being able to look at these people and say, ‘You’re wrong. You’re wrong.’ And then the final incarnation of those dreams was my being able to calmly get up and walk away. And then I didn’t have them anymore.”

Do the leaders of the Boy Scouts of America understand the first word of their organization’s name?

With its recent announcement that it will admit girls, the Boy Scouts organization has not simply shown a profound disregard for its admirable roots. It has further abandoned boys to a culture that values them less and less.

Dressed in the language of equality and fairness, the move by the Boy Scouts may seem harmless enough. But I believe it’s unhelpful at best and damaging at worst – to both boys and girls.

However much some may wish it were otherwise, the reality is that males and females are fundamentally different in many ways – physically, emotionally and in their relationships. Pretending otherwise in the name of progress or permissiveness might be culturally acceptable, but it does both sexes a disservice.

Sadly, the Boy Scouts appear to have bought into the idea that rather than being something to be celebrated and championed, boyhood is something to be watered down.

One of those differences, in most cases, is the way boys and girls learn. Girls are more likely to do well in the quiet control of a classroom, while boys squirm and struggle.

Daring, action and competition – potential strengths that rival focus, reflection, and consensus – are qualities that need to be fostered and filtered. Boys know that rough-and-tumble play – like playing with squirt guns and laser tag – does just that. Restrictions on this are alienating and downplay the natural tendencies of boys.

Boys need strong male role models. They also need a place for adventure and opportunities to test themselves in pursuit of awards that challenge and channel their innate drive and daring. In this way they can be helped to grow into men of true strength, real character, and genuine conviction – not Hollywood’s distorted version of manhood.

Sadly, the Boy Scouts appear to have bought into the idea that rather than being something to be celebrated and championed, boyhood is something to be watered down. They are discounting a historically male-focused experience that made presidents, astronauts and leaders of mere men. Indeed, making the inclusivity announcement on the International Day of the Girl Child could be considered the ultimate put-down.

Indeed, I believe one of the main reasons we see the sort of indefensible behavior by men in power – like the actions Harvey Weinstein is accused of – is a lack of the kind of mentoring and coaching that models true manhood.

Don’t misunderstand: I’m not inferring that girls are lesser or inferior. The Boy Scouts message is actually that boys are lesser and inferior because their uniqueness needs to be denied rather than directed, stifled rather than strengthened.

While I’m clarifying something, let me also emphasize that my conviction that we must provide space for “boys to be boys” does not mean I’m advocating a breeding ground for a future generation of sexual predators.

Indeed, I believe one of the main reasons we see the sort of indefensible behavior by men in power – like the actions Harvey Weinstein is accused of – is a lack of the kind of mentoring and coaching that models true manhood.

I’m talking about instilling in today’s boys a culture of respect, honor and integrity. Properly guided, the drive and daring tendencies in boys will lead them to become the determined, focused, winning men of tomorrow who appreciate the uniqueness and dignity of women.

You don’t have to look too far to see that at every level of society we are losing ground in areas as basic as kindness, self-control, respect, honor and purity. These should be taught and modeled for boys in an atmosphere designed for their unique temperament under the tutelage of men with the mettle to guide, alongside their peers.

Robert Baden-Powell would not now recognize the organization he founded in 1910. But while the Boy Scouts may have lost their way, they are not alone. They are just another group favoring trendy political correctness over time-honored principled convictions.

The results of all this are sadly too evident when it comes to our sons. Boys are losing out in any number of categories, from heightened special education involvement and ADHD diagnoses to lower high school rankings and college attendance.

While my dismay at the Boy Scouts decision centers on what this means for boys, I am also concerned about its impact on girls. What’s bad for the gander is equally bad for the goose.

Girls, though wired differently, equally need an environment that caters to their unique traits and qualities. You can’t deliver a program at a character-changing level with any real effectiveness in the same style to two different types of learners.

As Baden-Powell observed: “Girls should … take a real and not a visionary share in the welfare of the nation.”

But they shouldn’t be squeezed into a Boy Scout uniform.

One size does not fit all.

The student told deputies form the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office she and the Truman had sex “multiple times” in the high school from March to May 2016, WFTV reported.

A report was filed on Oct. 4 and Truman was placed on leave from Lake Howell High, where she was then teaching, after Child Protective Services called the school, WFTV reported.

The educator resigned from her position at the school Thursday and turned herself in to police the same day, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Officials said Truman was cooperating with the investigation.

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.

On Thursday, Business Insider released the results of a joint study with Foursquare that aimed to determine each state’s favorite fast food restaurant, using data obtained from Foursquare check-ins.

There’s just one problem: Plenty of fast-food fans aren’t buying it.

According to the results of the study, Chick-fil-A was found to be the favorite restaurant chain in a total of 39 states, as illustrated in this heavily maroon-tinged map first shared by Business Insider:

“For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” wrote Business Insider, who added that “Chick-fil-A dominates — which isn’t surprising.”

CHICK-FIL-A TESTING NEW 'SPICY' OFFERINGS AT SELECT LOCATIONS

Twitter users were quick to refute the study’s findings, however, arguing that the results don’t actually reflect what people in any given state prefer, and calling the study “nonsense.”

Some also claimed that, in states where Chick-fil-A wasn’t the winner, the restaurants were determined to be a state’s “favorite” weren’t even all that popular.

Media outlets like the Oregonian and the SFGate, too, were unconvinced by the results, with the Oregonian calling them "inconceivably bad" and SFGate saying they've "got issues" with Cane's as California's top choice.

The SFGate also reported that Business Insider removed a Twitter post featuring the map from its timeline.

But no matter what Foursquare or Twitter has to say, the results of a 2017 report from the American Consumer Satisfaction Index suggest that Chick-fil-A is, in actuality, America’s favorite fast food restaurant. According to its survey, Chick-fil-A was ranked as the top fast food restaurant for a third year in a row in terms of customer satisfaction, scoring 87 out of a possible 100 points on the ACSI’s annual index.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Sheriff's deputies conducting a child porn raid on a Florida home on Wednesday found an arsenal of guns and explosives and a homemade silencer, along with a note promising "bloody revenge."

Investigators found the weapons — including an AK-47 assault rifle, a 50-caliber pistol, a baseball bat with nails jutting out and 2,300 rounds of ammunition — in a locked closet in the Dunedin, Florida, home where 24-year-old Randall Drake lived with his parents, said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri.

During a news conference on Thursday night, Gaultieri said that even more "troubling" is that investigators found aerial images of two schools and a water treatment plant in nearby Tampa. There was also the note written by Drake that promised he'll have his "bloody revenge" and "the world will burn burn."

"I don't know what his plan was," the sheriff said. "He had all kinds of books and all kinds of gun powder and if he had taken those devices put them in something else and put a bunch of nails and screws and other things, he could have caused some serious damage. Because it's the shrapnel that hurts and kills everybody."

The sheriff said he notified law enforcement and school officials in Hillsborough County, but so far investigators believe Drake was working alone.

His parents told authorities they didn't know what he kept in his locked closet, the sheriff said. Drake had no criminal history. He was fired in 2015 from Florida Firearm Academy in New Port Richey after he came to work with guns strapped to his thighs, officials said. He also was an Explorer with the Tampa Police Department when he was younger.

Drake's parents told deputies he was homeschooled.

Gualtieri compared Drake to Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock in the way he seemed to be acting alone.

"These are the people who are most concerning to us," he said. "What we call the lone wolves, the sleepers who are out there, the people who are not on our radar, the people who have fallen under the radar or off of it. You don't know about them until they engage in devastating acts and kill a whole bunch of people."

The note deputies found in Drake's bedroom read: "My fury at those who imprisoned me shall be vast and without mercy. I shall have my bloody revenge, and then the world will burn burn."

The child porn investigation that led to the search warrant this week began in January, the sheriff said.

Drake faces felony charges of possessing destructive devices. He left jail on a $20,000 bond, but an attorney isn't listed on jail records.

Starbucks has come under fire for their not-so-festive holiday cups in the past, but this year they appear to be going all-out.

Earlier this week, a Reddit user by the name of DarthSpoopy shared a photo of what was allegedly Starbucks’ brand new holiday cups for 2017. The post was removed from Reddit shortly afterward, but not before fans and news outlets were able to capture screengrabs:

“Just got it in our order,” the user wrote at the top of his Reddit post. “Holiday cup short design!??”

IS STARBUCKS RELEASING A 'ZOMBIE FRAPPUCCINO'?

The cups in the photo — or the short ones, at least — feature the Starbucks logo surrounded by red and green holiday-themed doodles. Included among the artwork are doves, hearts, snowflakes, a Christmas tree, a stack of presents, and, oddly, what appear to be two of the old Starbucks holiday cups from years’ past.

It’s still unclear how the Redditor obtained a photo of these cups in the first place, though the caption suggests that he/she works at a Starbucks.

Christian groups, in particular, began claiming the company was trying to remove all references to Christmas from the cups. On group called it a “war on Christmas,” while another evangelist in Arizona said Starbucks had “removed Christmas” from its cups because “they hate Jesus.”

Occasionally you know that you are watching history being made. October 5, 2017 was such a day for me.

On that day, Vice President Mike Pence stood before the space shuttle Discovery and called to order the first meeting of the renewed National Space Council. Historians of tomorrow will regard the meeting at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center as the beginning of America’s return as the leader in mankind’s race to explore outer space.

The meeting was of course historic in the literal sense. This was the Space Council’s first meeting in nearly 25 years, since the Clinton Administration disbanded it in 1993.

But this month’s meeting was especially significant for another reason. It signaled a serious change in the way the United States approaches and interacts with space. In addition to attendees from government agencies such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and others, the room at was filled with key people from private enterprise who are currently working to break out and lead the world in space activity.

During the council meeting, Ozmen described a future where you could travel anywhere on the globe in 45 minutes or less.

The council heard from leaders at Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, both of which are pioneering reusable rocket technology that will help greatly reduce the cost of getting into outer space.

Fatih Ozmen, the CEO of Sierra Nevada Corporation, spoke about his company’s Dream Chaser space vehicle, which is designed to launch from a rocket, perform a mission in space, then return and land on any runway that can accommodate a large passenger airplane. The vehicle can be used more than 15 times, which represents a huge step forward for regular space flight, space tourism, and potentially high-speed travel here on earth. During the council meeting, Ozmen described a future where you could travel anywhere on the globe in 45 minutes or less.

The private sector’s investment in space is extremely important. Private innovation will help launch us out of the old, government bureaucracy-led model, which has become inundated with red tape, risk aversion and politics, and into a more dynamic era that’s driven by competition, technology, and enterprise.

From his chairman’s seat on the National Space Council, Vice President Pence has the opportunity to help unlock NASA, reform decades-old flight regulations, and make it possible for the private industry to achieve breakthroughs that will fundamentally change life on earth.

I am especially excited about Vice President Pence’s recognition that it is important to put Americans back on the Moon – and that going to the Moon is about more than just landing there. He said, “We will return American astronauts to the Moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond.”

The Vice President correctly described the Moon as “a stepping stone” for America to reach the real potential of space. In addition to going to Mars, that potential includes asteroid mining, zero-gravity manufacturing, deep space travel, advances in propulsion systems, and other breakthroughs which could propel human beings into a wide-open future.

During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump pledged that America would once again look to the stars and “unlock the mysteries of space.” This first meeting of the National Space Council was an important step to accomplishing the President’s goals.

The council’s next job will be to fully analyze our current policies on space and make recommendations to President Trump on how to move forward. Based on what I saw earlier this month, America will soon be leading the world in space travel – and inspiring a new generation of Americans to explore the stars.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The Senate has passed its version of the annual budget resolution, which would permit a simple majority to pass a 10-year tax cut of $1.5 trillion. That’s a modest amount – only about three-quarters of 1 percent of our nation’s gross domestic product. But it will prove a heavy lift for Congress to pass because of concerns about multibillion-dollar budget deficits.

Factoring in some revenue gains from increased economic growth, the tax cut that would be permitted in the budget resolution would increase the U.S. budget deficit by no more than one-fifth – likely much less. The basic problem is that tax cuts can’t go farther, owing to legitimate worries about budget deficits. Entitlements are on track to exceed 100 percent of federal revenue within a decade, forcing the government to borrow just to fund day-to-day operations.

The GOP majority in Congress – especially senators like Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski from entitlement-dependent states like Maine, West Virginia and Alaska – refuses to tackle entitlement abuse, putting the borrowing capacity of the U.S. Treasury near its limit.

Consequently, tax cuts are expected to be limited to about $150 billion a year – approximately divided between corporate and personal tax relief, including ending the estate tax, which garners about $17 billion a year. That is not nearly enough money to soothe those whose oxen would be gored by efforts to simplify America’s painfully complex tax code.

Such reforms require eliminating cherished deductions, like those for state and local taxes or domestic manufacturing, to make possible lower rates overall. Keeping the exercise revenue-neutral would create about as many losers as winners. For example, eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes would benefit individuals in low-tax states like Florida and Texas, but raise taxes paid by those in high-tax states likes New York and California.

To make tax simplification politically palatable, the overall revenue take must be reduced more significantly to lower rates more dramatically, or the losers will apply pressure on Congress to kill the reforms. Spreading around $150 billion in additional rate reductions – less $17 billion to axe the estate tax – is not nearly enough.

For example, the deduction for medical expenses exceeding 10 percent of income is likely to be eliminated, and the elderly suffering from Alzheimer’s and other expensive to treat chronic illnesses could face hefty tax increases.

On the business side, cutting the federal tax rate from 35 to 20 percent appears to be a big tax reduction and for many it will be. But eliminating or curtailing interest deductions and special benefits for manufacturers will likely leave many credit-dependent businesses that sell products competing with Chinese imports more disadvantaged than before.

Overall, what matters are the actual taxes paid, and slicing $75 billion off the annual federal corporate taxes would reduce the effective rate by about only one-fifth. Studies by European Union and other tax experts indicate that would still leave U.S. effective tax rates significantly higher than those in other industrialized countries.

Significant incentives would remain for pharmaceutical companies and other businesses earning substantial patent income to flee to Ireland by changing the nationality of their corporate registration via so-called tax inversions.

In fact, by moving to a territorial system – namely taxing the profits earned by U.S. companies on the basis of where those are earned – a significant tax avoidance business could emerge from simply moving research and development activities to locations like Ireland and domiciling patent ownership there if companies can get enough scientists to move.

For many companies, the tax plan would still make it more attractive to locate production and jobs in the United States. That should boost growth a few tenths of a percentage point. However, given the negatives mentioned above, Trump administration claims that the tax cuts would pay for themselves with more private investment and stronger growth are straight out of Alice in Wonderland.

The same goes for tax simplification. The administration proposes to apply a special 25 percent personal rate to limited liability companies (LLCs). For example, the rate would apply to architectural and construction firms organized as LLCs that put up shopping malls and apartment buildings – but not to independent architects and engineers who do smaller projects by subcontracting with various specialty companies.

The same goes for the large real estate holding companies with multiple LLCs for individual properties – but not the home-based real estate investor with 10 units, or the individual who loses his job and creates employment for himself and vendors by setting up a home-based consultancy.

Somehow it would seem that big LLCs – such as JP Morgan Securities or Koch Industries – create jobs, but many smaller businesses are viewed as parasites to be taxed excessively.

And for the latter, the IRS compliance and enforcement apparatus will add a new level of complexity and harassment.

All of this can be accommodated in the inevitable negotiations and compromising that will follow the Trump administration’s initial proposals, but realism must prevail.

Only so much tax relief and simplification can be squeezed out of $150 billion a year.

Las Vegas shooting details still murky as Mandalay Bay ordered to keep evidence

What happened in Vegas seems to be staying in Vegas.

Nearly three weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the release of details surrounding the horrific attack has slowed from a trickle to a standstill: police have yet to schedule another news conference, confusion continues to surround the gunman's motive and critical questions linger about what exactly happened on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

The president of the union representing Jesus Campos – a security officer at the hotel who was shot during the attack and who became the subject of intense public interest after bailing on scheduled TV interviews last week – also told Fox News he has “no idea” whether or not Campos will return to work at Mandalay Bay.

And inside and outside the opulent resort and casino, the crime scene remained frozen in time Friday, as the Las Vegas enterprise was ordered by a judge to not destroy anything that could be considered evidence in a trial -- right down to the broken glass from gunman Stephen Paddock’s suite.

“What our client is saying and what the community and the nation is saying is shifting timelines, witnesses missing...it just creates this general sense of unease, people just don’t feel safe,” attorney Brian Nettles, who is representing shooting victim Rachel Sheppard, told KSNV.

The preservation order from Judge Mark Denton, which was issued Thursday, blocks Mandalay Bay from erasing video surveillance, card swipe data and complaints coming from Paddock’s hotel suite – among other items – until another hearing on Oct. 30 where MGM Resorts International will have a chance to argue against it.

“This was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. We have no intention of renting that room,” the company said in a statement following the order. “We’ve been cooperating with law enforcement from the moment this happened, which includes preserving evidence.”

COUNTRY MUSIC STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CONCERTS

Opposite Mandalay Bay, pictures of the festival grounds taken by KSNV this week show little has changed since the Oct. 1 attack, where 58 people attending a country music concert were gunned down by Paddock from his room. Nearly 500 others were wounded.

“This weekend!” reads a billboard on the festival grounds, surrounded by fences and yellow crime scene tape. Across the street, a black #VegasStrong banner is hanging from the top of the Mandalay Bay resort -- its golden facade glimmering in the sunlight -- with the two boarded up windows Paddock took aim from noticeably standing out.

Campos, who was shot in the leg by Paddock while investigating an alarm on his floor, appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' show this week alongside Stephen Schuck, a hotel maintenance worker who credits Campos for saving his life.

But the host did little to clear up the plethora of unanswered questions about Paddock and response to the shooting, including what caused Paddock to stop firing before authorities ever gained entry to his room, where Paddock was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“If you watch the entire show, the venue is not where I would have put these two heroes to tell their story,” David Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, told Fox News. “I’m not criticizing Mr. Campos and his decision, since he has been through a horrendous event, but what I was saying is it’s not the venue I would have chosen or recommended.”

Hickey said he and Campos met with MGM’s corporate team last week before a series of scheduled television interviews, including one with Fox News' Sean Hannity, which the security officer had agreed to do.

“They said they were concerned about pressure that would be put on Mr. Campos by someone like Sean Hannity,” Hickey told Fox News.

FULL COVERAGE OF LAS VEGAS SHOOTING

He added the casino giant’s executives cited worries about Campos' “health” and expressed concern about the “stress” of appearing on five shows.

“I felt like this was a time that Mr. Campos should be made comfortable and confident to do something he had never done before, to speak on air and to do it live,” Hickey said.

The meeting ended with Campos slipping out while Hickey was in another room and disappearing from the public spotlight for days. Campos resurfaced on television Wednesday for the pre-recorded interview, despite saying last week that he wanted to tell his story and move on, Hickey said.

The union president said the “officers at Mandalay Bay,” such as Campos, are the ones who haven’t been recognized enough in the wake of the attack.

“You can’t work an emergency situation like that and not be under a great deal of stress,” he said.

It’s been 43 years since the western drama “Little House on the Prairie” made its grand debut on television – and its stars still insist they’re like family.

The series, which starred Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert, among others, ran until 1983.

“There was no real cast drama because Michael [Landon] would not allow it,” said Alison Arngrim, who played “nasty Nellie,” to Closer Weekly Friday. “I think we are the only cast that never had any arrests!”

The 55-year-old also added, “[Michael] knew exactly what he wanted with every shot and every scene.”

A post shared by @murielfoenkinos on Oct 16, 2017 at 4:37am PDT

Landon’s widow Cindy confirmed the claim.

“If you watch ‘Little House,’ truly it was like watching Michael,” she said. “The love that he had for his family, the type of person he was – it was all apparent.”

Rachel Greenbush, who starred as Carrie Ingalls alongside twin sister Sidney, also had fond memories of working with Landon.

A post shared by @melissawithoutsueanderson on Oct 12, 2017 at 8:35am PDT

“For all the kids’ birthdays, he would have a cake made and throw a little party,” she recalled. “When it was time to work, you had to be focused.”

And while Landon expected hard work from everyone involved in the beloved show, he wasn’t afraid to get out of character to many anyone smile. Greenbush revealed he “was a big practical joker.”

“We used to go with Melissa [Gilbert] to catch frogs in the creek,” she said. “We would bring them back to Michael, and then he would put them in his mouth and walk up to people, open his mouth and the frog would jump out! People would freak out!”

But that wasn’t the only surprise the cast would encounter. The publication added that when production moved from Paramount Studios to MGM in the late ‘70s, they made an unlikely discovery.

“They were ripping up the floor of the set, and what Melissa [Gilbert] and I see, lying beneath, was the Yellow Brick Road [from the 1939 ‘Wizard of Oz’ set]!” said Arngrim. “Melissa and I went nuts. We were dancing around, singing the song, pretending to be Dorothy!”

“Little House on the Prairie” would go on to stay in the top 30 ratings for nearly its entire nine-year run. But when it finally came to an end, Landon was eager to go out with a bang.

“He literally strapped dynamite on all those buildings and blew them to smithereens in one take,” said Melissa Francis, who played Cassandra Cooper Ingalls.

Landon passed away in 1991 at age 54 from cancer of the liver and pancreas. Arngrim previously told Fox News that “Little House on the Prairie” is currently airing in 140 countries and has kept her busy traveling to make appearances, especially in France where the show has a cult following.

A post shared by 🌸Little house on the prairie🌸 (@_littlehousee_) on Jul 20, 2016 at 1:38pm PDT

“When the show first stopped back in the ‘80s, I and a lot of the other actors thought people would stop talking about it… [but] it began rerunning in all the other countries,” she explained. “It didn’t go away, it only escalated.

"I get recognized more now than I did when the show was running… There was a time in my 20s when I would say I didn’t want to be recognized as Nellie forever… but Nellie was a lot of fun to play… Indeed, I thought I’d be sick of it, but now, it just makes me smile.”

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

RELATED: Budget-Friendly Bathroom Sets for Guests

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

RELATED: Start With These Gorgeous Low-Maintenance Indoor Plants

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds. The darker the room, the less dirt your guests will see. The darkness will hide many of your sins.

North Korea’s nuclear tests are not only raising fears around the world, they are causing the peak under which the bombs are being detonated to suffer “tired mountain syndrome.”

Analysts are seeing signs that Mount Mantap, the 7,200-foot-high peak under which the tests are conducted, is suffering from the geologic malady, the Washington Post reported.

During a massive detonation that triggered a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, the mountain visibly shifted. Since then, the region, which is not known for natural seismic activity, has had three more quakes.

“What we are seeing from North Korea looks like some kind of stress in the ground,” said Paul G. Richards, a seismologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “In that part of the world, there were stresses in the ground, but the explosions have shaken them up.”

Chinese scientists have raised the alarm that additonal nuclear tests could cause Mount Mantap to collapse and release the radiation from the blast.

North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, all of them under Mount Mantap at a site known as the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility.

Using satellite images, intelligence analysts and experts keep tabs on movement at the three entrances to tunnels for signals that a test is imminent.

After the latest test, on Sept. 3, dictator Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime claimed it had set off a hydrogen bomb and that it had been a “perfect success.”

Analysis group 38 North published images that showed “more numerous and widespread” disturbances at the site of the test than before, the BBC reported.

38 North said the pictures showed landslides as well as numerous areas of gravel and stone fields that were “lofted” by the tremors.

Lofting occurs when shockwaves force material to be ejected from the ground, and the material falls back down in the same place.

On Friday morning, first lady Melania Trump will donate her inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

The gown, designed by French-American fashion designer Hervé Pierre, will be placed in the museum’s “First Ladies” exhibit alongside several others worn by first ladies throughout American history, including Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Jacqueline Kennedy and Martha Washington.

MICHELLE OBAMA, NOT MELANIA TRUMP, MAKES VANITY FAIR'S INTERNATIONAL BEST DRESSED LIST

Pierre, too, will reportedly be accompanying Trump to the Smithsonian on Friday morning, telling Women’s Wear Daily that he jumped at the chance.

“She asked me if I wanted to be her date, and I said, ‘Oh hell, yes,’” Pierre told WWD. “As a foreigner who became an American, to have your gown put in the Smithsonian Museum is a big huge honor. I got chills. I know how in the designer world, there are lots of big egos. I have always tried to manage my ego for many, many years. But in this case, there is nothing to be ashamed of — it’s a big ego thing. I’m really, really proud of it.”

IVANKA TRUMP SAYS SHE WENT THROUGH A 'PUNK PHASE' IN EARLY NINETIES

In a January interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Pierre said Trump herself contributed to the design of the white, off-the-shoulder dress, picking out a “beautiful six-ply silk” for the construction and specifying the shape of the neckline.



"The lines are as sleek as a paper cut; the curves of the skirt are fluid, yet the overall shape is sharp and intense,” he told the magazine. “For me it reflects her personality.”

According to the Smithsonian, the tradition of first ladies giving over their gowns began in 1912 with Helen Taft, who donated the white silk chiffon dress she wore to her husband’s 1909 inauguration.

The First Ladies exhibit now houses one article of clothing that “belonged to the first lady or the president’s official hostess” from every administration, though “not all are inaugural ball gowns,” the museum writes.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is asking her European Union partners for patience in discussing the bloc's future as she embarks on efforts to form a new government.

Germany's Sept. 24 election left the conservative Merkel trying to form a new, untried coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and traditionally left-leaning Greens.

Exploratory talks opened Wednesday and were stepping up Friday, with all potential partners getting together for the first time. Talks are scheduled through Nov. 2, but it's likely to be weeks or months before they conclude.

Merkel said in Brussels on Friday that talks will feature issues such as the eurozone's future.

She said "it's not yet foreseeable when I can present results, and we will need in the coming weeks respect for the formation of a government in Germany."

Trump cites terror as reason for increase in UK violence, as crime stats across Europe rise

Citing the rise of violent crime in the United Kingdom, President Trump on Friday urged Americans to stay vigilant on this side of the Atlantic as jihadis continue exporting terror to the West.

“Just out report: 'United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.' Not good, we must keep America safe!” Trump tweeted.

Trump's message comes a day after the UK's Office of National Statistics published new data showing a surge in violent crime, including knife attacks and sexual offenses, during the past 12 months.

As of the end of June, police in England and Wales registered 5.2 million offenses, a number that was up 13 percent over the previous 12 months, according to The Guardian.

While the increase has mostly been attributed to the jump in sex and knife crimes, Trump may have focused his comment on the “substantial increase” of attempted murders, which rose about 59 percent in the last year.

ONS said that rise is due largely to the London and Manchester terror attacks, where police recorded 294 attempted murder offenses.

“Today’s figures suggest that the police are dealing with growing volume of crime,” John Flatley, the head of crime stats at ONS, said in a Thursday statement. “While improvements made by police forces in recording crime are still a factor in the increase, we judge that there have been genuine increases in crime – particularly in some of the low incidence but more harmful categories.”

The ONS report is one of two official sources used to analyze trends in crime, the Press Association reported. The other is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which gave an estimated total of 10.5 million crimes in the same time frame as the ONS report.

Annual comparisons aren't available until January.

“The recent increases in recorded crime need to be seen in the context of the overall decline in the crime indicated by the Crime Survey of England and Wales,” Flatley said.

The trend of rising violent crime is not unique to the UK.

Across Europe, the total number of intentional homicides – which include deaths that are the result of a terror attack – was at 4,528, a 4.3 percent rise between 2014 and 2015. Updated figures are expected to be released next year.

In Germany, intelligence officials said in October the number of potential Islamic terrorists had risen to 1,870. The German BfV, the domestic security agency, defines these people as radical extremists it believes are willing and able to carry out an attack -- but who can’t be arrested because they haven't yet committed a crime, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.

Agency officials said, in addition to these potential attackers, they worry about an increasingly desperate ISIS terror group turning to radicalized children to carry out their attacks.

“We have to keep an eye on this risk and find a fitting concept to combat it,” BfV chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, said in a statement Thursday.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board

Over the past nine months, Donald Trump’s cage match with the Washington press corps has turned into an unedifying national spectacle. Too often, the serious business of the nation has been pushed aside so that the press and Mr. Trump could go tit for tat, like children on a schoolyard. On Thursday, an adult finally stepped into the room.

John Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff and a retired four-star general, addressed White House reporters on this week’s dispute between the press and the President. That is the controversy around Mr. Trump’s call to the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed during an ambush in Niger recently.

As anyone who follows media reports knows, the President’s call to this mother grew into a personal feud between Mr. Trump and a Democratic Congresswoman who disclosed what the President said. It then produced long newspaper reports examining the President’s relationship with every identifiable Gold Star family during his term.

It took awhile for Mr. Kelly to get around to talking about that phone call. Instead, he spent some time offering what we in journalism—or anyone purporting to be engaged in a serious line of work—would call context. Mr. Kelly described what happens when a U.S. soldier or Marine—“the best 1% this country produces”—gets killed in action. What he described was a military process that is graphic, emotionally intense and, most of all, untouchable.

Untouchable, as Mr. Kelly made clear, in the sense that what has happened is so grave, so personal and so difficult that the reality of pushing through it comes down to an encounter between the fallen soldier’s family, the officer who informs them and, in time, support from those who served alongside their son or daughter.

Mr. Kelly explained that a personal call from the President is in fact not what families expect or want. But it has become something of a presidential tradition, and Mr. Trump asked Mr. Kelly what he should say.

“Alaskan Bush People” star Rain Brown opened up about her struggle with depression on an Instagram post Tuesday.

Brown, 14, posted a picture of a quote reading: “You may not understand today or tomorrow, but eventually God will reveal why you went through everything you did.” The reality star’s caption detailed her struggles to get out of bed in the morning and her loss of motivation.

“For the past few days I’ve been struggling with some things, such as my depression, life, and some teen girl probs too (ya know a broken nail) and I couldn’t figure out why I was in such bad shape. I stayed in bed for about four days with minor aches and pains and I couldn’t find out a reason, it bothered me so much, I lost any want to be healthy or motivational, I was just a husk,” Brown wrote.

A post shared by Rainy Brown (@heroofkirrkwell) on Oct 2, 2017 at 11:20pm PDT

LINDSEY STIRLING ON HOW ON HOW SHE EMERGED FROM 'TERRIFYING' COCOON OF DEPRESSION AND ANOREXIA

She continued that although it felt wrong to “stay in bed and watch videos” it was sometimes “okay” to not do anything.

“In the time of all this happening I told myself that over and over but it also hit me I had to actually believe it and just let it go and stop being bothered by it, I still feel kinda down and like being lazy, but that’s alright because my body knows what it needs and if that’s rest I won’t be one to refuse,” Brown said.

She concluded with telling her fans to stay strong and not to let “depression or dark feelings” get you down.

The Brown family, which stars on the hit Discovery Channel reality show, learned in June 2016 that the family’s matriarch, Ami Brown, had stage 4 lung cancer. The family shared Ami’s diagnosis during an episode that aired this June. In the episode, Rain said she was “very scared” for her mother.

“I don’t care who you are. I don’t care what you’ve been through. I don’t care how old you are. If you hear that your mother has cancer, it’s going to shock you,” Rain said. “I just wish I could change it somehow. I’m very scared for her.”

In an interview with People in August, Ami opened up about the pain she was enduring as she underwent radiation and chemotherapy in Southern California. She said her seven children were each handling her sickness “differently.”

"This was a little drastic for strengthening … there are good days and bad days – for them and for me. But they handle their emotions pretty good. There are days that they have to talk about it and then talk about it again," Ami Brown said. "I have faith that they will remain strong."

Three soda makers are being sued because their diet drinks allegedly make people fat.

Six soft drink lovers, each of whom has struggled with obesity, claim the aspertame in the diet beverages made by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple made them pack on the pounds rather than shed weight.

Lawsuits were filed against each of the beverage giants.

The companies’ diet drinks contain aspertame, a sugar substitute, which some recent studies have shown can cause cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as lead to weight gain, the suits claim.

The weight gain happens because aspertame interferes with the body’s ability to metabolize calories, the court filings allege.

Marketing these brands as “diet” is false, misleading and unlawful, the suits claim.

The suits are among a number of such legal actions filed against food companies, including one earlier this month against Tootsie Roll Industries for selling products that only partially fill the box they are in.

Some industry experts dismiss them as frivolous, driven by profit-seeking law firms. But the soda suits appear to have some merit, according Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.

“One point is clear: Diet sodas have not been shown to promote weight loss,” Nestle said, calling the recent research about aspertame “suggestive and interesting, but not fully proven.”

Coca-Cola said in a statement, “This lawsuit is completely meritless, and we will vigorously defend against it.”

Dr Pepper Snapple said the suit is “completely without merit” and said “sound scientific studies” back the effectiveness of their sweeteners’ ability to help people maintain their weight.

Pepsico did not return requests for comment. The company dumped aspertame from its diet drink in 2015, replacing it with another artificial sweetener, sucralose — and then reintroduced it last year after its diet soda sales plummeted.

“Our case is focused on aspertame, but all artificial sweetners” behave the same in your body, said Derek Smith, whose eponymous law firm is lead counsel in all three soda cases.

As we’ve all been understandably focused on Hollywood’s Weinstein dumpster fire, a number of stories have emerged exposing the left’s continuing culture war, despite its meltdown in the film industry. The Harvey Weinstein saga is but one symptom of a dangerous and destructive, yet smug and sanctimonious, liberal establishment. While they butcher American culture, civil society and history, how better to keep us normals from interfering than by blaming their victims for society’s ills?

Cases in point from the last week, reminding us there are many fronts in our fight to save this nation from the bullies of the pompous left:

Dr. Pamela Gaudry was a passenger on a Delta flight that also carried one of our fallen soldiers. Upon landing, the captain announced that the body of Army Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, who was killed on Oct. 4 in Niger, was on board and asked everyone to stay seated.

After Dr. Gaudry organized a few other passengers to join her in singing the national anthem, she was stopped by a flight attendant who, according to a Facebook video posted by the doctor, told her it was against “policy” to sing the anthem on the plane.

“The chief flight attendant came back to my seat and she kneeled down and she said, ‘It is against company policy to do what you’re doing,’ ” Dr. Gaudry said in the video. “And I said, ‘The national anthem? And there’s a soldier onboard?’ And she said, ‘Yes, you cannot sing the national anthem. It is against company policy.’ ” Delta has told reporters there is no such policy. The New York Post also reported that Dr. Gaudry was told singing “The Star Spangled Banner” would “offend” other passengers on the plane.

The airline is investigating the matter. In the meantime, Dr. Gaudry’s video has gone viral, and the physician told Fox News that Delta called to apologize and Sgt. Wright’s family called to thank her.

Also last week, the Biloxi, Mississippi, school board pulled the American classic “To Kill a Mockingbird” from its curriculum because, according to the school board president, “There is some language in the book that makes people uncomfortable,” the Sun Herald reported.

The book, Harper Lee’s Pulitzer-Prize winning novel, is an American masterpiece about the trial of a black man as it explores rape, racism and inequality in the Depression-era South. While the Biloxi school board did not specify which language made people uncomfortable, the “N-word” is used over 50 times, within character conversations.

The newspaper that broke the story learned about the decision from a reader.

“Sun Herald received an email from a concerned reader who said the decision was made ‘mid-lesson plan.’ The students will not be allowed to finish the reading of ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ … due to the use of the ‘N-word.’ … ‘I think it is one of the most disturbing examples of censorship I have ever heard, in that the themes in the story humanize all people regardless of their social status, education level, intellect, and of course, race. It would be difficult to find a time when it was more relevant than in days like these.’ “

And then there’s Halloween.

“The latest issue of a magazine run by Ohio State University students features a flow-chart designed to help students determine whether their Halloween costume is racist,” the watchdog group Campus Reform reported. ” ‘Is it politically charged?’ the chart asks of costume ideas that pertain to ‘something serious.’ If yes, the magazine is interested only in whether [it] makes fun of Donald Trump, in which case the chart advises the reader to ‘DO IT.’ “

The costume police, we do learn, are totally OK with a student wearing cultural headgear, but only if you’re a person of color.

The scheme of liberal political correctness was never about genuinely making American culture more gallant, it was about inculcating everyone into believing that American culture was diseased and needed to be fixed. When, in fact, it was the liberal agenda itself that needed a deflection.

We see how well that worked in Hollywood. Those victimized are not just vulnerable women, but men and children as well. Yet, the obsession curated by liberal leadership like Hillary Clinton, Weinstein and leftist politicians and activists everywhere was that Republicans and Donald Trump were the demons.

On Twitter, cultural critic Kurt Schlichter put it perfectly, “No wonder these Hollywood hacks spend so much time screaming about Trump. They’re consumed by guilt over their own complicity so they strike out at somebody who they’ll only get praise for challenging while leaving others in their own business to keep being victimized. Cowards.”

The left is sure they can quash the social compact and idea of America itself by convincing a portion of the public that being ‘offended’ is the standard by which we can and should censor and punish. The national anthem is racist, literature highlighting how far we’ve come as a nation is offensive, and even choices people make for costumes are rife with white supremacy and hatred. They say.

As liberals insist we look away, they continue to destroy peoples’ lives. It’s taking work and courage, but we must continue to expose the liberal machine controlling both Washington, D.C., and Hollywood as the dangerous hypocrites and liars they are.

Melania Trump cuts bloated first lady payroll from Michelle Obama days

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady's office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.
This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June.
But even counting all those employees -- 24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady -- Melania Trump's office is relatively small.
According to those personnel reports, Melania Trump’s staffers include a chief of staff, a communications director, a deputy chief of staff and a deputy director of advance.
During the first few months of the Trump presidency, Melania Trump and son, Barron, remained in New York as he finished the school year.

Melania Trump is embracing a more active and public schedule as first lady – but she still runs one of the leanest East Wing operations in recent history.

According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady's office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.

During then-President Barack Obama’s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year.

This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June. Their salaries totaled $486,700.

Melania Trump staff salaries Lindsay B. Reynolds -- $179,700.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady

-- $179,700.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady Stephanie A. Grisham -- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady

-- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady Timothy G. Tripepi -- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff of operations for the first lady

-- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff of operations for the first lady Mary‐Kathryn Fisher -- $77,000.00 – deputy director of advance for the first lady Source: June 2017 report to Congress on White House personnel

The details are contained in an annual report the White House sends to Congress showing the names, positions and salaries of all its personnel. Both the Obama and Trump administrations acknowledged several additional staffers beyond those listed in the report with the term “first lady” in their titles. But even counting all those employees -- 24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady -- Melania Trump's office is relatively small.

It's an approach her spokeswoman says is intentional.

“As with all things that she does, she is being very deliberate in her hiring, focusing on quality over quantity,” communications director Stephanie Grisham said in an email. “It is important to her that the team is a good fit for what she wants to accomplish as first lady, and that everyone works well together. She also wants to be mindful and responsible when it comes to taxpayer money.”

MELANIA TRUMP SLAMS IVANA FOR CALLING HERSELF FIRST LADY

While the 2009 annual report listed 16 staffers for Michelle Obama, her press secretary said at the time the staff actually included 24 people. A 2009 FactCheck.org story said Obama’s 24 aides might have broken records.

“That may indeed be the largest of any first lady, but Hillary Clinton, with 19 staffers, and Laura Bush with at least 18 and perhaps more, weren’t far behind,” FactCheck.org said.

Michelle Obama staff salaries Susan S. Sher -- $172,200.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady

-- $172,200.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady Jocelyn C. Frye -- $140,000.00 -- deputy assistant to the president and director of policy and projects for the first lady

-- $140,000.00 -- deputy assistant to the president and director of policy and projects for the first lady Camille Y. Johnston -- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady

-- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady Melissa E. Winter -- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff to the first lady

-- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff to the first lady David S. Medina -- $90,000.00 – deputy chief of staff to the first lady

-- $90,000.00 – deputy chief of staff to the first lady Catherine M. Lelyveld -- $84,000.00 director and press secretary to the first lady

-- $84,000.00 director and press secretary to the first lady Frances M. Starkey -- $75,000.00 – director of scheduling and advance for the first lady

-- $75,000.00 – director of scheduling and advance for the first lady Trooper Sanders -- $70,000.00 -- deputy director of policy and projects for the first lady

-- $70,000.00 -- deputy director of policy and projects for the first lady Jennifer R. Goodman -- $62,000.00 – deputy director of scheduling and events coordinator for the first lady

-- $62,000.00 – deputy director of scheduling and events coordinator for the first lady Alan Fitts -- $60,000.00 – deputy director of advance and trip director for the first lady

-- $60,000.00 – deputy director of advance and trip director for the first lady Dana M. Lewis -- $60,000.00 – special assistant and personal aide to the first lady

-- $60,000.00 – special assistant and personal aide to the first lady Semonti M. Mustaphi -- $52,500.00 – associate director and deputy press secretary to the first lady

-- $52,500.00 – associate director and deputy press secretary to the first lady Kristen E. Jarvis -- $50,000.00 – special assistant for scheduling and traveling aide to the first lady

-- $50,000.00 – special assistant for scheduling and traveling aide to the first lady Tyler A. Lechtenberg -- $45,000.00 – associate director of correspondence for the first lady

-- $45,000.00 – associate director of correspondence for the first lady Joseph J. Boswell -- $40,000.00 – executive assistant to the chief of staff to the first lady

-- $40,000.00 – executive assistant to the chief of staff to the first lady Deilia A. Jackson -- $36,000.00 – deputy associate director of correspondence for the first lady Source: July 2009 report to Congress on White House personnel

Grisham told Fox News this week there are nine people working in the East Wing under Melania Trump, a few more than listed in the annual report.

According to those personnel reports, Melania Trump’s staffers include a chief of staff, a communications director, a deputy chief of staff and a deputy director of advance.

Michelle Obama’s staff included those same positions and a slew of others: additional press aides, a director of policy and projects, a personal aide, a traveling aide and a director of correspondence.

Michelle Obama’s office did not return a request for comment.

But the larger staff is likely due in part to Michelle Obama entering the East Wing with a more aggressive agenda and embracing initiatives like her Let's Move! child obesity campaign.

During the first few months of the Trump presidency, Melania Trump and son, Barron, remained in New York as he finished the school year.

But she has noticeably ramped up public activity in recent weeks, including hosting a roundtable discussion on the opioid crisis and traveling with her husband to tour the destruction of hurricanes and meet with the victims of the Las Vegas massacre.

“She is more like a Pat Nixon or a Bess Truman than a Hillary Clinton or a Michelle Obama,” Andrew Och, a first lady historian who was a producer for the C-SPAN's “First Ladies: Influence and Image” series, said of Melania Trump.

Och noted that there is no formal job description for a first lady and each one defines their role. Melania Trump, he said, does not come from the world of politics and “clearly does not feel the need for the larger staffs that her predecessors have had.”

The first lady’s office isn’t the only place in the White House where the Trump administration has trimmed staff positions. When the White House personnel report was released in June, Forbes reported 110 fewer employees under Donald Trump than Barack Obama and said the projected four-year savings resulting from the cuts could be more than $22 million.

Chris Long is donating the rest of his year’s salary to increase educational equality.

The Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive end already gave up his first six game checks to provide two scholarships for students in Charlottesville, Virginia. Now, he’s using the next 10 to launch the Pledge 10 for Tomorrow campaign.

“My wife and I have been passionate about education being a gateway for upward mobility and equality,” Long told The Associated Press. “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help affect change that we all want to see in this country.”

Long signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Eagles, including a $500,000 signing bonus and $1.5 million guaranteed. His base salary in 2017 is $1 million.

The charitable initiative encourages people to make donations to improve equal education opportunities. Long began his career in St. Louis in 2008 and played for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season. Long’s foundation has selected four organizations whose missions focus on making education easily accessible to underserved youth while also providing students the support they need to develop strong social and emotional character.

The four organizations are based in the three communities in which Long has played during his NFL career. The city that raises the most money during the season will receive an additional $50,000 donation.

“There’s a lot of opportunities to help out and they’re wonderful organizations,” Long said. “We have such a great platform as football players and hopefully fans get behind it.”

Long grew up in Charlottesville and starred in high school at St. Anne’s-Belfield before going to the University of Virginia. He was moved to start the scholarship program following the violent protests in Charlottesville in August.

“Our hometown is a wonderful place and I feel like people got the wrong idea about what the residents of Charlottesville are all about,” he said.

Although necessary to ensure the cleanliness of a meal, hot foods continue to steam underneath the lids and cook themselves even further after leaving the kitchen.
“Vented lids cause crispy fried items like fries, onion rings, or even fried shrimp to get soggy from the steam,” Skipp Worden, executive chef at the Westin Jekyll Island in Georgia, told Southern Living.
But for those dead set on a particular menu item, there are a few hacks to ensure your meal is edible once it arrives.
Avoid soggy fries by requesting they’re cooked extra crispy — or even burnt, Worden says.
Request steak one degree rarer than normal, as it will continue to cook on the delivery trolley.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Few things are as luxurious as waking up in a hotel room and having a slow breakfast in bed with a plush robe and slippers — except when the lids come off to reveal a plate of congealed eggs, soggy potatoes, and lukewarm coffee.

Preparing food is both an art and a science. And much like how chefs must change their recipes for airplanes, there are certain dishes that should be altered to make the transition from kitchen to room service.

The problem lies in the hospitality lid. Although necessary to ensure the cleanliness of a meal, hot foods continue to steam underneath the lids and cook themselves even further after leaving the kitchen.

“Vented lids cause crispy fried items like fries, onion rings, or even fried shrimp to get soggy from the steam,” Skipp Worden, executive chef at the Westin Jekyll Island in Georgia, told Southern Living.

The lids can also cause cooked vegetables to lose their flavor and texture, pizza to soften its crispy crust, and soup to change textures.

But for those dead set on a particular menu item, there are a few hacks to ensure your meal is edible once it arrives. Avoid soggy fries by requesting they’re cooked extra crispy — or even burnt, Worden says. However when ordering meat, do the exact opposite. Request steak one degree rarer than normal, as it will continue to cook on the delivery trolley.

Police were called to meet the flight upon arrival, at which point they subdued the man, Cannon says.
"He kept screaming, 'I'm a business owner, I'm a business owner,'" she told the Riverfront Times.
"He wanted everybody to know that he is a business man and he had white privilege and a white card.

A Phoenix woman is claiming she’ll never fly with Frontier Airlines again after a “racist” passenger loudly declared he was “pulling his white card” during an argument that erupted mid-flight.

Furthermore, the Riverfront Times of St. Louis reports that the “drunk” man has yet to be criminally charged for causing a disturbance aboard the flight, despite police and EMS workers being called to deal with him upon arrival.

"He does have this invisible white card," Shemekia Cannon told the Riverfront Times. "They’re protecting this man to the point where we don’t even know his name. He’s alive, living his life, thinking this is all over. That's how I know that card exists."

WOMAN SAYS DELTA AIR LINES PREVENTED HER FROM SINGING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The incident originally took place aboard a flight from St. Louis to Denver on June 10, though footage of the altercation was only shared on YouTube earlier this week. In the video, the man can he heard using profanity and repeatedly telling Cannon — who is black — that he was “pulling his white card” when she asked to be re-seated.

WARNING: Footage contains profane language. Viewer discretion is advised.

Cannon told the Riverfront Times that she first saw the unidentified man drinking in the airport terminal while flirting with the redheaded woman who was later seated to his left. Aboard the flight, she says Frontier continued to serve him alcohol despite being visibly drunk. Cannon also says he continued flirting inappropriately with the redheaded woman, telling her how he wanted to take her to the plane’s restroom, and describing the size of his penis. He also began rubbing his crotch area, she says.

"When he described his penis size, I couldn’t take it no more,” said Cannon. "I told [the flight attendants] what he’d said.”

Cannon alleges that a flight attendant came by and told the man he was no longer allowed to order alcohol, which prompted him to turn to the redheaded woman and say, "Don't worry, I have white privilege, I have a white card."

"I went from zero to a million,” remembers Cannon. “I looked at him and I said, 'You’re a racist son of a b----.'”

AIR BERLIN FLIGHT MAKES STRANGE MANEUVER, SPARKING SAFETY PROBE

In the above footage, subsequently captured by Cannon, the man can be heard repeating that he’d be “pulling his white card” after Cannon told the crew to “get him away from me.”

Cannon also told the Riverfront Times that she was moved to a different seat, but that the man continued arguing with flight attendants.

Police were called to meet the flight upon arrival, at which point they subdued the man, Cannon says.

"He kept screaming, 'I'm a business owner, I'm a business owner,'" she told the Riverfront Times. "He wanted everybody to know that he is a business man and he had white privilege and a white card. He was flailing and fighting everybody."

Later, inside the terminal, Cannon says she met a woman who claimed to have captured footage of the unidentified man being rolled through the airport on a gurney.

Cannon’s lawyer later received a letter from the airline apologizing for the incident. However, Frontier wrote that they felt the crew’s actions “were appropriate for the situation and regret any discomfort caused to Ms. Cannon.” They also issued her a $250 flight voucher.

The Riverfront Times further confirmed through the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado that the man has not faced any criminal charges for his actions, though the matter is “under investigation.”

Frontier did not confirm to Fox News whether they were planning to take any further action against the unidentified passenger.

"We take allegations of misconduct very seriously and have worked internally to investigate Ms. Cannon’s concerns,” wrote the airline in a statement. “The comfort, safety and security of our crew and passengers is our first priority at all times."

Louisville trustees have fired athletic director Tom Jurich in the wake of its involvement in a national federal investigation of college basketball.

The Board of Trustees voted 10-3 on Wednesday to fire Jurich after 20 years as the school’s AD. Jurich, 61, had been placed on paid administrative Sept. 27 by interim university President Greg Postel. Louisville’s Athletic Association fired men’s basketball coach Rick Pitino on Monday.

Jurich shepherded Louisville’s 2014 entry into the Atlantic Coast Conference. He also was responsible for facility upgrades and saw numerous sports thrive under coaches he hired.

Vince Tyra was named acting AD since Oct. 3, a move the Athletic Association approved on Monday before firing Pitino.

Louisville’s acknowledgment of being part of a federal probe into bribery of college recruits proved to be Jurich’s undoing. Postel’s Sept. 27 disciplinary letter to the AD called allegations in the complaint “disturbing and unprecedented.” His letter also called “unacceptable” the level of misconduct, alleged criminal activity and the negative attention it has brought to Louisville.

Postel also criticized Jurich for failing to update or consult the athletic board about his negotiation of the department’s sponsorship extension with Adidas.

Jurich’s lawyer, Alison M. Stemler, disputed Postel’s allegations in a letter that also questioned whether school’s disciplinary action might violate a contract clause.

Several Jurich supporters carrying signs urging trustees to retain the AD gathered outside the Grawemeyer administration building and briefly inside the meeting room. Jurich’s attorney, Alison M. Stemler, and members of Jurich’s legal team joined the meeting shortly after it began.

Trustees ultimately followed the same path as the ULAA, deciding to part ways with Jurich and move forward.

Jurich departs as construction continues on a $63 million expansion of the football stadium due for completion by next season. He had a long record of accomplishments that helped Louisville build one of the nation’s top athletic programs.

Jurich also remained loyal to coaches he hired, to a fault in some cases.

Jurich hired Pitino as coach in 2001 and celebrated Louisville’s third NCCA men’s basketball championship trophy 12 years later in perhaps the school’s most successful year in athletics.

The Cardinals’ women’s basketball team reached the NCAA championship game that same season and has remained a perennial NCAA Tournament contender. Both programs play in a 22,000-seat downtown arena that opened in 2010.

Lamar Jackson became Louisville’s first Heisman Trophy winner last year when the Cardinals flirted with a berth in the college football playoff. The Cardinals in 1998 began playing in Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium, which is undergoing its second expansion from its original 42,000-seat capacity.

The baseball team is coming off its third College World Series berth in five years and is also preparing to expand its stadium.

Jurich was scrutinized for his decision to re-hire football coach Bobby Petrino in January 2014, less than two years after Arkansas fired Petrino for misleading school officials about a motorcycle accident in which his passenger was later revealed to be his mistress.

Jurich’s support of Pitino through a series of embarrassing transgressions in recent years drew the most criticism.

Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.

'Me Too' necklace sparks backlash, but the designer stands by it

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain.
Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.
“Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN.
Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The hashtag #MeToo has been trending on social media over the last few days after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged others to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault. But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a "ME TOO" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. "I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not."

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

“For me, it was very personal, as I was a victim of sexual abuse as a child. I made [this necklace] for myself and my friends encouraged me to share it…We have seen several orders in the last day, so the necklace resonates with some. There are women who want to share their experience openly and others who do not. This necklace is for the former category. People cope differently with pain, and my intention was not to offend, rather give back and provide vehicle for expression based on recent outpouring on the topic.”

Country singer Kaylee Keller has 'enough self worth' to say 'no' to opportunities that conflict with her values

Blonde, bubbly and equipped with a long, southern drawl, Kaylee Keller has all the makings of a country superstar.

What sets this Kansas girl apart is Keller's desire to sing tunes that are more than "just fun to listen to." The 20-year-old hopes her fans will find the inspiration they are looking for in her songs.

"My goal in music is to have a really strong message in each one of my songs," Keller told Fox News.

Keller's own experiences facing bullying in high school inspired her to use her celebrity for to help her younger fans.

"I hear a lot of celebrities sometimes talk and they say, 'Oh well, I'm just being me and if you let your kids watch me, that's on you.' But I feel like if you're somebody who is in the limelight, or you have a platform, it is your responsibility to do something with that and to know that people are looking at you and every choice that you make and every word that you say is accountable for."

Watch the exclusive debut of Kaylee Keller's new music video for "Nowhere America" below:

The "Diamond" singer told us she wants to use her platform "to speak my morals [and to share] what I believe."

In order to do that, Keller has turned down opportunities that don't match what she stands for. When a modeling agency approached her and asked her to pose for a bikini photo shoot with the promise it would launch her career, Keller said no.

"I think one of the biggest industry lies is if you say no, the opportunity is never going to approach you again," Keller said. "I've got enough self worth to say, 'You know what? No, I'm not going to do that.'"

As that door shut, another door opened for the aspiring star. She recently released her first EP called "Rubies" and Fox News is exclusively debuting the music video for her new single "Nowhere America."

"This song really just captures who I am as a person," she told us. "[My co-writer and I wrote about] our home roots and what we grew up with and our core values and the values of America [and said], 'Let's capture that in a song.'"

A post shared by Kaylee Keller (@kayleekellermusic) on Sep 27, 2017 at 11:19am PDT

The song is about a girl who loves to travel and be in "the big city" but is a small town girl at heart.

"At the end of the day, "I'm a Kansas girl that my grandpa says likes 'meat and potatoes.' [He tells me,] 'You're a meat and potatoes kind of kid.' Thanks grandpa, but I wouldn't change it."

Clothing company's racy ad campaign featuring naked men called out for being 'sexist'

A women's suit company has launched a racy new ad campaign featuring women in sleek, tailored suits alongside men in, well, nothing.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

It was staged as a DUI, but resulted in a newly engaged couple.

A deputy in Palmdale, California recruited is colleagues to help stage a fake DUI traffic stop so he can propose to his girlfriend. Deputy Kevin Bowes’ fellow deputies pulled over his girlfriend and asked her to complete a DUI sobriety test. She had no idea Bowes was bent down on one knee behind her, with an engagement ring in hand.

In video shared by the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station, Bowes is seen arriving to the “scene” as his girlfriend looks up to the sky and taps her nose during one of the sobriety tests. The recruited deputy then asks her to spin around. Once she does, she finds her soon-to-be fiancé bent down on one knee.

She runs up to hug him and he can be heard saying, “Is that a yes?” and she nods in approval.

The deputy who was conducting the supposed sobriety test asked again, “That was a yes? Okay just wanted to make sure” and laughs.

The agency shared the following caption with the video:

Congratulations to future Mrs. Deputy Bowes

The owners of a southwest Colorado pizza restaurant said they will take down bathroom signs that shows a man lifting a woman’s skirt, the Durango Herald reports.

HomeSlice Pizza owners Cory and Lynn Kitch said the signs are not offensive and do not promote sexual assault as critics claim.

The Kitches said they are taking down the signs to prevent their employees from receiving any more backlash.

Two signs have been at one of HomeSlice Pizza’s locations in Durango since it opened four years ago. But after they went viral on social media, the restaurant owners and employees came under fire.

Several comments were left on HomeSlice’s Facebook page seeking confirmation the signs were real and to pressure the owners to take them down.

Lynn Kitch said told the newspaper in an email that the business and its employees have been harassed and cyberbullied after the photo gained more attention.

“I understand that some people have deep rooted emotional issues stemming from sexual impropriety, and for that I have compassion,” Lynn Kitch wrote in an email to the newspaper.

“I would invite them to deal with their pain in a more productive manner than projecting their anger on a bathroom sign, or a pizza restaurant, or certainly a restaurant employee.”

The Kitches said they will auction off at least one of the bathroom signs and donate the proceeds to Durango-based Sexual Assault Service Organization.

When adjusting to life with a new baby, teamwork and solidarity is key for parents. Recently, one sweet young dad went above and beyond to ensure that his partner didn’t feel self-conscious over a breastfeeding stain.

Taking to Facebook on Oct. 12 to share the story, Chris Lopez of Chino, Calif, wrote that she and her partner, Cee Grant, were running errands one morning when Grant surprised her with a funny stain on his button-down dress shirt. Grant’s spot wasn’t accidental, but rather intentional, to show support for the mother of his two children, who is currently nursing their youngest.

“I didn’t know that I was leaking, and I was like, ‘What are you doing?’ He said, ‘Look at your nipple.’ It was a nice way to stop me from being humiliated,” Lopez told Yahoo Lifestyle. “I fell in love with him because he was always that person to turn an awkward moment into a hilarious moment.”

The gesture gave Lopez much more than a laugh. According to Lopez, Grant was recovering from a substance abuse problem back when she was breastfeeding their first child Dominic, who is now three, and his love and support as she breastfeeds little Camilla, almost 11 months old, makes all the difference.

“When my son came, he was trying to get better. He couldn’t really be there for me. He was just trying to survive, really,” Lopez told the site. “We were together for the baby and we really loved each other, but I knew that he had some serious stuff going on.”

The mom added that she felt “a lot of pain and sadness” through her initial struggles with breastfeeding, and felt guilty when her milk for Dominic dried up. After a successful recovery, Lopez described Grant as “the real deal” in supporting her as she nurses Camilla.

Faith is a guiding force in the lives of Chip and Joanna Gaines, of "Fixer Upper" fame.

"For me, [faith] changed everything," Chip told us. "It's a part of who I am. I can't separate the two."

The contractor said while his relationship with God plays an important role in every aspect of his life, he doesn't want to come off as preachy.

"I try not to rub it in anybody's face," he explained. "I'm not real boisterous about it but people seem to find out about it just through the way that Jo and I live our lives."

He added, "And we're proud of that."

A post shared by Chip Gaines (@chipgaines) on Oct 16, 2017 at 6:06pm PDT

The father of four said the things they learned growing up "have influenced the way we love each other; it influences the way we parent our children; it influences the kind of people we want to be in our community. It's extremely important to me personally."

While Chip said he and Joanna don't want to push their faith onto anyone else, they have been vocal about the way it impacts their lives in the past.

4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing.
Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own.
Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.
Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit.
Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.

Nissan is launching its new semi-autonomous ProPilot Assist system in the Rogue crossover, its best-selling vehicle, before it arrives in the all-new electric Leaf next year.

The system uses a camera and radar to allow a vehicle to steer itself in the middle of a lane on the highway, while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of it. Nissan sales and marketing boss, Christian Meunier, said that he expects around 30 percent of Rogues to be equipped with the feature.

Unlike some competing systems, ProPilot Assist isn’t meant for anything resembling hands-off driving. It’s only there to make your life easier and safer, especially if you’re flaking out, hence the “Assist” part of the name. If it senses you’ve let go of the wheel, alarms will start going off within about 10 seconds with increasing urgency until you grab it again. If not, the system will slowly shut itself down and bring the vehicle to a stop in the lane it is currently driving in with the hazard lights on.

I recently had the opportunity to take a prototype Rogue fitted with ProPilot Assist on a short drive in New York City. It quickly locks onto lane markers and engages, but needs two well-defined lines to work. Faded paint will cause it to deactivate, as will the veering lines at exit ramps. It’s at its best in a center lane, where it holds itself dead center, even through wide radius curves. If they're too tight for the speed the vehicle is traveling at, ProPilot Assist will alert the driver to take back full control.

More impressive than its lane-keeping ability is the adaptive cruise control component of the system. This isn’t a new concept, but many cars so equipped apply the brakes abruptly when the car they’re following slows down or one pulls into their lane, often jarring passengers. ProPilot Assist has the same smooth touch as a very alert driver, and works in stop-and-go traffic, as long as the vehicle doesn’t stay stationary for very long.

Overall, ProPilot Assist is a step behind similar systems that Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Volvo currently offer, but is far ahead of anything available from Nissan's peers in the mainstream automotive segment. Nissan has sketched out a roadmap toward a fully autonomous car by 2022, however, so the abilities of its technology should increase quickly and dramatically in the coming years.

ProPilot Assist will be available initially only on the top of the line Rogue SL equipped with an optional Platinum Package at a starting price of $34,875.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Researchers at New York University's Langone School of Medicine said in an interview that people who've temporarily died are aware that their life has ended, and might be able to hear a doctor announcing their death.

Scientists at the New York City school told The Independent newspaper that they’re studying patients who've suffered cardiac arrest but have been revived. These doctors say some survivors recall vivid conversations that went on around them — even several minutes after they were pronounced dead.

The paper defined death as the stage where the heart no longer beats and “blood flow to the brain” cuts off. Live Science reported that the cerebral cortex also slows down instantly and within two to 20 seconds flatlines.

“You lose all your brain stem reflexes,” Dr. Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation at the school, told the paper. “Your gag reflex, your pupil reflex, all that is gone.”

The evidence reportedly suggests a surge of brain activity immediately after a near-death experience.

"What tends to happen is that people who've had these very profound experiences may come back positively transformed — they become more altruistic, more engaged with helping others. They find a new meaning to life having had an encounter with death," Parnia said. "But there isn't like a sudden magical enhancement of their memories," he added. "That's just Hollywood jazz."

Country star Jason Aldean brought the party back Thursday in his return to the stage following the deadly mass shooting that broke out while he was performing in Las Vegas, but the fun was tempered by the sting of the tragedy.

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

"These people are going to continue to try to hold us down," Aldean said. "To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care."

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

"I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to," he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said "Vegas Strong," a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

"It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time," she said. "We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope."

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album "They Don't Know," which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including "Big Green Tractor," ''Fly Over States" and "She's Country," and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's "I Won't Back Down" on "Saturday Night Live" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

Authorities have said Stephen Paddock targeted the country music festival, opening fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel before killing himself. They are still trying to determine a motive.

A Florida nursing home that charged one of its residents who died when Hurricane Irma created sweltering conditions at the facility has blamed an automatic payment system for the error, and claims that the family has been refunded.

The relatives of Albertina Vega, who was a resident at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, said they were shocked to see the bank withdrawal and subsequent overdraft fee on her account, The Sun Sentinel reported.

Vega, who was 99 at the time of her death, was charged $958 on what would have been her 100th birthday. Carmen Fernandez, a relative, said she saw the charge and fee when she went to close the woman’s account, the news outlet reported.

INSURER ALLEGEDLY SENDS COVERAGE DENIAL LETTER TO 9-MONTH-OLD WITH BRAIN CANCER

“How are they going to charge a dead person?” Fernandez told The Sun Sentinel. “How is she going to pay that? I was enraged. They let her die and then they bill her. This was someone who was like a mother to me.”

Vega was one of the 14 residents who died when the facility’s central air conditioning failed during the hurricane. She was living on the second floor of the nursing home, which did not have air conditioning for three days, the news outlet reported. Hollywood police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into the deaths, but Fernandez wonders if Medicaid has also been billed for Vega’s care, or if the other victims have received similar bills.

The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration would not comment on the incident, but said the facility was suspended from the Medicaid program in September, according to The Sun Sentinel.

Fernandez said she filed a complaint with the bank manager, while a spokeswoman for the nursing home said the billing was part of an automated system that was beyond the facility’s control.

“Unfortunately, in this family’s case, this was an automatic deduction,” Alia Faraj-Johnson told The Sun Sentinel. “Due to circumstances beyond the facility’s control and their lack of access to what they need – the computers in the system – the withdrawal automatically occurred.”

Russia’s homegrown version of Paris Hilton has announced she is to stand against Vladimir Putin in next year’s presidential election.

Reality TV star Ksenia Sobchak said she hopes to appeal to the growing number of liberal voters unhappy with Putin’s many years in office.

Tender is the Night ...) Total look by @yanaraskovalova A post shared by Ксения Собчак (@xenia_sobchak) on Oct 13, 2017 at 10:13am PDT

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

Sobchak, who died in 2000, became a mentor to Putin. Sobchak’s mother, Lyudmila Narusova, sits in the upper house of the Russian parliament.

Sobchak’s Instagram account, often featuring photographs of her dressed in designer outfits and appearing at glitzy society events, has 5.2 million followers.

After graduating from the prestigious MGIMO University in Moscow, she became a nationwide celebrity when she hosted a Russian reality TV show called Dom 2.

She became active in opposition politics around the time that Putin, in 2012, was reelected to the presidency after stepping down for four years to comply with constitutional term limits.

She appeared at opposition rallies, spoke out against the Kremlin on social media, and recast herself as a news anchor for the Rain broadcaster.

Inflatable space habitats may sound like the stuff of science fiction to some, but such a contraption actually already exists in the form of a one-room module currently attached to the International Space Station for testing.

Built by Las Vegas-based Bigelow, the company now has its eye on taking its blow-up living area far beyond the space station, all the way to the moon.

Partnering with United Launch Alliance a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Space Systems Bigelow said it hopes to send put the B330 expandable space habitat into lunar orbit by 2022.

Announcing the ambitious project this week, Bigelow president Robert Bigelow said the fully autonomous space station would provide anchorage "for significant lunar business development in addition to offering NASA and other governments the moon as a new, exciting location to conduct long-term exploration and astronaut training.

Bigelows B330 habitat a larger version of the BEAM module currently attached to the space station is composed of a super-strong, multi-layered Kevlar-esque material. One of its big advantages is that it can be packed into a small space for cheaper and more efficient transportation before being inflated to five times its original size once in space. NASA first outlined the idea for BEAM before Bigelow took on its development about 10 years ago.

The company says the expandable habitat, which is about a third of the size of the space station has the potential to be used for pretty much anything, including a microgravity research center, a space farm, a dormitory for deep space missions,a kitchen/cafeteria for astronauts, and even as a "private space yacht" for wealthy vacationers looking for a different kind of trip.

Bigelow

If Bigelow can raise the funds for its grand plan, the B330 would begin its journey to the moon on a Vulcan 562 rocket that would first take it to low-Earth orbit. During this phase, the habitat would be expanded, kitted out, and tested for any issues. Once fully operational, the B330 would embark on its journey to low-lunar orbit.

Bigelow said his "lunar depot plan is a strong complement to other plans intended to eventually put people on Mars." Indeed, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have suggested that billions of dollars could be saved by using the moon as a pit-stop for eventual missions to the red planet.

The last time humans ventured all the way to the moon was in 1972, but in recent years countries around the world have been showing increasing interest in making a return visit. Only this month, Vice President Mike Pence saidNASA would put humans on the moon once again, while both China and Japan are aiming for separate missions by 2020 and 2030, respectively. And before then, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said his SpaceX company is hoping to send two space tourists on a week-long trip around the moon, while Amazon's Jeff Bezos, CEO of space firm Blue Origin, has floated the idea of a "permanently inhabited lunar settlement."

Farmer Gene Hanson of Edgeley, North Dakota has a message for the NFL: “We stand for the National Anthem.”

The 77-year-old Midwesterner plowed that phrase into his bean crops - a massive message spanning the length of two football fields - in response to the controversial protest undertaken by some NFL players who've begun kneeling during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner."

“I go with [President] Trump on this one,” Hanson told Fox News on Tuesday. “If you want to protest, that’s not the place to do it.”

He added: “A lot of people died over our flag. We’re able to voice our opinion because of it. If you’re going to show respect for anything, do it for the national anthem.”

Hanson has a track record of designing and digging massive messages – many political – using his old Massey tractor on his 850-acre farm.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson told Fox News he got his “We Stand for the National Anthem” message right on the second try. During the first attempt, he was interrupted by a passerby with only two letters to go. He soon relocated to another section of the field.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

He said his Prince symbol, plowed after the singer passed away, was one of his most popular for fans all over the world, but he caught a lot of flak for his “Never Hillary” message.

“Most responses have been positive, though,” Hanson said.

Is China’s president, Xi Jinping, preparing to transfer his enormous powers to a younger generation of leaders? Or is he quietly ensuring that no one will ever be able to dislodge him as he goes about his plan to make China the most important nation on earth? Judging from his recent actions, the answer is: both.

Xi is presiding this week over the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the unchallenged power in the world’s most populous country. During a 3 ½-hour keynote speech, Xi laid out a plan to make China – and the majority of China’s 1.4 billion people – prosperous by 2050. If that timeline seems to stretch far into the future, it might be because the 64-year-old Xi expects to still be in charge then.

Since assuming office in 2013, Xi has created a cult of personality around himself like no Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. State television ran a week-long homage to him earlier this year. Newspaper headlines extol his virtues. And when he stepped to the podium to deliver his speech, the 2,338 Party delegates leapt to their feet as if their chairs were electrified.

“He has accumulated more power than anyone in China since Deng Xioping,” says Sourabh Gupta, Senior Fellow at Institute of China–America Studies in Washington D.C. Deng led the communist party from 1978 until he technically stepped aside in 1989, though he remained the most powerful man in China nearly until his death in 1997. He is widely credited with converting China from an agrarian economy into a manufacturing superpower.

“This is not Chinese glasnost,” says Gupta, referring to the efforts of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to govern more openly. “Under Xi, there has been a widespread crackdown on individual liberties and political challenges are not tolerated. He’s almost like an emperor.”

Xi wants nothing less than to make China the new center of the world economy, displacing the United States. He calls his master plan “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which might sound vague to Western ears, but which his countrymen understand as a better standard of living for regular Chinese, while maintaining the party’s absolute power over all aspects of their lives.

“This is not Chinese glasnost,” says Gupta, referring to the efforts of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to govern more openly. “Under Xi, there has been a widespread crackdown on individual liberties and political challenges are not tolerated. He’s almost like an emperor.”

It is an unwritten rule that the party’s secretary general give way to someone younger when he (there have been no women leaders) reaches the age of 68. Xi shows no signs of slowing down. He will, however, install some loyal lieutenants to ensure his vision is carried out. One name to watch is Hu Chunhua, 54, the party chief of Guangdong province. He’s a loyalist and, if and when Xi decides to retire, could be China’s next leader.

For baseball fans, Xi’s at bat. But Hu’s on first.

The Latest on a shooting at an office park in northeastern Maryland (all times local):

9:35 a.m.

Family members of the man accused of killing three people and wounding three others in Maryland and Delaware say they feared for their own safety for years because of his mental instability.

A woman who identified herself as a half-sister of 37-year-old Radee Prince told The News Journal that he was angry, paranoid and had an explosive temper.

Melody Starling called Prince a "psychopath" who should have been committed to a mental health facility.

Prince is charged with fatally shooting three of his co-workers and wounding two others at a granite company in Edgewood, Maryland, on Wednesday. He is also charged with shooting and wounding another man in Delaware.

Another woman who said she is Prince's sister said his rage had been building for years and he should have been on medication.

___

3:16 a.m.

A witness to the deadly rampage inside a Maryland granite company says the suspect, Radee Prince, had gathered a small group of his co-workers together by saying "come with me, I want to say something to everybody." Without another word, he opened fire.

The witness, a man who worked at the countertop making company for a year and a half, said when Prince arrived Wednesday morning he responded to a polite greeting with harsh language describing Advanced Granite Solutions and its workers. Then he tried to talk individually to a few employees.

The man spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Prince is accused of fatally shooting three colleagues and critically wounding two others. Authorities said he then drove to Wilmington, Delaware, and shot an acquaintance at a used car lot. He was captured after a 10-hour manhunt.

A transgender Wyoming woman was convicted Thursday of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl inside a bathroom.

Michelle Martinez, who was known as Miguel Martinez before identifying as female, was found guilty of first-degree and second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and could face up to 70 years in prison.

The Billings Gazette reports Martinez, who is a family friend, invited the girl into the bathroom on March 23, and touched her breasts and genitalia before penetrating her. The girl told her mother immediately after the assault, who then reported it to Casper Police.

It is unknown whether the attack happened in a private or public bathroom.

After the attack, the girl told police “it hurt inside,” according to the Casper Star Tribune.

Nurses at the Wyoming Medical Center performed a sexual assault exam on the minor and found redness and abrasions around the girl’s genitalia.

When police initially questioned Martinez about the assault, she became “noticeably hostile and defensive” and said the girl was “talking crap” before denying being a child molester. Martinez also called the accusations a “publicity stunt,” the Tribune reported.

Martinez pleaded not guilty on both counts.

Tax cuts can't go far enough because Congress won't tackle entitlement abuse

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Consequently, tax cuts are expected to be limited to about $150 billion a year – approximately divided between corporate and personal tax relief, including ending the estate tax, which garners about $17 billion a year.
To make tax simplification politically palatable, the overall revenue take must be reduced more significantly to lower rates more dramatically, or the losers will apply pressure on Congress to kill the reforms.
Spreading around $150 billion in additional rate reductions – less $17 billion to axe the estate tax – is not nearly enough.
On the business side, cutting the federal tax rate from 35 to 20 percent appears to be a big tax reduction and for many it will be.
The same goes for tax simplification.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The Senate has passed its version of the annual budget resolution, which would permit a simple majority to pass a 10-year tax cut of $1.5 trillion. That’s a modest amount – only about three-quarters of 1 percent of our nation’s gross domestic product. But it will prove a heavy lift for Congress to pass because of concerns about multibillion-dollar budget deficits.

Factoring in some revenue gains from increased economic growth, the tax cut that would be permitted in the budget resolution would increase the U.S. budget deficit by no more than one-fifth – likely much less. The basic problem is that tax cuts can’t go farther, owing to legitimate worries about budget deficits. Entitlements are on track to exceed 100 percent of federal revenue within a decade, forcing the government to borrow just to fund day-to-day operations.

The GOP majority in Congress – especially senators like Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski from entitlement-dependent states like Maine, West Virginia and Alaska – refuses to tackle entitlement abuse, putting the borrowing capacity of the U.S. Treasury near its limit.

Consequently, tax cuts are expected to be limited to about $150 billion a year – approximately divided between corporate and personal tax relief, including ending the estate tax, which garners about $17 billion a year. That is not nearly enough money to soothe those whose oxen would be gored by efforts to simplify America’s painfully complex tax code.

Such reforms require eliminating cherished deductions, like those for state and local taxes or domestic manufacturing, to make possible lower rates overall. Keeping the exercise revenue-neutral would create about as many losers as winners. For example, eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes would benefit individuals in low-tax states like Florida and Texas, but raise taxes paid by those in high-tax states likes New York and California.

To make tax simplification politically palatable, the overall revenue take must be reduced more significantly to lower rates more dramatically, or the losers will apply pressure on Congress to kill the reforms. Spreading around $150 billion in additional rate reductions – less $17 billion to axe the estate tax – is not nearly enough.

For example, the deduction for medical expenses exceeding 10 percent of income is likely to be eliminated, and the elderly suffering from Alzheimer’s and other expensive to treat chronic illnesses could face hefty tax increases.

On the business side, cutting the federal tax rate from 35 to 20 percent appears to be a big tax reduction and for many it will be. But eliminating or curtailing interest deductions and special benefits for manufacturers will likely leave many credit-dependent businesses that sell products competing with Chinese imports more disadvantaged than before.

Overall, what matters are the actual taxes paid, and slicing $75 billion off the annual federal corporate taxes would reduce the effective rate by about only one-fifth. Studies by European Union and other tax experts indicate that would still leave U.S. effective tax rates significantly higher than those in other industrialized countries.

Significant incentives would remain for pharmaceutical companies and other businesses earning substantial patent income to flee to Ireland by changing the nationality of their corporate registration via so-called tax inversions.

In fact, by moving to a territorial system – namely taxing the profits earned by U.S. companies on the basis of where those are earned – a significant tax avoidance business could emerge from simply moving research and development activities to locations like Ireland and domiciling patent ownership there if companies can get enough scientists to move.

For many companies, the tax plan would still make it more attractive to locate production and jobs in the United States. That should boost growth a few tenths of a percentage point. However, given the negatives mentioned above, Trump administration claims that the tax cuts would pay for themselves with more private investment and stronger growth are straight out of Alice in Wonderland.

The same goes for tax simplification. The administration proposes to apply a special 25 percent personal rate to limited liability companies (LLCs). For example, the rate would apply to architectural and construction firms organized as LLCs that put up shopping malls and apartment buildings – but not to independent architects and engineers who do smaller projects by subcontracting with various specialty companies.

The same goes for the large real estate holding companies with multiple LLCs for individual properties – but not the home-based real estate investor with 10 units, or the individual who loses his job and creates employment for himself and vendors by setting up a home-based consultancy.

Somehow it would seem that big LLCs – such as JP Morgan Securities or Koch Industries – create jobs, but many smaller businesses are viewed as parasites to be taxed excessively.

And for the latter, the IRS compliance and enforcement apparatus will add a new level of complexity and harassment.

All of this can be accommodated in the inevitable negotiations and compromising that will follow the Trump administration’s initial proposals, but realism must prevail.

Only so much tax relief and simplification can be squeezed out of $150 billion a year.

A North Dakota man living in Georgia was arrested after police got a hold of his diary — which apparently described several instances when he molested children as young as 6 months old, according to reports out Monday.

Timothy Sprenger, 31, was arrested Sept. 22 after a detective with the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia met with someone in June “who presented what appeared to be a diary created by suspect Timothy Sprenger,” MDJ Online reported.

The diary had been ripped up and taped back together, according to the report. It allegedly contained a number of sexual encounters Sprenger had with children, ranging from 6 months to 2 years old.

“After further examination of the document, it appeared that these incidents occurred several years ago in North Dakota,” Sgt. Ashley Henson told the news outlet.

Investigators found two of the children — now both 12 years old — in North Dakota, WXIA reported.

Sprenger confessed to his crimes, as well as other acts that were not documented in his diary, MDJ Online added. It did not say exactly what those other acts were.

Sprenger was extradited back to North Dakota, where he’s been arraigned and is currently being held on $1,000,000 bond in Ward County.

Since the First World War erupted in 1917, one U.S. Army division has been on activation longest, ready to defend the United States and its freedoms. Known as The Big Red One -- from its distinct arm patch - the First Infantry Division has fought in all major American military campaigns of the last 80 years. In this gripping episode of "War Stories with Oliver North," you'll go inside the battlefields of World War I all the way through Operation Iraqi Freedom with those who proudly served in the Big Red One.

You'll hear from veterans who suffered mustard gas attacks in the trenches of Europe. This was the U.S. Army's brutal initiation into 20th Century warfare. You'll go along with the Division as it returns to Europe 27 years later to take on Hitler's elite Panzer Divisions. In that epic struggle, the fighting First Division took part in three amphibious invasions and five major land battles. Barely 20 years later, in the jungles of Vietnam, The Big Red One continued the fight against Communist insurgents. And during 1991's "Operation Desert Storm," the First Division was chosen to breach Saddam Hussein's defenses and take on the dictator's well-trained Republican Guard in the fight to liberate Kuwait.

In this episode, you'll also learn the story of General Terry Allen, the little known, but beloved commander of The Big Red One during its first battles with Hitler's legions. From his granddaughter, you'll hear the inside story of the controversy surrounding General Allen, and the sacrifice made by his namesake son a generation later in Vietnam.

The story of The Big Red One is the history of soldiers in the United States Army. And, in the words of First Infantry Division veterans: "They always say, if you're going to be one, you got to be a Big Red One!"

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
U.S. home sales rose slightly last month as the Houston housing market quickly recovered from Hurricane Harvey. Still, a shortage of available homes is thwarting many would-be buyers and limiting sales.

The National Association of Realtors said Friday existing home sales increased 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million. That's the first increase after three months of declines.

Yet sales have fallen 1.5 percent from a year ago, the first year-over-year decline since July 2016. That's because so few homes are for sale, particularly at lower prices. Buyers have bid up housing costs: The median home price rose to $245,100, up 4.2 percent from a year ago. That's faster than wage gains.

"It's simply impossible to sell more homes when the number of homes for sale keeps falling," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist for housing data provider Zillow. "And the parts of the market most in need of more homes for sale, the low-to-middle segments, are also those experiencing the biggest inventory shortfalls."

Home construction has been slowed by a shortage of available workers, developers say. Home construction fell 4.7 percent last month, partly because of the hurricanes. And many home owners are reluctant to sell with so few other houses available, creating a vicious cycle.

New construction may slow even more in the coming months, keeping inventories low, the Realtors said. Construction workers — and building materials such as lumber — are being diverted to repair and rebuilding work in the aftermath of the storms and the wildfires in California. That should slow new home building and limit the number of homes for sale.

Employers are hiring and mortgage rates remain low, which typically would lift sales. But the number of affordable homes available is falling sharply, according to data from real estate brokerage Redfin. It calculates that the number of newly-listed homes for less than $260,000 plunged 14.9 percent last month from a year ago. New listings priced between $260,000 and $470,000 fell 4.7 percent.

Only homes priced above $470,000 — the most expensive one-third of the market — saw listings actually increase, by 2.3 percent.

The number of homes for sale sank 6.4 percent from 12 months ago to 1.9 million homes, the fewest in any September since the Realtors began tracking the number in 2001.

In Houston, sales rose 4 percent from a year ago after plunging 25 percent in August. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group, said some of that gain may reflect investors purchasing damaged properties.

In Florida, Hurricane Irma sharply lowered sales last month, which were 22 percent lower than a year ago, the Realtors said.

Sales fell more than 15 percent from a year earlier in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, according Redfin. Sales in Miami plunged 38.4 percent.

"The housing market is running on fumes due to low inventory," said Redfin chief economist Nela Richardson. "The inventory shortage is most severe for affordable homes. There has not been an increase in homes priced under $260,000 in two years."

On Friday morning, first lady Melania Trump will donate her inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

The gown, designed by French-American fashion designer Hervé Pierre, will be placed in the museum’s “First Ladies” exhibit alongside several others worn by first ladies throughout American history, including Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Jacqueline Kennedy and Martha Washington.

MICHELLE OBAMA, NOT MELANIA TRUMP, MAKES VANITY FAIR'S INTERNATIONAL BEST DRESSED LIST

Pierre, too, will reportedly be accompanying Trump to the Smithsonian on Friday morning, telling Women’s Wear Daily that he jumped at the chance.

“She asked me if I wanted to be her date, and I said, ‘Oh hell, yes,’” Pierre told WWD. “As a foreigner who became an American, to have your gown put in the Smithsonian Museum is a big huge honor. I got chills. I know how in the designer world, there are lots of big egos. I have always tried to manage my ego for many, many years. But in this case, there is nothing to be ashamed of — it’s a big ego thing. I’m really, really proud of it.”

IVANKA TRUMP SAYS SHE WENT THROUGH A 'PUNK PHASE' IN EARLY NINETIES

In a January interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Pierre said Trump herself contributed to the design of the white, off-the-shoulder dress, picking out a “beautiful six-ply silk” for the construction and specifying the shape of the neckline.



"The lines are as sleek as a paper cut; the curves of the skirt are fluid, yet the overall shape is sharp and intense,” he told the magazine. “For me it reflects her personality.”

According to the Smithsonian, the tradition of first ladies giving over their gowns began in 1912 with Helen Taft, who donated the white silk chiffon dress she wore to her husband’s 1909 inauguration.

The First Ladies exhibit now houses one article of clothing that “belonged to the first lady or the president’s official hostess” from every administration, though “not all are inaugural ball gowns,” the museum writes.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack and is also referred to as “broken-heart syndrome,” The Washington Post reported.
“The kids were grown and out of the house, so she was our little girl,” Simpson, 62, told The Washington Post.
“It was such a horrendous thing to have to witness,” Simpson told The Washington Post.
She was then airlifted to the Memorial Hermann Heart & Vascular Institute – Texas Medical Center, where doctors discovered her arteries were clear, indicating her illness was not a heart attack.
She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and released after two days, and continues to take two heart medications daily, The Washington Post reported.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Doctors were expecting to treat a Texas woman who was mourning the death of her beloved Yorkshire terrier for a possible heart attack, only to discover that her symptoms were actually due to a broken heart. Joanie Simpson, whose 2016 medical ordeal was detailed in the New England Journal of Medicine, was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with the loss of a spouse or child.

The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack and is also referred to as “broken-heart syndrome,” The Washington Post reported. The condition is most common in women ages 58 to 75, and can cause weakening of the left ventricle, according to Harvard Medical School.

For Simpson, who at the time was stressed due to her son’s impending back surgery, her son-in-law’s unemployment and a property sale, it was the loss of the dog named Meha that sent her over the edge.

“The kids were grown and out of the house, so she was our little girl,” Simpson, 62, told The Washington Post.

But when the dog was diagnosed with congenital heart failure, Simpson decided it was best to have her euthanized. She canceled the appointment when the dog seemed to bounce back to health, but Meha died the next day.

“It was such a horrendous thing to have to witness,” Simpson told The Washington Post. “When you’re already kind of upset about other things, it’s like a brick on a scale. I mean everything just weighs on you.”

Sometime after Meha’s death, Simpson woke with back pain that traveled to her chest and went to an emergency room near her Houston home. She was then airlifted to the Memorial Hermann Heart & Vascular Institute – Texas Medical Center, where doctors discovered her arteries were clear, indicating her illness was not a heart attack. She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and released after two days, and continues to take two heart medications daily, The Washington Post reported.

She said she was not surprised by the diagnosis after it was explained to her.

“It is heartbreaking. It is traumatic. It is all of the above,” Simpson said of owning a pet. “But you know what? They give so much love and companionship that I’ll do it again. I will continue to have pets. That’s not going to stop me.”

Senate Republicans narrowly passed a $4 trillion budget plan Thursday, taking their first big step toward a tax reform package promised by President Donald Trump.

Approval of the nonbinding plan allows the Senate to use a special process known as "budget reconciliation" that would forestall a Democratic filibuster.

"Tonight we completed the first step towards replacing our broken tax code by passing a comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget that will help put the federal government on a path to balance," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a failing tax code that holds Americans back with one that works for them."



The Senate plan, approved on a 51-49 vote, calls for $473 billion in cuts from Medicare over 10 years and more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.

If fully implemented, the plan would cut spending by more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years, with an average of approximately $540 billion per year over the life of the plan, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only Republican to vote against the bill, joining all 46 Democrats and two independents.

"I believe her."

That's what Amber Tamblyn revealed Thursday on Twitter after reaching out to actress Charlyne Yi, who accused Tamblyn's husband David Cross of making racist comments years ago.

Tamblyn, 34, has been married to Cross, 53, since 2012.

The controversy began when Yi wrote a series of tweets Monday about the first time she met the comedian 10 years ago:

Cross posted a lengthy note on Twitter in response to the allegations Wednesday. While Cross claimed he didn’t remember the exchange, he did apologize for offending Yi.

“I would never intentionally hurt someone like that,” he explained. “I do not remember doing this when I met her. I do remember meeting her though. She was the then girlfriend of a good friend of mine and we were about to start working on a movie together. I am NOT accusing Charlene [sic] of lying and I’m truly sorry if I hurt her, it was never my intention to do that.”

Cross also thought he was portraying a Southern “redneck character" in a joking matter.

“I have NEVER said ‘ching chong, ching chong’ unless I was doing some a-----e redneck racist character,” he added.

Tamblyn previously supported her husband when a Twitter user reached out to her about the allegations.

While Yi, 31, hasn't commented on her meeting with Tamblyn, the comedienne did hint she felt more at ease after going public with her encounter.

Whether you’re itching for a peaceful weekend getaway or hunting for a new hometown, National Geographic can make that decision a whole lot easier.

Releasing its annual "Happiest Cities in the U.S." list on Oct. 18, NatGeo crowned Boulder, Colo., as the cheeriest place to be. Partnering with Gallup and best-selling travel author Dan Buettner, the group created the list after conducting almost 250,000 interviews with Americans from all over, taking into account several factors including emotional, physical and financial wellness.

“My findings indicate that if you want to get happy, don’t try to change your belief system. Change your environment,” Buettner said in the report.

Lauded for its gorgeous mountain setting, commitment to sustainability and strong sense of community, it’s logical that Boulder citizens would be happy people. The city is also famed for his frontier history, and serves as the home to the main campus of the University of Colorado.

It's not too crowded, either. The population of Boulder — settled in 1858 — currently rests at about 108,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

UNOFFICIAL IN-FLIGHT DATING APP MAKES JOINING MILE-CLUB A WHOLE LOT EASIER

Noting the close correlation between happiness and bike-ability in the rankings, Buettner added that Boulder’s fabulous bicycle access (over 300 miles of dedicated bikeways) certainly boosts its charm.

“In Boulder you’re more likely to hear the whoosh of a cyclist than the shrill of a siren compared to places like Dallas, Tallahassee or Los Angeles. Cities like Boulder question the unquestioned virtues of development,” he said.

The horror. 😉 #KeepBoulderFun #PicNotFromBoulderSorryNotSorry #boulderco #bouldercolorado #boulder #coloradolife A post shared by Boulder Colorado (@bouldercolorado) on Nov 16, 2016 at 8:45am PST

Nevertheless, it takes time and effort to cultivate an all-around happy city, Buettner said.

“There’s a genesis to it. Enlightened leaders make conscious decisions to favor quality of life over economic development or political expediency,” he added.

Rounding out the second, third, fourth and fifith spots on NatGeo's list are: Santa Cruz-Watsonville, Calif.; Charlottesville, Va.; Fort Collins, Colo.; and San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles Arroyo Grande, Calif., respectively.

A fitness company in the U.K. recently came under fire for an advertisement they posted outside of a school, and the owner wasn’t too happy about it.

Skinnypigs Fitness placed a banner outside of a school announcing the more than “100 classes” they offer. The ad features two figures, one heavier and another with a much slimmer silhouette, complete with an arrow pointing from the heavier one to the slimmer one. Next to the images is a bold yellow “CAUTION: Skinnypigs will make you look better naked.”

On Twitter, people took issue with both the message and the location.

BURGER KING GOES AFTER BULLYING IN STRANGE NEW AD

Heather Peacock tweeted, "What element of totally inappropriate shall we say about this SkinnypigsUK?? Put up outside a school?! Come on!!"

Sarah Davy wrote, "That's so shocking in so many ways. Negative body image, inappropriate location & a truly awful company name."

Still another Twitter user accused Skinnypigs of "purporting outdated and dangerous gender stereotypes.”

Skinnypigs owner, Jonathan Hair, was not on board with the attacks his business was receiving, and went on the defensive, resulting in a heated back-and-forth on the social media site.

Hair tweeted from the Skinnypigs handle, “You don't even realise that modern feminism is so polluted with self loathing, man hating looms. We have equality now, it's a good thing. While we are giving advice, stop being a feminazi, you are in the wrong side of history. You'll see when you're all growed up."

Display nothing; This is on Publish with no configured Image Display nothing; This is on Publish with no configured Image

Hair even directly attacked one of his critics, saying, "Thanks for the input, you'd look far less stupid if you looked into what Skinnypigs is and has achieved if you did a little research."

In another he added: "Oooo a feminazi eh, I should have known with the glasses."

He told another critic: "Just another whiny feminazi who will end up bitter and alone with house full of cats (but thinks she can change the world by complaining)."

His responses fueled his opponents’ fire, and many launched more attacks about the perceived fat-shaming sign, and vowed to no longer give business to Skinnypigs.

The Twitter storm swelled to include Skinnypigs die-hards, who came to their favorite fitness center's aid by sharing their own weight-loss success stories.

One Twitter user said, "Getting ready for Skinnypigs, a place [where] we support, encourage and empower each other."

Hair spoke to Mirror Online and defended his responses, saying he had “nothing to be sorry for.”

"It is open season on me at the moment," he said. "To be honest I wish I just ignored it.

"I'm quite worried, I employ 50 people, 48 are women, they are ringing me crying thinking they might not have jobs,” he said. "The people attacking us have no empathy. They don't realize there are real world repercussions, this is people's livelihood."

He continued, saying, "All the hate I was getting, people calling me sexist. I just replied that, over the last seven years, I have helped over 100 women feel better in their own skins, what have you done? I felt like my back was against the wall. It was an online lynch mob. People were just throwing out adjectives.”

Hair did say, however, that his words weren’t as harsh as the attacks on him.

"Everything I said was tongue-in-cheek and I got a lot worse than what I gave by a country mile."

A new Google Maps feature aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle has been removed from the app after sparking backlash.

The tech company recently tested a feature that showed users how many calories they would burn walking from point A to point B, along with a note that equated those calories to mini cupcakes. For example, as Buzzfeed pointed out in one example, a four and a half mile walk would burn around 406 calories: “that’s almost 4 mini cupcakes,” the app reads, alongside a pink cupcake graphic.

FITNESS TRAINER RESPONDS TO FAT-SHAMING AFTER USA TODAY SEGMENT

The feature also included additional info about how those numbers were calculated. “The average person burns 90 Calories by walking 1 mile. To help put that into perspective, we’ve estimated how many desserts your walk would burn. One mini cupcake is around 110 Calories.”

Google began testing this feature with some iPhone users about a week ago, but not everyone was happy with it. While some welcomed it as motivation to walk rather than take a car or public transit, others accused it of being potentially harmful to those with an eating disorder, pointing out that an obsession with calorie-counting can be a warning sign. There was also no opt-out option available, forcing anyone who used the app to see the built-in feature.

"This is reinforcing behaviors that we’re trying to stop when we're treating a patient for an eating disorder," Michelle Lupkin, Ph.D., clinical director of the Eating Disorders Program at Montefiore Medical Center, tells SELF. And, according to Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., codirector of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, using exercise as a way to compensate for calories consumed is a hallmark of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, SELF reports.

In addition to the potentially harmful side effects of the feature, as the Washington Post points out, Google’s measurements of both calories burned and calories per cupcake were questionable. People burn calories at differing rates depending on a number of factors, such as weight and speed at which they’re walking, as Harvard Medical School notes. Plus, for example, a mini cupcake sold at Wegman’s grocery store contains 97.5 calories, while Canada’s Prairie Girl Bakery sells a variety with 200 calories each.

Google confirmed to TechCrunch Tuesday they would be removing the feature “based on strong user feedback.”

The student told deputies form the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office she and the Truman had sex “multiple times” in the high school from March to May 2016, WFTV reported.

A report was filed on Oct. 4 and Truman was placed on leave from Lake Howell High, where she was then teaching, after Child Protective Services called the school, WFTV reported.

The educator resigned from her position at the school Thursday and turned herself in to police the same day, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Officials said Truman was cooperating with the investigation.

Truman was charged with “two counts of lewd acts on a minor student” and was placed in the Seminole County Jail. Her bail was set at $40,000, the sheriff’s office said.

Bob Kealing, the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office spokesman, said Truman taught at a few schools in the Seminole County school district.

Michael Lawrence, the Seminole County Public Schools spokesman, said a background check was done before Truman was hired full-time and the check came back clean.

Poker, foosball and pole dancing. What do these things have in common?

Well, besides being reasonable activities for a night out in Atlantic City, officials who help prepare specific sports for Olympic recognition apparently think they could soon take their place alongside running, gymnastics and ski jumping in the world’s most prestigious athletic competition.

Seriously.

The Switzerland-based Global Association of International Sports Federations earlier this month granted observer status to the International Federation of (Match) Poker, the International Pole Sports Federation and International Table Soccer Federation along with the organizing bodies for four other nontraditional sports — the first step toward joining the Olympic program.

“We warmly welcome our first Observers,” Patrick Baumann, the president of GAISF, said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for them and for us and we will do everything within our remit to help them realize their full potential as International Federations within the global sport’s family and, one day, maybe become part of the Olympic program.”

Baumann added: “The new sports debuting at Tokyo 2020 and at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics are evidence that the pathway is there.”

Joining the program in Tokyo in two years will be softball, karate, surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and baseball — the games’ second shot at Olympic status. These sports were chosen, especially skateboarding and sport climbing, in part to reflect the changing interest in younger athletes and the worldwide popularity of these sports.

"Through these additional events, the Tokyo 2020 Games aims to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said in a statement.

But pole dancing, foosball, aka “table soccer,” and poker?

These barroom pursuits, along with dodgeball, foot golf, kettlebell lifting and the previously mentioned sports, now all have the same status as sports like baseball and surfing once had.

Under the GAISF, observer status allows new sport to grow its base while being guided by the federation toward the requirements of membership, such as receiving the required recognitions by National Olympic Committees, increasing their membership and becoming compliant with the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

And for aspiring poker Olympians, don’t worry, cigarettes and watered-down cocktails are so far not on the list of banned “performance-enhancing drugs.”

So now that they’ve taken the first steps toward Olympic gold, when – or, more importantly, will – these sports make their debuts in the Olympics?

Before anything else happens, the sport needs to be practiced by men in 75 countries on four continents and by women in 40 countries on three continents be considered for the Olympics.

So the men’s division of pole dancing – surely equality demands that there be a men’s division – may run into some issues there.

Besides these stipulations, poker may face the same challenge imposed on chess by the International Olympic Committee with its ban on purely “mind sports.”

And even if dodgeball, foot golf, kettleball lifting, table soccer and arm wrestling can pass these tests, the IOC has worked in recent years to manage the scope of the games by only permitting new sports to join when others are discontinued. Meaning that these athletes might have to wait for sports like curling and table tennis to go the way of tug-of-war and water skiing.

'Little House on the Prairie' cast recall working with Michael Landon

It’s been 43 years since the western drama “Little House on the Prairie” made its grand debut on television – and its stars still insist they’re like family.

The series, which starred Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert, among others, ran until 1983.

“There was no real cast drama because Michael [Landon] would not allow it,” said Alison Arngrim, who played “nasty Nellie,” to Closer Weekly Friday. “I think we are the only cast that never had any arrests!”

The 55-year-old also added, “[Michael] knew exactly what he wanted with every shot and every scene.”

A post shared by @murielfoenkinos on Oct 16, 2017 at 4:37am PDT

Landon’s widow Cindy confirmed the claim.

“If you watch ‘Little House,’ truly it was like watching Michael,” she said. “The love that he had for his family, the type of person he was – it was all apparent.”

Rachel Greenbush, who starred as Carrie Ingalls alongside twin sister Sidney, also had fond memories of working with Landon.

A post shared by @melissawithoutsueanderson on Oct 12, 2017 at 8:35am PDT

“For all the kids’ birthdays, he would have a cake made and throw a little party,” she recalled. “When it was time to work, you had to be focused.”

And while Landon expected hard work from everyone involved in the beloved show, he wasn’t afraid to get out of character to many anyone smile. Greenbush revealed he “was a big practical joker.”

“We used to go with Melissa [Gilbert] to catch frogs in the creek,” she said. “We would bring them back to Michael, and then he would put them in his mouth and walk up to people, open his mouth and the frog would jump out! People would freak out!”

But that wasn’t the only surprise the cast would encounter. The publication added that when production moved from Paramount Studios to MGM in the late ‘70s, they made an unlikely discovery.

“They were ripping up the floor of the set, and what Melissa [Gilbert] and I see, lying beneath, was the Yellow Brick Road [from the 1939 ‘Wizard of Oz’ set]!” said Arngrim. “Melissa and I went nuts. We were dancing around, singing the song, pretending to be Dorothy!”

“Little House on the Prairie” would go on to stay in the top 30 ratings for nearly its entire nine-year run. But when it finally came to an end, Landon was eager to go out with a bang.

“He literally strapped dynamite on all those buildings and blew them to smithereens in one take,” said Melissa Francis, who played Cassandra Cooper Ingalls.

Landon passed away in 1991 at age 54 from cancer of the liver and pancreas. Arngrim previously told Fox News that “Little House on the Prairie” is currently airing in 140 countries and has kept her busy traveling to make appearances, especially in France where the show has a cult following.

A post shared by 🌸Little house on the prairie🌸 (@_littlehousee_) on Jul 20, 2016 at 1:38pm PDT

“When the show first stopped back in the ‘80s, I and a lot of the other actors thought people would stop talking about it… [but] it began rerunning in all the other countries,” she explained. “It didn’t go away, it only escalated.

"I get recognized more now than I did when the show was running… There was a time in my 20s when I would say I didn’t want to be recognized as Nellie forever… but Nellie was a lot of fun to play… Indeed, I thought I’d be sick of it, but now, it just makes me smile.”

The first concert in Atlanta’s shiny new $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium ended in controversy late Thursday night as some fans took to social media to demand refunds, claiming they could not hear country music superstar Garth Brooks.

Attendees of the show were blasting the venue on Facebook and Twitter Friday morning, posting videos of Brooks playing with a significant echo that frustrated fans. Some fans who were sitting close to the stage reportedly left early.

“We sprung a couple hundred bucks to see Garth Brooks at the heavily advertised, much anticipated, and [first ever], concert at this stadium,” a fan wrote in a 1-star review on Mercedes-Benz Stadium’s Facebook page. “We sat in section 125, and we could not hear one word that Garth or Trisha [Yearwood] said or sang. It was extremely disappointing.”

The venue said after the concert that it was looking into the issues.

“Garth Brooks played the first concert tonight at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and it was a spectacular show that tens of thousands enjoyed,” the venue stated. “We have heard some fan concerns about sound quality in certain sections of the upper concourse and sound engineers are looking into that now. We do know that a breaker was tripped that powered speakers in the parts of the upper level for a small amount of time and was resolved.”

The show was being filmed and recorded for a future Brooks live album release.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened in August and is home to the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer's Atlanta United. Ed Sheeran is the next artist scheduled for a concert there.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.

A dad’s funny social media post about life after kids has sparked a viral trend.

Mike Julianelle runs the Instagram account Got Toddlered, where he shares memes and photos featuring “things children have ruined.” But as it turns out, his kids have affected not only his household and his old way of life, but his appearance as well.

FATHER SUPPORTS BREASTFEEDING PARTNER WITH HILARIOUS, SWEET GESTURE

On Oct. 12, Julianelle shared side-by-side photos of himself. One was from 2006, before he had kids, and it shows him looking youthful and rested. In the other one, from 2016, Julianelle appeared unshaven and exhausted.

“Wanna see something REALLY scary? Here’s me, before and after I had kids!” he wrote alongside the images.

The father of two, who has a seven-year-old and almost two-year-old, told HuffPost that after sharing the picture, he got a message from a follower suggesting he ask for submissions from other parents, as well. So Julianelle encouraged everyone to share their “scariest ‘Before and After Kids’ pics” for him to post on the account.

“Let the nightmares begin!” he wrote.



Julianelle has since shared over a dozen before-and-after photos. He said he’s received far more of those submissions than any of the “my toddler destroyed something” memes he previously got.

“Obviously, it’s meant to be lighthearted, and no one is seriously blaming their children for the state of their faces or lives, except for me when I seriously blame my kids for the state of my face and my life, which is basically all I do on my blog and Facebook page and Twitter,” he told HuffPost.

He said he hopes the pictures make people laugh and let parents know they aren’t alone in feeling overwhelmed.

“My blog and everything else have always been about the fact that it’s OK to be honest about the pitfalls of parenthood,” Julianelle said. “There’s no shame in admitting that for all the peaks, there are plenty of pits. Kids are the worst best thing that’s ever happened to us and if we don’t laugh about the havoc they wreak we’d have to cry instead, and I’m not a crier.”

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the importance of passing the budget today so we can move forward with tax reform. Listen to the full interview below:

Chairman Brady on the importance of the budget passing today's vote:

It means everything. This is, the budget gives us the runway to land tax reform on in a big, bold way. Secondly, and I think most importantly, it makes sure that no party including the democrats can obstruct tax reform from getting to the president's desk this year. So it's very simple. No budget, no tax reform. And from a timing standpoint, once that budget is reconciled between the house and senate it's signed, sealed and delivered within 24 hours. We're going to bring forward the Republican tax reform plan and for the first time in 31 years we're going to start action on it.

Chairman Brady responding to Joe Manchin saying he could get six to eight democrats:

I think we do have a lot of common ground with Democrats like Joe Manchin. They want a strong middle class tax cut. They want to stop seeing our jobs go overseas, in fact we want to see them come back here, we deliver exactly that. I wouldn't raise that business rate because it just gives an advantage to China and Europe and our competitors, but I want to continue to work with democrats on how we make our businesses more competitive, especially our main street businesses. You know those small businesses on average they make about $75,000 a year. They work their fingers to the bone. It is a tough slog and they're hiring a lot of our workers. We're continuing in the House in the Ways and Means Committee to continue to work to provide even more help for our smaller business.

Chairman Brady on what's at stake today with the budget vote:

Everything. In my view. One, it's the direction of this country. We cannot stay saddled with this current tax code. We're losing jobs right and left. We've got to change. Secondly, for Republicans you know, how hard is it for us to unite behind President Trump and deliver on our promises? Especially on tax reform. And I think Republicans are not going to disappoint. We are going to get this tax cut done, I predict we're going to get it done this year and it's going to I think transform the U.S. economy.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said he doesn’t think the White House has been “forthcoming” about the deadly attack on American troops earlier this month.

Four U.S. service members were killed on Oct. 4 in Niger by Islamic militants, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns.

From President Donald Trump’s calls to the families of the deceased to the White House’s delayed response to the ambush, details about the attack have drawn intense scrutiny and criticism – and not just from McCain.

What do we know about the attack?

About 50 Islamic extremists attacked a group of American and Niger troops on Oct. 4, killing four American soldiers and wounding two others. Nearly 10 Niger troops were also killed.

The 12-member team was reportedly in unarmored trucks when the ambush occurred. They had just met with local leaders.

No extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it appears to be the work of the Islamic State of the Sahel, a splinter group of extremists loyal to the Islamic State group based in Mali, just across the border.

SANDERS RIPS DEM FOR CALLING NIGER ATTACK ‘TRUMP’S BENGHAZI’

Details about the attack are still few, but the militant group was reportedly new to the area.

Who were the Americans killed?

Sgt. La David Johnson, 25; Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson 39; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, were killed in the attack.

The bodies of some of the Americans killed were recovered by a U.S.-contracted helicopter, a U.S. official told Fox News.

What else should you know?

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that his department is investigating the attack.

“We will look at this and say was there something we have to adapt to now, should we have been in a better stance,” Mattis said. “We need to always look at this. We’re not complacent, we’re going to be better.”

Mattis also dismissed allegations that rescue operations were slow to respond to the attack.

GOLD STAR FAMILIES CAUGHT IN MEDIA FIRESTORM

U.S. Africa Command has launched an investigation into the ambush and will review whether additional security or armed support is needed for these types of missions.

“The patrol that was attacked last week had actually done 29 patrols without contact over the previous six months or so; no indication that this was going to occur. I would say that what was actually very positive about it was the fact that they were able to have close-air support overhead, about 30 minutes after first contact, which is pretty impressive,” the director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., told reporters last week.

Why are troops in Niger?

For several years, American and French troops have provided training and support to the militaries of Niger and other vulnerable African countries where Islamic extremism has grown.

What else?

The White House has been widely criticized for its response to the attack – especially in the delay in acknowledging the ambush. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier this week that the delay in the public acknowledgment of the attack was due to a “process that is standard protocol.”

Trump was also criticized for his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman and Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., accused Trump of making “insensitive” remarks to Myeshia Johnson.

Trump has denied Wilson’s allegations, but the mother of the deceased soldier has backed up Wilson’s claims.

White House chief of staff John Kelly said he was "heartbroken" that Wilson used the conversation she overheard to attack Trump. He added that the president did the best he could in the situation.

"If you're not in the family, if you have never worn the uniform, if you have never been in combat, you can't imagine how to make that phone call," Kelly said.

Because of the White House’s response to the attack, it’s been called “the president’s Benghazi” by some Democrats, referencing the contentious attack in 2012 that left four American service members dead.

Lupita Nyong'o details harassment from Harvey Weinstein: 'I thought he was joking at first'

Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o is the latest celebrity to detail her experience being sexually harassed by disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein following a litany of allegations that include rape and sexual assault.

The “12 Years a Slave” star detailed her experience in a lengthy op-ed to The New York Times, the same outlet that initially wrote an expose that brought Weinstein’s abuse to the forefront of the public conversation.

In it, she details meeting Weinstein while she was still a student at the Yale School of Drama in 2011. After meeting at a social event, Weinstein invited her to a screening of a movie at his private residence in Connecticut, not too far from the Yale campus. After having lunch with him and meeting his young children, they entered his private screening room with a large group. Eventually, he asked her to go to a bedroom with him and propositioned her for a massage.

"I thought he was joking at first. He was not."

The star says she rationalized obliging because massages were something that happened frequently in her acting program to help students understand the mind/body/emotion connection. However, when he insisted on taking off his pants despite her protest, the star insisted that she leave.

After winning her over with a chaste group meeting where Weinstein allowed her to bring two male friends, her guard softened and she agreed to attend another public screening with him months later. Afterward, she was taken to a restaurant thinking it would be a group outing. However, it turned out to be just the two of them. That’s when Weinstein made a blunt proposition.

“Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal,” Nyong’o claims she was told. She refused and they left the restaurant without eating. When she asked if they were OK, Weinstein gave an ominous reply.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he reportedly said.

It wasn’t until she became an Oscar winner in 2014 that Weinstein apologized for his behavior and agreed to show her the respect she deserves. Still, the actress, director and producer says she turned down all future projects from The Weinstein Co.

Nyong’o joins the chorus of voices from women in Hollywood who have shared similar experiences with Weinstein, including reports of massage propositions, unwelcome nudity and threats against their career if they refuse.

Occasionally you know that you are watching history being made. October 5, 2017 was such a day for me.

On that day, Vice President Mike Pence stood before the space shuttle Discovery and called to order the first meeting of the renewed National Space Council. Historians of tomorrow will regard the meeting at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center as the beginning of America’s return as the leader in mankind’s race to explore outer space.

The meeting was of course historic in the literal sense. This was the Space Council’s first meeting in nearly 25 years, since the Clinton Administration disbanded it in 1993.

But this month’s meeting was especially significant for another reason. It signaled a serious change in the way the United States approaches and interacts with space. In addition to attendees from government agencies such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and others, the room at was filled with key people from private enterprise who are currently working to break out and lead the world in space activity.

Karly Venezia told FOX13 she takes her 1-year-old chicken named Loretta paddleboarding in Islamorada because it’s an activity that both of them enjoy on a nice day.

“Loretta is very curious and follows us around the yard, and living in the Florida Keys, we like to get out on the water so it only seemed natural to us to take Loretta paddleboarding and boating and things that we do with our dogs," she said.

Venezia said Loretta isn’t like other chickens and is fond of water-related activities.

“In addition to paddleboarding, we've taken her out boating for sunsets and she always seems to have a great time,” she said.

The pet owner said paddleboarding is “very calming” and gives her quality time to hang out with her chicken.

Venezia added, “She’s an awesome pet to have. For us, I think, coming out here and getting to enjoy the beautiful sunsets is what makes living in the Keys so special.”

One of the Bay Area’s most iconic houses fell victim to the California wildfires late last week.

The home, located at 1700 Twin Sisters Road in Fairfield, Calif., was informally known as Solano County’s “Glass House” thanks to its many floor-to-ceiling windows which also overlooked Napa County.

The property listing at Realtor.com also reveals that the home featured 12,662-square-feet of living space, as well as three bedrooms, five baths, and a pool made of reinforced concrete that spanned both the interior and exterior.

THE OBAMAS POTENTIAL NYC BUILDING WAS SITE OF TWO SUICIDES

Much of the home, however, has been reduced to ashes and debris in the wake of the Atlas Fires that have already claimed 5,700 structures, according to SF Gate.

As seen in footage shared by Bay Area reporter Jodi Hernandez, firefighters worked to save the “Glass House” of Solano County before the fires could reach it, but now it barely resembles the structure it once was.

SF Gate further reports that the house itself was first built in 2003 by John Roscoe, a “tobacco packaging entrepreneur” who spent around $17 million to build the house and purchase the surrounding property. He later became involved in a lawsuit with R.J. Reynolds, who accused him of selling “gray market” cigarettes, and was convicted of fraud in 2011.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE PLAYBOY MANSION?

Property records on Realtor.com indicate that the house was last sold in 2012 for 3,494,000.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he believes all players “should” stand for the national anthem — but stopped short of imposing a rule on standing for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”Goodell, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said it is important for the league and its players to honor and respect “our flag and our country.
“Out of those discussions, [players] understand that owners and the NFL do really care about the issues.”Asked about owners who threatened discipline for players who didn't stand, Goodell said the owners didn't discuss it.
Last week, Goodell sent a memo to NFL executives and club presidents aiming to move past the weeks-long feud between the White House and players.
“The current dispute over the national anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” he wrote last week.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he believes all players “should” stand for the national anthem — but stopped short of imposing a rule on standing for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Goodell, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said it is important for the league and its players to honor and respect “our flag and our country.

“We are not afraid of the tough conversations,” he added. “Out of those discussions, [players] understand that owners and the NFL do really care about the issues.”

Asked about owners who threatened discipline for players who didn't stand, Goodell said the owners didn't discuss it.

A couple hours later, Trump tweeted his thoughts to the NFL in no uncertain terms: “Too much talk, not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem.”

Goodell, who has been in New York City with teams owners for their annual fall meeting, defended the athletes who have been taking a knee in protest, saying they are “not doing this to be disrespectful to the flag, but they understand how it’s being interpreted.”

“We want our players to stand. We’re going to continue to encourage them to stand,” he said.

Last week, Goodell sent a memo to NFL executives and club presidents aiming to move past the weeks-long feud between the White House and players.

“The current dispute over the national anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” he wrote last week. “Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem. It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.”

On Wednesday, Goodell said the league is working with its players to see how it can continue to support them and how changes can be made in their communities.

“They are very clear about and very knowledgeable about [what needs change],” he said.

The “take a knee” movement — protesting police brutality and other issues — began when Colin Kaepernick first sat for the anthem during the NFL preseason in early August 2016.

It since has grown to a sizable number of NFL and WNBA players and even spread abroad when a German professional soccer team took a knee during pregame ceremonies in solidarity last Sunday.

As Willie Shelton fought terminal cancer, his wife says he consistently had only one greatest wish.

"The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

"We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning," said Cheryl.

"What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it," said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

"We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away," said Flinn.

"He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides," said Cheryl.

"Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday," said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

"He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody," said Flinn.

"This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do," said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

"I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything," said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, "a father's love never ends," engraved on the back.

"Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them," said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

"He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something," said Jennifer.​

This year’s Halloween season kicked off with some pretty strange get-ups – from sexy fake news to sexy pregnant Kylie Jenner, there are racy costumes to fit any need.

The latest in that trend is a sexy goldfish, and Twitter is in a tizzy over it.

MOMS WORRY TRICK-OR-TREATING AS 'MOANA' IS 'CULTURAL APPROPRIATION'

The costume – which actually has several iterations available for purchase on line – typically involves some kind of skimpy golden dress or bodysuit. Most of them come with a hood or headpiece of some sort with a fin and two large goldfish eyes. One costume is particular looks more like a golden mermaid than aquarium dweller, Daily Mail shows.

Since the photos of the costumes available started making the rounds on social media, Twitter users have been pretty split about whether or not the costume should exist.

Several are saying there doesn’t need to be a “sexy anything/everything (for women) costumes!”

One Twitter user called it, “This year’s worst costume.”

While another said, “The sexy goldfish gets me every time. The costume no one ever wanted or needed.”

Whereas some seem to be solidly team goldfish.

One user claimed, “It doesn’t need to be Halloween for me to wear a sexy goldfish costume.”

There also some that are on the fence about the suggestive freshwater fish.

Though strange, it’s not quite as divisive a costume as others like sexy Melania Trump or Eleven from “Stranger Things.”

One thing is for sure, this is the perfect costume for those who want an especially carp-y Halloween.

Friday marks the 40th anniversary of one of classic rock music’s greatest tragedies — the crash of the plane carrying the Southern band Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Killed in the Oct. 20, 1977 crash were founder and lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines and his sister, singer Cassie Gaines and members of the plane crew.

Other members of the band survived with various injuries – and eventually reformed the band, with Van Zant’s younger brother, Johnny, as lead singer. (Another brother, Donnie, has long been a member of the band .38 Special.)

The Jacksonville, Fla., band – known primarily for the songs “Freebird” and “Sweet Home Alabama” -- still tours today under the Skynyrd name.

The name was inspired by Leonard Skinner, who was a high school teacher of several band members.

But guitarist Gary Rossington is the only remaining member from the band’s classic lineup. Past members Allen Collins, Billy Powell and Leon Wilkeson have died, and drummer Artimus Pyle is estranged from his former bandmates.

The crash occurred when Lynyrd Skynyrd were nearing the peak of their success. So fans have long wondered what might have happened if the plane crash had never occurred.

The plane was to carry the band from Greenville, S.C., to Baton Rouge, La., but it crashed along the way in Mississippi, the Florida Times-Union reported.

“I think if Lynyrd Skynyrd had lasted, they would have become one of the foundations of American rock bands, much like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers or Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band,” music writer Bill Bentley told the newspaper.

In recent years, the band has recorded new albums and toured on the “classic rock” circuit, playing the old favorites as well as some more recent songs.

This year it has been involved in a legal dispute over a documentary film based on the memories of Pyle, the estranged member. In August, a judge ruled in favor of Rossington and Van Zant’s widow, who wanted the film’s distribution halted.

Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.

Three Maine roofers put their hammers down and stood up to show respect for the national anthem on Saturday, in the process unknowingly posing for a photo that's been used to symbolize one side of the contentious nationwide debate about "The Star-Spangled Banner."

The roofers, who were working near Waterville High School’s football field, stood for the national anthem “even though they didn’t have to,” Michelle Lyons Cossar, the Old Town resident who snapped the photo, told Fox News on Monday.

While Cossar was standing for the anthem prior to the start of Saturday’s game, she said she heard someone in the stands point out the workers had also risen.



“When I looked over the fence, I saw them standing and respecting the flag,” she said.

That’s when she decided to take a picture.

“I just thought the world could use a little more of that right now,” she added.

Cossar’s photo has been shared nearly 600 times as of Monday afternoon.

The three men in the photo are Dwayne Harrison, Danny Thyng, and James Scruggs, according to Cossar.

Harrison, who is on the far right in the photo, told Fox News that standing for the anthem was the “right thing to do.”

“It is a respect thing for myself -- we did not do this to prove a point,” Harrison said, adding that he wasn’t aware that a picture was taken.

Thyng and Scruggs have not responded to a request for comment.

Shanon Gurski Dixon, a resident of Waterville, shared the Cossar’s picture to her Facebook page. She told Fox News she hopes to one day find and thank the men for “being such good role models to our youth.”

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.

As Southwest staffers aboard a Boeing 737 prepared for takeoff on Oct. 18, they looked around and noticed something unusual.

From the pilots to the flight attendants that day, the crew on the new Max 8 aircraft was entirely female.

A Southwest spokesperson told HuffPost that, upon realizing they were the first all-female crew to operate one of the company's new Boeing 737 Max 8 airliners, the women snapped a series of photos of the happy, unintentional event, which the company later shared on Twitter. The airline also confirmed that all the women pictured were employees of Southwest, who were operating a flight from St. Louis to San Francisco.

From a group photo of staffers in the aisle to shots of the two pilots in the cockpit (and also hamming it up in front of an engine), the sweet images clearly struck a chord with the Twitterverse, who blew up Southwest’s post with 20,000 likes and 300 comments. Some praised the airline for celebrating its female staffers, while other bemoaned the fact that all-female flight crews were so scarce that their existence had to be lauded.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
For a stunning and emotional 18 minutes on Thursday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly cut through a nasty debate over condolence calls to Gold Star families, appealing to the political class to allow at least this one thing to remain “sacred.”

Instead, Democratic lawmakers and operatives and allies in the media immediately turned on Kelly – himself a Gold Star father – branding him a liar and an “enabler” of President Trump, even suggesting his criticism of a black Democrat who publicized one of those calls was racist.

“Kelly isnt just an enabler of Trump. He's a believer in him. That makes him as odious as the rest. Dont be distracted by the uniform,” Hillary Clinton’s former spokesman and CNN contributor Brian Fallon tweeted.

“I am stunned by John Kelley's lies about a black woman who he called an 'empty barrel,'” MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell tweeted.

During his appearance in the White House briefing room on Thursday, Kelly tried to reset – and resolve – the unseemly weeklong political war over presidential calls to families of dead American soldiers.

President Trump effectively started that debate after questioning earlier this week whether former President Barack Obama made those phone calls. But Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., escalated the fight when she criticized Trump’s call to the widow of a soldier killed earlier this month in Niger.

Ironically, Kelly seemed to back up a portion of her account – that Trump told the widow that Sgt. La David Johnson “knew what he signed up for.” But Kelly defended Trump’s call and sought to put his words in context – they were a version of what Gen. Joseph Dunford told the retired general when his own son was killed in Afghanistan – and condemned Wilson for both listening to that phone call and talking about it to the press.

Kelly said he was “stunned” and “brokenhearted” that Wilson would do that, adding: “I thought at least that was sacred.”

In response, Wilson said Kelly was just trying to save his job – and joked that she’d have to tell her kids she’s a “rock star” given how much the White House is paying attention to her.

Even after Wilson’s office said they would not be making any further comment “because the focus should be on helping a grieving widow and family heal, not on her or Donald Trump,” the congresswoman appeared on CNN’s “New Day” to accuse Kelly of lying about her.

“It’s a lie,” she said Friday, referring to his criticism of Wilson in 2015 allegedly boasting about getting the funding for an FBI building dedicated to fallen agents. (Wilson said she wasn’t in Congress when that was secured, though she was in Congress for and attended the 2015 dedication. Video of that event released Friday by a Florida newspaper shows Wilson did not talk about the building’s funding, but did talk up her own efforts getting legislation passed naming the building after the fallen agents.)

Further, Wilson claimed that one of Kelly’s terms for her – an empty barrel – was “racist,” even though she also said she hadn’t heard of an empty barrel before.

Kelly has used the term before for other lawmakers.

Meanwhile, Trump lashed out overnight at Wilson again.

“The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!” he tweeted.

And former Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke, highlighting a photo of Wilson in one of her trademark, shiny cowboy hats, tweeted: “.@realDonaldTrump calling Frederica Wilson ‘whacky’ is putting it mildly. The woman is a buffoon. Look at her.”

Kelly, as he left the podium on Thursday, left the media and the public with these words:

“As I walk off the stage, understand there's tens of thousands of American kids, mostly, doing the nation's bidding all around the world. They don't have to be in uniform. … These young people today, they don't do it for any other reason than their selfless sense of selfless devotion to this great nation.”

What's the secret to Dolly Parton's 51-year-long marriage? Keeping her relationship and career separate.

"I've kept [my marriage] very personal and sacred and I try to keep my husband out of the business," Parton told Fox News. "That's not what he chose to do, he just happened to love me and I love him enough to not expose him to it."

When it comes to all other matters, Parton is an open book. Known for her flashy style and sky-high hair, the country singer doesn't shy away from being Dolly.

Parton's goddaughter, Miley Cyrus, recently praised the country legend for not being "afraid to laugh at herself" and for "push[ing] the boundaries for country music."

"I guess [Miley] just meant the way I dress, the fact that I've got boobs and I flaunt them," Parton said of Cyrus' comments. "She meant the tight clothes and being flashy and being proud to be a woman."

In the dusty heart of West Texas, rows of tall white wind turbines and rust-colored working pump jacks bob up and down along the vast rugged landscape.

It’s a visual juggernaut but make no mistake – this is shale country and in this part of the Lone Star State, legends are born and billions are made every single day.

Take Texas natives Cody Campbell and John Sellers, for example. They met in the seventh grade, played football together at Canyon High School and ended up at Texas Tech University.

Campbell went on to the NFL, playing as an offensive guard with the Indianapolis Colts while Sellers made money in real estate.

In 2009, the two friends started Double Eagle Energy Holding, where they signed lucrative land deals on the hoods of their pickups and lived lease-to-lease.

“It was a crazy, very humble starting point for us,” Sellers said. “We were the lowest form of oil guys.”

'It was a crazy, very humble starting point for us.' - John Sellers, Double Eagle Energy Holding co-founder

Six years later, the one-time classmates had built their modest company into a multi-billion dollar behemoth and in 2017 sold 71,000 acres of Permian Basin rights for $2.8 billion. The deal secured both of their spots on the Richest Texans Under 40 list.

American oil legend Mark Papa helped start the U.S. shale boom in the 1990s. In the course of a decade, a $1 investment with him grew to $1,800. He tapped out when the market went bust but came out of retirement at the age of 70 when he saw opportunity in the Permian Basin. In two short years, Papa boosted the value of his new venture, Centennial Resource Development Inc., more than six-fold.

“We’ve got a history of wildcatters who came out and risked everything to try and build the industry,” Stacie Hanna, director of marketing and education at the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum, told Fox News. “We have people with that same kind of outlook and energy out here now.”

'We've got a history of wildcatters who came out and risked everything...' - Stacie Hanna, director of education at Permian Basin Petroleum Museum

Not only has Texas’ role as a petroleum powerhouse created colorful Horatio Alger-esque rags-to-riches stories but it’s also netted billions of dollars and created hundreds of jobs for the state.

Despite some skeptical analysts, the shale industry in the Permian Basin - a 300-mile stretch of open land from West Texas to southeast New Mexico - isn’t showing signs of slowing down.

The prospect of striking it rich is everywhere.

Like so many of the dreamer-turned-tycoon stories the area churns out, success at Permian wasn’t a given. It was born out of grit, determination and hard work. Making it big meant going all in on an area that was a relative latecomer to the shale revolution.

Instead, early success stories belonged to the Barnett Shale formation in the northeastern part of the state. The area was first fracked by pioneer George Mitchell in the early 1990s.

Mitchell put the spotlight on Barnett and the Marcellus Formation in Pennsylvania, and both were largely considered “hot spots” on the shale map. Production in the Permian, by contrast, was just in its infancy.

Permian’s big break came after a handful of oilmen figured out how to crack open shale and find oil. By 2013, Permian was on the top of everyone’s list. Since then, the basin has been at the epicenter of the U.S. shale revival and has become one of the country’s most vital energy producing regions.

Advances in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing – a method of recovering oil and gas from underground shale deposits – have enabled oil companies to dig even deeper into the ground.

It’s also helped the country wean itself from coal and has “reduced emissions dramatically along the way,” Michael E. Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin, said.

In the past five years, output from the Permian has doubled to 2.5 million barrels a day, making it among the most prolific oil and gas producing regions in the nation. The next five years could be even more profitable.

“Texas is far from tapped out,” Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, told Fox News. “Oil and natural gas are limited not so much by supply, but rather by the dynamics of demand, price, technology, public acceptance, energy alternatives at scale, and politics.”

But it isn’t always that easy. Shale has its own set of market-based problems and the industry has gone through its fair share of rough patches.

“We’re used to the ups and downs,” Hanna said. “They're tough, man. They’re really tough. They always have been.”

Still, while other shale patches have petered out, Permian keeps on going. It’s naturally gifted with thick bands of the mudstones that are up to 15 times the diameter of similar patches across the country.

According to an October drilling productivity report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. oil output is expected to increase by 82,000 barrels per day to 6.12 million bpd.

Production at both of Texas’ massive shale oil plays – the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford – are expected to jump. The report predicts oil from Eagle Ford will increase by 2,500 bpd to 1.2 million and forecasts production in the Permian rising by 50,000 bpd to 2.7 million bpd – a new record.

“Here we go again,” Dallas native Lisa Westin, whose family has been in the oil business for decades, told Fox News. “We’re ready for it. Whatever happens, Texas and its people are tough and we know how to handle the ups and downs.”

Lady Bird Johnson's home movies will give you a behind-the-scenes look at three decades of her husband's life. Former speech writer Harry Mcpherson reflects on how Johnson pushed sweeping civil rights reforms and dramatically expanded federal social programs through a reluctant congress. And you'll hear how LBJ got what he wanted by using the legendary "Johnson treatment."

Johnson's gradual escalation of the war in Vietnam divided the country, overshadowed his domestic policies and forever tainted his administration's accomplishments. Racial violence, political assassinations and growing opposition to the war made the 1960's one of the most tumultuous decades in our nation's history. Former secretary of health, education and welfare Joseph Califano recalls how the weight of trying to lead our country through the chaos took a terrible toll on the man who envisioned America as the "great society," and gives you the inside story on the night LBJ went on national television and shocked the nation.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
First lady Melania Trump's office fired back at President Trump's ex-wife Ivana on Monday after she boasted of her access to the White House and even referred to herself as the real "first lady."
In an interview with “Good Morning America” to promote her new book “Raising Trump,” Ivana Trump said she and the president speak “about once every 14 days.”“I have the direct number to White House, but I [don't] really want to call him there because Melania is there,” she said.
Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President.
She loves living in Washington, D.C. and is honored by her role as First Lady of the United States,” Grisham said, slamming Ivana’s book-promotion.

First lady Melania Trump's office fired back at President Trump's ex-wife Ivana on Monday after she boasted of her access to the White House and even referred to herself as the real "first lady."

In an interview with “Good Morning America” to promote her new book “Raising Trump,” Ivana Trump said she and the president speak “about once every 14 days.”

“I have the direct number to White House, but I [don't] really want to call him there because Melania is there,” she said. “I don’t want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I’m basically first Trump wife.”

She added with a laugh: “I’m first lady, okay?”

But Melania Trump’s office said there “is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex.”

“This is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise,” the first lady’s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement to Fox News.

“Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, D.C. and is honored by her role as First Lady of the United States,” Grisham said, slamming Ivana’s book-promotion. “She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.”



In the interview, Ivana went on to share some of the advice she apparently shares with her ex-husband:

“Sometimes I tell him to just not to speak that much, okay?”

When asked about the president’s tweeting habits, and how she would feel if her children -- Ivanka, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. -- used that “language” to describe people, she noted that they were always “very good” and that she never needed to discipline them.

When asked how she would feel if they used the word “loser” to describe someone, she said, “I think they sometimes call people losers. If they are losers, they are losers, okay?”

Will you be able to get an iPhone X at launch?

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Apple's iPhone X might be difficult to find on store shelves when it launches in just a couple short weeks.
Apple's iPhone X was announced at the company's iPhone press event last month alongside the iPhone 8.
Since its unveiling, the iPhone X has become a hot topic, with consumers even ignoring the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus that launched last month in anticipation of the iPhone X's release.
While customers are excited about the prospect of getting an iPhone X, Apple is also having trouble with manufacturing.
Apple's iPhone X units will be going fast.

Apple's iPhone X might be difficult to find on store shelves when it launches in just a couple short weeks.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a note to investors on Friday (Oct. 20) that Apple will only have between 2 million and 3 million iPhone X units available in time for the smartphone's Nov. 3 launch. He believes that by the end of the fourth quarter, Apple's total available iPhone X units will top 25 million to 30 million units, down from a previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million, according to MacRumors, which earlier reported on his predictions.

Apple's iPhone X was announced at the company's iPhone press event last month alongside the iPhone 8. Since its unveiling, the iPhone X has become a hot topic, with consumers even ignoring the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus that launched last month in anticipation of the iPhone X's release.

That lack of demand for the iPhone 8 and widespread demand for the iPhone X might prove to be a problem for Apple. While customers are excited about the prospect of getting an iPhone X, Apple is also having trouble with manufacturing.

In his note to investors, Kuo shed more light on those woes, saying that Apple initially faced problems with a complex circuit board inside the iPhone X and supply chain partner Murata failing to keep pace. After that, Apple had manufacturing problems related to its iPhone X's rear-facing camera, as well as the sensor that will be used to power its Face ID facial scanner.

All of that forced Kuo to reduce his shipment estimates.

However, Kuo also said that the "worst is behind us," according to MacRumors, and he believes Apple is now producing iPhone X units at a much more rapid clip.

But that doesn't mean you'll have a great chance of actually getting an iPhone X. And chances are, supply will be constrained for quite some time.

So, when pre-orders go online next Friday, be ready to act quickly. Apple's iPhone X units will be going fast.

A Las Vegas homeowner’s decision to use Halloween decorations to honor the 58 lives lost in the Oct. 1 shooting rampage near the Mandalay Bay was forced to take it down after it drew community outrage.

The Nevada resident placed 58 tombstones in his front yard with a banner saying “Vegas Strong” hanging on a wall in the background. The tombstones simply read, “R.I.P.” Some had American flags sticking out of them.

But the display drew criticism from neighbors, with some calling insensitive and offensive.

The homeowner, who did not want to be named, said he decided to take it down after hearing people’s complaints.

“He’s a longtime Las Vegas resident, he knows people who were there [at the concert], he has a client whose son passed away, and he wanted to make a tribute,” said Stephen Stubbs, an attorney who is serving as the his spokesman.

He said his client had no ill intention and likened the tribute to the 58 white crosses that were placed near the iconic Las Vegas sign on the Strip.

“As soon as my client knew that anyone was offended, he immediately took it down…there was never any mal-intent, this was meant as a tribute. Personally, I don’t see how it is any different from the crosses at the Las Vegas sign.”

The community had mixed opinions about the homeowner’s choice.

“I thought it was great, awesome, you know, representing the victims that passed away. I’m very disappointed, I don’t know why they had taken it down,” Valarie Irvin, a resident who lives in the same neighborhood, told Fox News.

But another neighbor said the display made her uncomfortable.

"I was trying to understand, you know, what were the intentions,” neighbor Ali Tril told KVVU. “I could see by the Vegas strong sign they had no bad intentions in doing so. But I just felt so unsettled by it."

Stubbs said the criticism was unfounded.

“This is,” he said, “political correctness gone wrong.”

Katy Perry had a small malfunction during her concert in Nashville, Tennessee on Wednesday when she got stuck suspended in the air in front of a massive crowd.

The star can be seen in the video below addressing her crowd from her seat atop a planet that was, presumably, supposed to lower her onto the stage for her next song. Unfortunately, something went wrong and the star got stuck in the air with the crowd gawking at her. Known for her elaborate performances, the future “American Idol” judge had to vamp a bit noting that this was the first time she’d experienced this in her long career.

“This is the first time I’ve been stuck in space,” the 32-year-old singer joked. “You’d better pick your phone up because this is a Youtube-able moment!”

Eventually, the star received word through an earpiece that the crew would be lowering her straight down. While she seemed thrilled at first, she quickly realized that it would be impossible for her to be lowered all the way to the ground without squashing a handful of her adoring fans.

“You know what, I guess I’m just going to have to get down and walk amongst my people. I love this so much,” she said, tentatively standing up. “Should I just like… jump?”

With a roar of approval from the crowd, the video ends with Perry leaping from her platform and safely getting set back down by fans and employees of the venue.

A fan managed to capture the whole event in the video below.

The round of 12 gets underway Sunday in the Monster Energy Cup playoffs.

FOX's Matt Napolitano has more:

It's down to a dozen in the quest for the Cup as the top circuit returns to Charlotte for the Bank of America 500 Sunday. Kyle Busch entering this race weekend in quest of his third straight win, but says momentum doesn't mean anything in the playoffs:

(Busch) "There's a lot of racing to go. You know, I think week to week you can probably change your favorite."

Busch trailing the leader Martin Truex Jr. by 18 points in the playoff standings.

This as one of the final 12 speaks out on pay for drivers. Denny Hamlin sounding off during the week that salary should be on the level of athletes in leagues like the NBA and the NFL:

(Denny Hamlin) "They're risking their life each and every weekend, and they're on the road just, you know, just like everyone else is each and every weekend."

Hamlin speaking with Sirius XM NASCAR Radio there, calling for more revenue from NASCAR's TV deal to be shared with teams.

This as NASCAR unveiled rule changes for 2018 to cars that will see the addition of radiators and common flat splitters for all races, and efforts to increase down-force and horsepower for competitors.

Backyard chicken coop trend linked to spike in salmonella cases

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
More than 1,100 people have contracted salmonella poisoning from chickens and ducks so far this year, with health officials pointing to an increase in backyard coops as the cause.
At least one of the cases has resulted in death, with nearly 250 others requiring hospital care.
“For one salmonella case we know of in an outbreak, there are up to 30 others that we don’t know about,” CDC veterinarian Megin Nichols said.
Nichols said many people raising chickens don’t understand the potential danger, and treat the birds like pets allowing close contact and access to the family home.
Salmonella infection is more widely-known as a food-borne illness, with more than 1 million cases and 300 deaths due to contaminated food recorded each year.

More than 1,100 people have contracted salmonella poisoning from chickens and ducks so far this year, with health officials pointing to an increase in backyard coops as the cause. At least one of the cases has resulted in death, with nearly 250 others requiring hospital care.

The cases span across 48 states, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the number to be far higher than what’s been reported.

“For one salmonella case we know of in an outbreak, there are up to 30 others that we don’t know about,” CDC veterinarian Megin Nichols said.

Nichols said many people raising chickens don’t understand the potential danger, and treat the birds like pets allowing close contact and access to the family home. But poultry can carry salmonella bacteria in their intestines that can be shed in their feces, which could attach to feathers and dust and brush off on shoes or clothing.

YOUR BRAIN KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE JUST DIED, RESEARCHERS SAY

While salmonella can be prevented with thorough handwashing and discarding shoes used in chicken coops outside, some have taken to snuggling or kissing the birds. Nichols said they view the uptick in cases as a preventable health problem, and that the best way to protect against infection is to assume all birds carry the bacteria.

Salmonella infection is more widely-known as a food-borne illness, with more than 1 million cases and 300 deaths due to contaminated food recorded each year.

There are no firm figures on how many households in the U.S. have backyard chickens, but a Department of Agriculture report in 2013 found a growing number of residents in Denver, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City expressed interest in getting them. Coops are now seen in even the smallest yards and densest urban neighborhoods.

MANCHESTER, ONE OF THE MANY EPICENTERS OF OPIOID EPIDEMIC, SAW NEARLY 120 OVERDOSES LAST MONTH

“I think it’s really important to know where your food comes from, but I do think they need to be educated on how to do it safely,” Dr. Stacene Maroushek, a pediatric infectious disease physician in Minneapolis, told the Associated Press. “There are things growing up as a farm kid you know instinctively, but city people don’t know.”

Salmonella can cause flu-like symptoms, including diarrhea, and can pose a more serious risk in children, pregnant women, elderly people and those with compromised immune systems.

“It gets into their blood and it can get into organs,” Maroushek said. “It can be much more significant in people with underlying health problems.”

Let's say China's President Xi Jinping has just delivered a three-hour speech, as he did earlier this week at the Communist Party's congress in Beijing.

You want to applaud the president, perhaps even more than your neighbor does. What can you do?

A Chinese tech company may have the answer. It released a new game this week that challenges people to applaud President Xi as many times as possible in 19 seconds.

The game -- from Tencent, which also produced the WeChat messaging app -- has proved to be a massive success in the wake of Xi’s recent speech, cementing his grip on power. It racked up 1.2 billion plays over just three days, with most players sharingb their scores on social media.

Players are shown extracts of Xi’s speech on subjects such as improved lives of poor farmers or regulating the housing market to ensure the young homebuyers can afford property – and then are asked to applaud by clicking a mobile’s screen.

During the ruling Communist Party’s national congress, the president announced a “new era” of China’s rise in international prestige. It is largely expected that the congress delegates will grant him a second five-year term as party leader next week.

Xi, at age 64, is already among China's most powerful leaders since Mao Zedong, who ruled from 1949 until his death in 1976 at age 82. He accumulated more power than any previous Chinese leader in decades as well as contained the opposition within the party.

His political theory and philosophy is set to be included in the constitution – a move further strengthening the leader’s power and elevating his cult in the Chinese politics. Such honors are normally given to leaders much later in their political life.

The game is just one of the examples of how the authoritarian government tries to use popular and internet culture to foster support for the party and the ruling regime, with particular emphasis on Xi’s cult.

The Chinese government reportedly considered buying stakes in tech companies, including Tencent – the company behind the game. The company was also fined in the past by Chinese regulators for failing to censor certain content shared on their messaging app WeChat.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, "Wolfie's Booth." The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, "Dinner's ready." Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

Aww-dorable.

A Texas girl’s priceless reaction to a birthday gift sent by her deployed father went viral this week in a heartwarming video.

David Villegas of San Antonio, Texas, sent his daughter, Ellianna, a teddy bear dressed as a soldier for her birthday to remember him while he was away in Fort Jackson, SC, for training, KSAT reported.

The sister of Villegas’ wife, Vanessa, captured the moment Elianna opened up her present, which she described, “looked like daddy,” but the real surprise was the message.

Vanessa told Elianna to press on the bear’s paw for a special message.

The bear, with her father's voice, told Elianna: “Hey baby, daddy loves you and misses you so, so much and I can’t wait for you to be in my arms again. I love you very much.”

The little girl’s eyes went wide before squealing in delight, “Oh my God that’s daddy!”

Elianna gave her new soldier teddy bear a big hug.

The touching moment was posted on Twitter by Vanessa’s sister and immediately went viral Wednesday. As of Saturday, the video was retweeted more than 49,000 times and liked by more than 100,000 Twitter users.

“Everyone has been basically saying ‘Oh my gosh I’m crying’ (and) another girl was even like ‘I just put on my makeup and now it’s all over my face,'” Vanessa told KSAT.

“There’s also a lot of people on Twitter saying that they wish they had that from their dad or their mom and if they can hear their loved ones voice one more time, it would have made their entire world,” Vanessa said.

She said David was ordered to travel to South Carolina for basic training in August, leaving the family of three a few weeks to spend together before he left.

“We only had three weeks to spend with him before he had to leave and, of course, we have no contact with him. Basically he’s gone for nine weeks and a couple of days,” Vanessa said. “And after that, he has to go again for longer and so he won’t be back until April (2018).”

Vanessa said the deployment as hard on her daughter who has never been away from her father for this long.

“It really meant a lot to give that to her so she can play it every time she misses him and it helps her a lot,” she said. “It’s tough but in the end, I know it’ll be worth it.”

Vanessa and Elianna plan to travel to South Carolina and visit David in November when he graduates.

College football players, fans sing 'Star-Spangled Banner' after PA system fails

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

It was just another college football game on Saturday in Hartford, Connecticut, until just before kickoff, an announcement came over the loud speakers that there would be no playing of the national anthem.

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

"There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

In fact, Suraci listens to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as sung by Celine Dion every day after he’s done with school.

“I love the Star-Spangled Banner so much because I love America,” Suraci said. “It’s as simple as that.”

Challenge to California's prostitution ban may proceed, judges rule

A federal appeals court gave the go-ahead Thursday to activists seeking to overturn California's 145-year ban on commercial sex.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the plaintiffs' legal challenge against the ban may proceed.
The legal challenge was brought by three ex-prostitutes, a would-be client, and ESPLER (Erotic Service Providers Legal, Educational and Research Project).
They received good news Thursday after the 9th Circuit judges hinted that some scrutiny of the law was needed.
Judge Consuelo Callahan seconded, saying prostitution – like gay sex – had been “subject to moral disapproval.” Because the Supreme Court case dealt with “individual rights,” the right to prostitution could be “a natural extension of Supreme Court precedent,” she said.

A federal appeals court gave the go-ahead Thursday to activists seeking to overturn California's 145-year ban on commercial sex.

A three-judge panel of 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the plaintiffs' legal challenge against the ban may proceed.

The plaintiffs say the current law violates the right to engage in consensual sex, as described in a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that revoked criminal laws against gay sexual acts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

"I believe people in this country have the right to act this way and to make a living this way," attorney Louis Sirkin told a judicial panel, KTVU-TV reported.

California banned prostitution in 1872, defining “every common prostitute” as a “vagrant” subject to a $500 fine and six months in jail. The law slightly changed in the 1960s, the Chronicle reported, by branding prostitution or soliciting prostitution as disorderly conduct, punishable with a $1,000 fine and six months in jail.

The legal challenge was brought by three ex-prostitutes, a would-be client, and ESPLER (Erotic Service Providers Legal, Educational and Research Project).

They received good news Thursday after the 9th Circuit judges hinted that some scrutiny of the law was needed.

“Why should it be illegal to sell something that it’s legal to give away?” Judge Carlos Bea asked, as the Chronicle reported.

Judge Consuelo Callahan seconded, saying prostitution – like gay sex – had been “subject to moral disapproval.” Because the Supreme Court case dealt with “individual rights,” the right to prostitution could be “a natural extension of Supreme Court precedent,” she said.

Deputy Attorney General Sharon O’Grady fired back at the suggestion, saying the difference between the legalization of prostitution and gay sexual activity was “the commercial aspect ... the commodification of sex.”

“The state is not telling anyone who they can sleep with,” she said, but noted that banning prostitution was “an easy place to draw the line" to protect against violence, drug use and trafficking.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White rejected the challenge last year, saying the 2003 Supreme Court ruling was concerning intimate personal relationship and did not apply to commercial sex, adding that California justified the law against prostitution as a deterrence to violence against women, sexually transmitted diseases and human trafficking, according to the Chronicle.

Toyota and its luxury sister brand Lexus took the top two spots in the latest Consumer Reports reliability rankings, marking the fifth year in a row the one of Toyota's makes has led the list.

Kia, Audi and BMW filled out the rest of the top five, while Cadillac, GMC, Ram, Dodge and Volvo were ranked the lowest,

Compaints about infotainment systems and new transmissions plagued the lowest ranked automakers, while Toyota's slow and steady implementation of new technologies paid off with high marks.

Consumer Reports predicts reliability of 2018 vehicles based on a survey of its subscribers, who owned or leased 640,000 vehicles from the 2000-2017 model years. Consumer Reports forecasts how a model will perform based on recent data for that model. The magazine gives more weight to mechanical and safety issues than minor problems like wind noise.

The magazine's rankings are closely watched in the industry, since many buyers seek advice from Consumer Reports.

Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, says Toyota's strategy of adding new technology gradually — instead of all at once — helps make its vehicles more reliable. Toyota's new Camry sedan, for example, has an eight-speed transmission that was first tested on the Highlander SUV.

Kia has also steadily climbed in the rankings because it uses proven technology that has already been tested by its sister brand, Hyundai, which slipped in the rankings. Consumer Reports found that the Kia Niro hybrid, which went on sale earlier this year, was the most reliable vehicle in its entire survey.

Audi and BMW also have better-than-average infotainment systems because they were some of the first to market with them more than a decade ago.

"They've had all those growing pains," Fisher said.

By contrast, Buick dropped from third to eighth in the rankings because of troubles with its new 2017 LaCrosse sedan, which has a new eight-speed transmission, new engine and new electronic shifter, among other features. Fisher said other recent Buicks, like the Envision, went on sale in China or Europe first and got some kinks worked out before heading to the U.S.

Electric cars escaped some of those reliability problems because they have fewer parts. General Motors Co. didn't fare well overall, but its new Chevrolet Bolt electric car had above-average reliability. In its debut on the list, Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 sedan got an "average" reliability score. The car isn't widely available yet, but the magazine based its ranking on responses for the company's Model S sedan, which has above-average reliability.

"There's a lot of stuff that's not in electric cars. They're simpler," Fisher said.

Chrysler was the biggest climber in the rankings, thanks to consumer reviews of its new Pacifica minivan. Acura fell the furthest, hurt by problems with the transmissions on several of its new models.

The legendary Bigfoot and other creatures like it have reportedly been spotted near a Northern California lake, according to a paranormal investigator.

Jeffrey Gonzalez, a self-described paranormal expert, said he heard about the sighting from a local farmer who said he saw the creature and five others running on his ranch near Avocado Lake.

“One of them, which was extremely tall, had a pig over its shoulder," Gonzalez said in comments obtained by Fox 26, a Fox News affiliate. "And the five scattered and the one with the pig was running so fast it didn’t see an irrigation pipe and it tripped, with the pig flying over."

'BIGFOOT' REPORTEDLY SPOTTED IN NORTH CAROLINA FOREST

According to his Facebook page, Gonzalez is a talk show host and an investigator at Paranormal Central, in addition to being a technician at AT&T. He also founded the Sanger Paranormal Society.

Gonzalez said that the sighting is not that uncommon, with three additional Bigfoot sightings in the past five years, all located in East Fresno County.

“I would have never guessed in a million years that you would have told me there were Bigfoot on Shields or Ashlan Avenue. Right? So, I want to know what’s going on. Is this for real?” Gonzalez added.

He recounted two others stories, including one from a woman who said her two sons saw a Bigfoot in their orchard and one from a man who saw five creatures in the same orchard.

“What are the odds of three people, three different families, who don’t know each other, within a radius of 2 to 3 miles, come and tell me what they witness, and it matches up,” Gonzalez said.

The images are reminiscent of the famous Patterson-Gimlin film footage from the 1960s.

In the footage, Roger Patterson and his partner, Robert Gimlin, shot a short motion picture the filmmakers have said was a Bigfoot. Experts have bandied about for years whether the footage was real or fake, though Patterson maintained it was real until his death in 1972.

New York City police went on an un-“bull”-lievable two-hour chase Tuesday after a bull escaped a slaughterhouse in Brooklyn and injured a child when it galloped into a park.

The bull escaped an unknown slaughterhouse and ran into the south side of Prospect Park about 11 a.m., prompting people strolling in the park to dial 911 to have the animal wrangled. A 1-year-old girl was injured when the bull toppled over her stroller, the New York Daily News reported.

“I was with my son Kamren and this cow ran out of Prospect Park and ran over a baby girl,” said Alexis Small, who was in the park when the unusual incident happened. “The mom was just crying and trying to calm her down. She was in such pain, I couldn’t even imagine.”

Police officers scrambled to capture the bull as it continued to run into a car before dashing into the Parade Grounds.

The event even sparked a social media debate on whether the animal was a cow or a bull.

“Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” NYC Parks tweeted.

“Anatomy is incorrect for a cow, that, my friends is a bull. Udders=cow, penis=bull. Collectively=cattle,” one user replied.

Another person tweeted: “This cow is really milking his time in the spotlight..”

Officers tranquilized and wrangled the bull around 1:30 p.m. after it appeared to trap itself between two fences. Officials loaded it into an NYPD truck.

The bull is headed to Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue in Wantage, N.J., where workers have already named the animal "Shankar," according to WABC-TV.

This isn’t the first bull run for New Yorkers.

A bull roamed the streets of Queens in February for about two hours before he was captured. The bull died shortly after. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart even saved another runaway bull last year when he transferred it to a safe haven in Watkins Glen. The bull was captured after wandering into CUNY’s York College campus.

Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.

The spotlight should be on the fallen soldiers who gave their lives for this country.

Instead, we’ve all been plunged into another anguished round of finger-pointing, blame-shifting and all-around nastiness that is nothing short of sad. Everyone is caught in the media crossfire and the deaths of brave Americans have become politicized.

Now there’s no denying that President Trump opened the door at his Monday news conference when he was asked why he hasn’t spoken publicly about the four soldiers killed in Niger. He turned that into a suggestion that Barack Obama and other presidents rarely or never called the families of the fallen, triggering vehement denials from former Obama aides.

The president may not have intended to pick this fight, but the next day he questioned whether Obama had called John Kelly, now his chief of staff, after he lost a son in Afghanistan in 2010. (Obama had not, but invited Kelly, who became a Marine general, to a breakfast for Gold Star families.) Kelly has always been private about the pain of that loss.

Over the past nine months, Donald Trump’s cage match with the Washington press corps has turned into an unedifying national spectacle. Too often, the serious business of the nation has been pushed aside so that the press and Mr. Trump could go tit for tat, like children on a schoolyard. On Thursday, an adult finally stepped into the room.

John Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff and a retired four-star general, addressed White House reporters on this week’s dispute between the press and the President. That is the controversy around Mr. Trump’s call to the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed during an ambush in Niger recently.

As anyone who follows media reports knows, the President’s call to this mother grew into a personal feud between Mr. Trump and a Democratic Congresswoman who disclosed what the President said. It then produced long newspaper reports examining the President’s relationship with every identifiable Gold Star family during his term.

It took awhile for Mr. Kelly to get around to talking about that phone call. Instead, he spent some time offering what we in journalism—or anyone purporting to be engaged in a serious line of work—would call context. Mr. Kelly described what happens when a U.S. soldier or Marine—“the best 1% this country produces”—gets killed in action. What he described was a military process that is graphic, emotionally intense and, most of all, untouchable.

Untouchable, as Mr. Kelly made clear, in the sense that what has happened is so grave, so personal and so difficult that the reality of pushing through it comes down to an encounter between the fallen soldier’s family, the officer who informs them and, in time, support from those who served alongside their son or daughter.

Mr. Kelly explained that a personal call from the President is in fact not what families expect or want. But it has become something of a presidential tradition, and Mr. Trump asked Mr. Kelly what he should say.

The scariest thing this Halloween for New York moms isn’t zombies or ghouls — it’s politically incorrect costumes.

An article on raceconscious.org by Sachi Feris has been making the rounds on mommy Facebook groups. Feris writes that her 5-year-old daughter declared she wanted to be Polynesian Disney character Moana, which she worried would be “cultural appropriation.”

Her daughter’s other choice: Scandinavian Queen Elsa from the Disney movie “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices … about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” she wrote.

Feris went on to describe a series of conversations with her daughter, particularly focusing on the ethics of dressing as Moana, who as a teen sets out on a treacherous sea journey to save her family’s island from famine and destruction — and succeeds.

In the end, Feris’s daughter decided to dress as Elsa — though Feris was concerned it might teach her short-haired brunette daughter that one must be white, blue-eyed and have long flaxen hair to be a “beautiful” princess.

But she nixed the Moana costume for Mickey Mouse, because, as Ferris wrote, “we don’t have to worry about making fun of anyone or dressing up as a culture different from our own because Mickey Mouse is a pretend mouse!

“One thing is for sure, our discussions around appropriate and inappropriate Halloween costumes will continue,” concluded Feris.

Her blog was almost universally praised by commenters. Yvette Brown, wrote: “I admire your perseverance in interacting with your daughter. … You also have given her essential values along with guidelines so she has the opportunity to grow, be creative, learn and find her way in the world.”

But another commenter named Amanda expressed reservations. “This feels murky,” she wrote. “I recognize the need to be sensitive, I’m just wondering how you parse the nuances for a child.”

Meanwhile, a New York mom of one daughter told The Post: “I think it’s silly to take children’s Halloween costumes so seriously. They’re kids, can’t they just be kids and not involved with the whole political correctness thing?

“Parents need to chill out a little bit.”

As firefighters across Northern California work to battle the raging wildfires that have left at least 40 people dead, a group of first responders offered a sign of support last week to fellow rescuers impacted by the flames.
While working mutual aid in Santa Rosa, deputies with the San Mateo Sheriff's Office came across fire crews outside Santa Rosa Fire Department Station 5, according to the San Mateo Organization of Sheriff’s Sergeants.
As fire crews from Station 5 were out fighting the fire the previous night, their station burned down and their American flag was scorched right off the flagpole outside.
The sheriff's organization captured the moment a fire crew from neighboring Contra Costa County brought a new flag to Station 5, and raised it up to the flagpole as a sign of support.
"The weather has not been in our favor over the past week in general, but we are still marching forward with our progress," Daniel Berlant, spokesman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said Monday.

"As so many in the North Bay and beyond are struck by the sadness and devastation of such tremendous loss, it would seem sharing any any small moments of hope are worth that much more," the group wrote on Facebook.

Lighter winds on Monday made it easier to attack the flames, offering crews a better chance to get the upper hand on the inferno that has destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the state's famed wine country.

But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, "Mom Set Free," and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.

Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them.

And Americans have President Trump to thank. From the travel ban to its rejection of the disastrous Iran deal, the Trump administration has prioritized our national security above all else—whether Blow wants to believe it or not.

But to evoke Adolf Hitler—the most reviled dictator in the history of the world—is a bridge too far, even for the New York Times. Mentioning his name in the same sentence as our president is not only intellectually dishonest—which even Blow acknowledges—but also insulting to the innocent civilians who suffered under the Nazi regime and their family members, who continue to cope with the sheer evil of Nazi atrocities.

Not that we need a reminder, but the Holocaust killed as many as 20 million victims overall. Millions more died fighting German forces to liberate Europe from Nazi authoritarianism.

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them. Blow argues our president is next in the line of “powerful leaders [who] use lying as a form of mass manipulation.” Yet the Times columnist provides no examples because he can’t. Even if he could, there is no comparison between a lie and the mass execution of millions of innocent civilians.

Shame on the New York Times for publishing such vitriolic content. It’s no wonder trust in the left-leaning mainstream media is at an all-time low. Less than one-third of Americans express even “a fair amount” of confidence in the media. After months of rabid anti-Trump headlines, only 14 percent of Republicans trust news outlets to do their job. With columnists like Blow in the fold, why would they?

What Americans do trust is the Trump agenda, which will make our country safer and revitalize our economy like never before. President Trump’s approval ratings are highest when it comes to handling terrorism—actual terror, not Blow’s definition—and managing the economy. It’s no coincidence consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2004.

The American people can take pride in a president who champions them, even as liberal snowflakes fan the flames of “resistance.”

A Russian fast-food chain was forced to end its monthlong special offer giving discounts to women based on their breast size.

Dvijok Café posted the discount on their Instagram page with a picture of a woman wearing a black low-cut tank top and holding a long hotdog in front of her chest.

The caption instructed women to: “Say to the cashier – ‘I want a touching discount!’ Then let the cashier take a look at your breasts (no need to get undressed). Get a discount depending on the size. How does it work? Size A - 10%, B - 20%, C - 30%, D - 40%, DD - 50%.”

JAPANESE BAR OFFERING DISCOUNTS BASED ON HIGH HEEL HEIGHT

The offer was for two locations of the hot dog restaurant, including one in Moscow.

The Instagram post was met with an onslaught of negative reactions, with many accusing the company of misogyny and abusing women. One person commented that offers like this urge people to “treat women like pieces of meat.”

But women weren’t the only ones upset over the marketing campaign; men commented on the advertisement saying, “This is just not fair! Where are the discounts for men? What about penis size?” the Daily Mail reported.

Following the outrage, Dvijok dropped the offer and issued a statement on Instagram apologizing for offending anyone.

“Instagram deleted the post about our touching contest because of complaints. We are very sorry if this idea offends anyone. We had a completely different goal,” the post read.

A post shared by ДвижОК (@dvijokcafe) on Oct 18, 2017 at 5:00am PDT

However, the company did try to find a silver lining to their failed promotion, writing in the same post, “But there is also some good news. 48 young women took part in this campaign.”

To try and salvage their reputation with female customers, Dvijok launched a second “movement” after dismantling the big bust discount. This one asked women to give ingredient suggestions for their newest menu item, “the Femen-dog.”

“Men have no right to decide what should be in its composition,” the Instagram post said. “Girls, offer your ingredients in the comments.”

The restaurant followed up with another post on Instagram saying they “got some great recipes, which pleases,” as well as “a lot of aggression that saddens.” Then they listed the winning ingredients, which included “brains," but the fast-food company said “unfortunately [they] can not add brains.”

This comes a few months after a restaurant in China received criticism for offering a similar discount for large chested women.

You'll also meet some of the sailors who, when faced with unbelievable odds and the biggest and best of the Japanese navy, didn't turn and run. Instead they headed straight for what the rules of modern warfare spelled as certain defeat.

Data analyst Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website has tracked how these six Republicans, and other lawmakers, have voted on legislation that supports President Trump’s agenda.
In fact, three of them have voted with Trump’s agenda just as often as Cruz has.
This leads to the key point: 10 of these Democrat-held seats (including the ones held by Manchin and Heitkamp) are in states which President Trump won in 2016.
President Trump would then be in a much stronger position to deliver real change.
Now is the time to support the Trump agenda, not undermine it.

Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is on the verge of becoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s favorite person -- and Donald Trump’s worst enemy.

Bannon’s so-called “war against the GOP establishment,” is the worst strategic action Republicans could take right now. He is planning to find primary challengers for six of the seven Republican senators running for re-election in 2018. Only Senator Ted Cruz has been spared his wrath. Senator Bob Corker’s decision to not seek a third term leaves an eighth Republican-controlled seat open. As I said on Martha MacCallum’s show, “ The Story ” , this week, Bannon’s plan is the wrong strategy.

Every single Senator that Bannon is trying to replace has overwhelmingly supported the Trump agenda: all voted to repeal Obamacare; all supported President Trump’s Cabinet nominations; all supported the American Health Care Act; all supported the so-called Skinny Repeal of Obamacare; and all voted to confirm conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.

While there are many conservatives, myself included, frustrated with the pace of progress in Washington, the data makes it clear that these Senators are not the ones slowing things down:

• John Barrasso - 95.9 percent

• Orrin Hatch - 95.9 percent

• Roger Wicker - 95.9 percent

• Deb Fischer - 91.8 percent

• Jeff Flake - 91.5 percent

• Dean Heller - 89.8 percent

Each one of these Republicans is also very likely to vote for the Trump-Republican tax cut, as well as future legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare. In fact, three of them have voted with Trump’s agenda just as often as Cruz has. Cruz was tracked at 93.9 percent on the FiveThirtyEight website.

At the same time, there are 23 Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 -- as well as two independent Senators who caucus with the Democrats.

All 25 of these left-wing Senators have opposed every attempt to repeal ObamaCare, voted against the American Health Care Act, and only three supported Gorsuch’s confirmation. Among these Democrats, only Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp have supported Trump initiatives more than half the time -- largely out of fear of being voted out of office.

This leads to the key point: 10 of these Democrat-held seats (including the ones held by Manchin and Heitkamp) are in states which President Trump won in 2016. At least six are seriously vulnerable. Does Bannon really think it’s more important to get rid of people like Barrasso and Hatch (who are with the President 95.9 percent of the time) than it is to replace Jon Tester (38.8 percent), Bill Nelson (36.7 percent), or Sherrod Brown (30.6 percent)?

If we are serious about enacting the Trump agenda, we should focus our energy on replacing the Democrats voting against it, not the Republicans voting in favor of it. If Bannon invested the resources at his disposal toward this end, we could potentially gain a 56- or 57-seat pro-Trump agenda majority in the Senate next year. President Trump would then be in a much stronger position to deliver real change.

Bannon should end his war on the GOP. Now is the time to support the Trump agenda, not undermine it.

The spotlight should be on the fallen soldiers who gave their lives for this country.

Instead, we’ve all been plunged into another anguished round of finger-pointing, blame-shifting and all-around nastiness that is nothing short of sad. Everyone is caught in the media crossfire and the deaths of brave Americans have become politicized.

Now there’s no denying that President Trump opened the door at his Monday news conference when he was asked why he hasn’t spoken publicly about the four soldiers killed in Niger. He turned that into a suggestion that Barack Obama and other presidents rarely or never called the families of the fallen, triggering vehement denials from former Obama aides.

The president may not have intended to pick this fight, but the next day he questioned whether Obama had called John Kelly, now his chief of staff, after he lost a son in Afghanistan in 2010. (Obama had not, but invited Kelly, who became a Marine general, to a breakfast for Gold Star families.) Kelly has always been private about the pain of that loss.

Buddy Rich was a relentless perfectionist whose life revolved around making great music and entertaining audiences everywhere. Arguably the greatest drummer that ever lived, this self-taught genius never practiced but instead, played with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Artie Shaw, always making these giants better.

The beautiful island of Cuba, once a hotspot for American tourists in the 1940's and 1950's, is now an oppressed nation of 11 million people governed by a ruthless communist dictator. In this gripping episode of "War Stories with Oliver North," you'll see how Fidel Castro brought a country together with promises and hope, and then tore it apart in one swift grab for power.

You'll witness how Castro committed this ultimate betrayal through a campaign of murder, mayhem and lies to his fellow countrymen. Learn how as a Catholic schoolboy, who once wrote letters to President Roosevelt, Castro rose to command an army of idealistic revolutionaries to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. You'll bear witness to Castro's 1959 victorious entrance into the city of Havana from the man who rode alongside him. In a rare firsthand account, Oliver North interviews Huber Matos, one of Castro's most trusted commanders. Matos was betrayed, tortured and jailed by Castro for 20 years.

You will meet the brave men who fought for the freedom of Cuba only to be abandoned at the last minute by President John F. Kennedy in the debacle known as the Bay of Pigs. You'll go inside the ensuing Cuban Missile crisis and see how a nuclear holocaust was narrowly avoided between America and the Soviet Union. From the pilot himself, you will hear him retrace the mission of a U-2 spy plane that provided the proof the world needed that ballistic missiles were aimed at the United States.

And you'll hear from the ordinary Cuban citizens who fled from their beloved homeland in search of freedom. This is the story of a people who have struggled, fought, and continues to hope for the inevitable day when Cuba will be free again.

Clowns have always been a traditional, albeit time-consuming and slightly strange Halloween costume, but amid a rash of reports of evil jesters cropping up across the country, such outfits are getting close scrutiny.

“If anyone shows up with a clown related costume, they will be asked to change or sent home.”
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
It’s that time of the year again, when the leaves turn, the air becomes crisp and Americans of all ages don masks and costumes to hit the streets in search of sweets, shindigs and maybe a bit of mischief.

But as the U.S. gears up for Halloween, young people are finding that their outfit choices are becoming increasingly limited as institutions from grade schools to major universities clamp down on controversial costumes.

From creepy clowns to Caitlyn Jenner outfits, schools across the country have in recent years issued everything from warnings to bans on costumes that could be construed as inappropriate, publicly incorrect or culturally insensitive.

“This obnoxious undertaking of public shaming is perpetrated by a temperamental culture who engages in it simply to avoid looking at its own inconsistency and ugliness for one more day,” comedian Jim Norton wrote in an opinion piece for Time. “True tolerance would be encouraging people to dress up on Halloween however they wish and if they make fools out of themselves, they would hopefully learn from the embarrassment.”

Tufts University last year threatened investigations by campus police against any student whose costume was deemed offensive, especially if the outfit is thought to be culturally appropriated or “relating to tragedy, controversy, or acts of violence.” Some costumes that have fit that description in the past include geishas, Native Americans, Confederate soldiers or anything involving wearing blackface and/or a sombrero.

The University of Texas handed out a 29-point checklist for avoiding offensive costumes, as noted by The College Fix. It included any “generalized representation” of Asian culture or “Indigenous” cultures, such as “Cowboys and Indians.”

St. Thomas University in Minnesota recently distributed a flier outlining “unacceptable” costumes that included, “Wearing Native American headdresses, dressing up as a ‘Mexican’ by wearing a sombrero, dressing as a ‘geisha,’ any form of blackface.”

Princeton University has planned a seminar with students to “engage in a dialogue about the impact of cultural appropriation, Halloween, and why culture is not a costume.”

While the warnings by universities – some of which are also offering counseling to offended students and encouraging them to report offensive costumes – are nothing new and are meant to create a more tolerant environment, some critics question how far is too far.

“One wonders what’s left,” Robby Soave, an associate editor at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank, wrote last year in the Daily Beast. “Many students who heed the above guidelines are presumably restricted from dressing up as samurais, hombres, geishas, belly dancers, Vikings, ninjas, rajas, French maids, Bollywood dancers, Rastafarians, Pocahontas, Aladdin, Zorro, or Thor.”

Soave added: “Garden-variety Halloween costumes — vampires, zombies, etc. — would seem to run afoul of the prohibition on ‘tragedy and acts of violence.’ And this year’s topical costumes — Harambe, Cecil the Lion, Donald Trump — invoke controversy, so they’re out, too.”

Disaffected minority groups are only one part of the costume crusade. Another type of outfit that schools have taken issue with are ones that are just in bad taste.

The company HalloweenCostumes.com recently pulled an outfit of Holocaust victim Anne Frank from its website after it was hit with a slew of criticism.

“There are more appropriate ways to commemorate the legacy of Anne Frank than through a Halloween costume, which is offensive and trivializes her suffering and the suffering of millions during the Holocaust,” Alexandra DeVitt, a spokesperson for the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, told Fox News. “We are pleased that the costume has been pulled.”

From costumes of murdered teenager Trayvon Martin or ones of Caitlyn Jenner to Bill Cosby groping a woman or Donald Trump grabbing a woman in her private parts, any outfit that addresses rape or violence is a no-go. Some grade schools have gone so far as to ban superhero costumes or ones where a child carries a toy weapon.

“We send out letters a few weeks before Halloween telling parents that their children cannot wear masks or bring weapons of any kind to the school,” said Kenneth Smith, the principal at Strathmore Elementary School in Aberdeen, N.J., told the New York Times. “We know that kids are kids…but times have changed.”

Then there are the creepy clown costumes.

Clowns have always been a traditional, albeit time-consuming and slightly strange Halloween costume, but amid a rash of reports of evil jesters cropping up across the country, such outfits are getting close scrutiny.

Two clowns were spotted in Greenville, S.C., last year trying to lure a young boy into the woods. Later a knife-wielding clown was arrested for allegedly chasing a teenager through a New York City subway station. These were just two incidents of creepy clown sightings across the U.S last year with “killer clowns” popping up everywhere from Florida to Colorado and leading many schools to not clown around with Halloween costumes.

“I am asking for your cooperation in not allowing your children to dress up as clowns at any school event due to the possible disruption and fear it may cause,” Ron Bolandi, the interim superintendent of schools in Montclair, N.J., said, according to the Guardian. “If anyone shows up with a clown related costume, they will be asked to change or sent home.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Researchers at New York University's Langone School of Medicine said in an interview that people who've temporarily died are aware that their life has ended, and might be able to hear a doctor announcing their death.

Scientists at the New York City school told The Independent newspaper that they’re studying patients who've suffered cardiac arrest but have been revived. These doctors say some survivors recall vivid conversations that went on around them — even several minutes after they were pronounced dead.

The paper defined death as the stage where the heart no longer beats and “blood flow to the brain” cuts off. Live Science reported that the cerebral cortex also slows down instantly and within two to 20 seconds flatlines.

“You lose all your brain stem reflexes,” Dr. Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation at the school, told the paper. “Your gag reflex, your pupil reflex, all that is gone.”

The evidence reportedly suggests a surge of brain activity immediately after a near-death experience.

"What tends to happen is that people who've had these very profound experiences may come back positively transformed — they become more altruistic, more engaged with helping others. They find a new meaning to life having had an encounter with death," Parnia said. "But there isn't like a sudden magical enhancement of their memories," he added. "That's just Hollywood jazz."

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
NBC’s “Will & Grace” took another shot at conservatives on Thursday night, using exaggerated stereotypes to portray the right as homophobic with not-so-subtle jabs at Vice President Mike Pence.

Sean Hayes’ character, Jack, explained to Eric McCormack’s Will that he lost touch with his son because, "He moved to Texas, married someone super conservative, and he didn't even invite me to his wedding.”

Upon realizing that he has a grandson in Texas, Will encouraged Jack to bond with him but Sean Hayes’ character didn’t exactly love the idea.

"How am I supposed to connect with a kid from Texas? I can't fish or hunt or tell a woman what to do with her fetus,” he replied.

However, it turns out that Jack might have something in common with his grandson after all, as he is suspected to be gay. He is sent to a mock gay conversion camp called “Straighten Arrow,” where they plan to "pray away the gay," complete with a poster of Vice President Pence.

The Media Research Center’s TV reporter Amelia Hamilton wrote that while conversion therapy is often tied to Pence, "the accusations have just never stuck, except in liberals' minds."

“Anything to keep pushing an oft-debunked myth, I suppose, right?” Hamilton wrote. "Debunked myths, conservative stereotypes, and overwrought situations? It looks like ‘Will & Grace’ knows they're not going to win anybody over by being honest."

Last month, the premiere episode of NBC’s reincarnated “Will & Grace” was essentially a 30-minute anti-Trump infomercial. It referred to First Lady Melania Trump as a “hostage,” portrayed Midwesterners as people who didn’t eat vegetables until Michelle Obama came along and featured Debra Messing’s character, Grace, complaining about the results of last year’s presidential election. People magazine even published a list of all the times the show ripped Trump.

While “Will & Grace” continues to mock conservatives, the creators of the show have actually admitted that they don’t see eye to eye with the man who has turned CNN into a left-leaning network. Creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick told The Hollywood Reporter they only agreed to a reunion because former NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker isn’t involved anymore, as he is now the president of the liberal CNN.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the Iran deal. Listen to the full interview below:

Sen. Cotton on why he chooses not to spar with President Trump like many other Republicans:

The American people elected Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief and if we want to keep our country safe and secure, then it's important that the commander-in-chief succeed, and I think Donald Trump by and large is getting things right. He's certainly much more consistent with decades of bipartisan foreign policy leadership than Barack Obama was for the last eight years. So when the president does things like tells Congress and tells our allies that the Iran deal is not in the United States national security interests, or launches airstrikes against the Assad regime when they cross the U.S. red line, I'm going to support him.

Sen. Cotton on why he was glad the President did not certify the Iran deal:

Iran now is by all accounts about a year away from getting a nuclear weapon. This deal though starts to expire in a mere eight years, sometimes thirteen years with some of the provisions. I don't think we can wait eight to thirteen years. Iran is going to get stronger, it's economy is going to grow, it's going to get more conventional weapons like tanks and artillery and helicopters, and ultimately it will have a nuclear weapon. That's what we saw with the North Korea nuclear deal in 1994. They detonated their first bomb in 2006. So I don't think that we have the luxury of waiting eight to thirteen years to confront a nuclear Iran. I think we need to confront them now. I understand those people who say that we have so many other challenges it's best to kick this one down the road, I just think the consequences are too grave.

If you’re really eager to drink some rare tequily, and you don’t mind ponying up almost eight grand to do so, Patrón’s latest creation could be the drink for you.

For a cool $7,500, you can now treat yourself to a bottle of Patrón en Lalique: Serie 2. The result of a second partnership between luxury French glassmaker Lalique and the tequila company, Patrón en Lalique is descriped as "an exclusive collaboration between the masters of artistry and perfection." It's also a limited edition offering, with only 299 bottles being produced to date.

THIS BAR WAS JUST VOTED THE BEST IN THE WORLD

Aged for an average of seven years, the finely crafted liquor is said to exhibit a “crystalline bright gold” color, and bear an aroma of “fruit, vanilla and oak tastes” in addition to flavors of “sweet honey, fruit, light agave." It's all topped off with a finish of “long lasting oak, agave and fruits,” according to Patrón's website.

And though the blend is made from 100 percent blue agave tequilas and bottled in Mexico’s Hacienda Patrón from American oak, French oak, and Spanish sherry casks, the exclusive drink comes delivered in hand-made, Art Deco-inspired bottles straight from Lalique’s French factory.

Google's artificial intelligence computer 'no longer constrained by limits of human knowledge'

AlphaGo Zero won by 100 games to zero.
The 3000-year-old Chinese game played with black and white stones on a board has more move configurations possible than there are atoms in the Universe.
AlphaGo Zero skipped this step.
Unlike its predecessors, AlphaGo Zero “is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge,” Silver and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis wrote in a blog.
Amazingly, AlphaGo Zero used a single machine — a human brain-mimicking “neural network” -- compared to the multiple-machine “brain” that beat Lee.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The computer that stunned humanity by beating the best mortal players at a strategy board game requiring “intuition” has become even smarter, its creators claim.

Even more startling, the updated version of AlphaGo is entirely self-taught — a major step towards the rise of machines that achieve superhuman abilities “with no human input”, they reported in the science journal Nature.

Dubbed AlphaGo Zero, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system learnt by itself, within days, to master the ancient Chinese board game known as “Go” — said to be the most complex two-person challenge ever invented.

It came up with its own, novel moves to eclipse all the Go acumen humans have acquired over thousands of years.

After just three days of self-training it was put to the ultimate test against AlphaGo, its forerunner which previously dethroned the top human champs.

AlphaGo Zero won by 100 games to zero.

“AlphaGo Zero not only rediscovered the common patterns and openings that humans tend to play ... it ultimately discarded them in preference for its own variants which humans don’t even know about or play at the moment,” said AlphaGo lead researcher David Silver.

The 3000-year-old Chinese game played with black and white stones on a board has more move configurations possible than there are atoms in the Universe.

AlphaGo made world headlines with its shock 4-1 victory in March 2016 over 18-time Go champion Lee Se-Dol, one of the game’s all-time masters.

Lee’s defeat showed that AI was progressing faster than widely thought, said experts at the time who called for rules to make sure powerful AI always remains completely under human control.

In May this year, an updated AlphaGo Master program beat world Number One Ke Jie in three matches out of three.

NOT CONSTRAINED BY HUMANS

Unlike its predecessors which trained on data from thousands of human games before practising by playing against itself, AlphaGo Zero did not learn from humans, or by playing against them, according to researchers at DeepMind, the Google-owned British artificial intelligence (AI) company developing the system.

“All previous versions of AlphaGo ... were told: ‘Well, in this position the human expert played this particular move, and in this other position the human expert played here’,” Silver said in a video explaining the advance.

AlphaGo Zero skipped this step.

Instead, it was programmed to respond to reward — a positive point for a win versus a negative point for a loss.

Starting with just the rules of Go and no instructions, the system learnt the game, devised strategy and improved as it competed against itself — starting with “completely random play” to figure out how the reward is earned. This is a trial-and-error process known as “reinforcement learning”.

Unlike its predecessors, AlphaGo Zero “is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge,” Silver and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis wrote in a blog.

Amazingly, AlphaGo Zero used a single machine — a human brain-mimicking “neural network” -- compared to the multiple-machine “brain” that beat Lee.

It had four data processing units compared to AlphaGo’s 48, and played 4.9 million training games over three days compared to 30 million over several months.

BEGINNING OF THE END?

“People tend to assume that machine learning is all about big data and massive amounts of computation but actually what we saw with AlphaGo Zero is that algorithms matter much more,” said Silver.

The findings suggested that AI based on reinforcement learning performed better than those that rely on human expertise, Satinder Singh of the University of Michigan wrote in a commentary also carried by Nature.

“However, this is not the beginning of any end because AlphaGo Zero, like all other successful AI so far, is extremely limited in what it knows and in what it can do compared with humans and even other animals,” he said.

AlphaGo Zero’s ability to learn on its own “might appear creepily autonomous”, added Anders Sandberg of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University.

But there was an important difference, he told AFP, “between the general-purpose smarts humans have and the specialised smarts” of computer software.

“What DeepMind has demonstrated over the past years is that one can make software that can be turned into experts in different domains ... but it does not become generally intelligent,” he said.

It was also worth noting that AlphaGo was not programming itself, said Sandberg.

“The clever insights making Zero better was due to humans, not any piece of software suggesting that this approach would be good. I would start to get worried when that happens.”

Jimmy Kimmel slammed Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not supporting the New York Yankees, despite the fact that they are one victory from bringing a World Series to the Bronx.

“What’s the deal with your mayor, de Blasio? Is there something wrong with this brain?”

The “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host then played a clip showing how the mayor “celebrates” the success of his city’s baseball team. A local news anchor reported that de Blasio is “such a die-hard Red Sox fan” that he said it would be “physically impossible” for him to support the Yankees, despite the financial and morale boosts that would come with the Fall Classic being played in the city he is expected to oversee.

“I mean I give him credit for honesty, but that might be the stupidest f--king thing I’ve ever heard anybody say,” Kimmel said.

De Blasio is a Boston Red Sox fan and Kimmel’s Brooklyn crowd booed when the late-night host mentioned that New Yorkers voted for him anyway.

“It’s like I don’t even know you anymore,” Kimmel said. “I just want to say congratulations to Bill de Blasio on his final term as mayor of the city of New York.”

ABC’s late-night star was a fairly non-political talk show host for the first 10-plus years of the show's run. That all changed in early 2017 when Kimmel detailed the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo. He explained that many children wouldn’t have the opportunity to survive without the Affordable Care Act, and emerged as an outspoken opponent of the Republican Congress’ attempt to undo it.

The ABC host recently said he “probably wouldn't want to have a conversation” with conservatives when asked if he was afraid of losing right-leaning viewers.

“Three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats. And, then, Republican numbers went way down, like thirty percent, or whatever. And you know, as a talk show host, that's not ideal, but I would do it again in a heartbeat,” he said on “CBS Sunday Morning.”

Kimmel’s shots at De Blasio prove he isn’t opposed to attacking Democrats, although he chose an easy target in the mayor of New York City.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Like many Americans, I find it distressing to see multi-millionaire athletes kneeling during the playing of our national anthem before professional football games. In my lifetime, football has been a big part of our image as Americans.

In my working-class Cleveland, Ohio family, Sunday football was always a big event. One of my cousins was married to Lenny Dawson who would become a Hall of Fame quarterback. It was a rare Sunday during football season when we weren’t gathered around our TV or radio for the Cleveland Browns or the Kansas City Chiefs game (both if possible).

As we watched those games, I had no idea the political affiliation of any of the players and I certainly don’t recall any political discussions during the games (a rarity). We ate, the adults drank, some smoked, and we all felt a part of something both exciting and uniquely American.

I came to love the game. Seeing Jim Brown run down the field is as much a part of my youth as JFK’s inaugural address. I’m not equating their historical relevance. But, both inspired and encouraged my generation regardless of your race, religion or political affiliation. They were simply uplifting.

Employees have no constitutional right to alienate a business’ customer base, damaging the business that employs both them and their co-workers, not to mention the owners who have taken the financial risks to create that business.

In more recent times, I would take my youngest son to Super Bowl games. He was a fan and it was something we could share apart from his siblings. He went on to play on his high school team that had a very successful record in his senior year. I happily worked the chain gang for those games, measuring to see if we had a first down. Football taught my son important lessons about hard work, individual achievement and being part of a team. It was a unique experience. It too was simply uplifting.

I’m not watching professional football anymore. It’s not that I’ve stopped being a fan. I just find it hard to cheer on individuals who have so clearly benefitted from the opportunities our nation offers but refuse to acknowledge the sacrifice of so many Americans who risked or even lost their lives to protect the freedoms we (and they) all enjoy.

Given the uncharacteristically low ratings and empty stadium seats in recent weeks, it appears that I’m not alone. You may or may not like Donald Trump and you may or may not believe he should have gotten involved in this issue. But, as he often does, the president articulated what a lot of Americans were feeling. We simply do not support what these players are doing and, just as they have the right to kneel, we have the right to turn off the games or, like Vice President Pence, we have the right to leave.

The NFL could have prevented this. Honestly, any competent employer would have. Employees do not have the right to alienate a business’ customer base, damaging the business that employs them. As an owner, you can respect your employees’ First Amendment rights without destroying your business. In fact, it could be argued that you are obligated to do so in defense of your other employees - who count on the jobs and incomes you provide - not to mention the investments your shareholders, franchisees or, in this case, team owners all make to build, operate and acquire these businesses.

I ran the company that owns the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurant chains for almost 17 years. Along with our franchisees, we employed about 75,000 Americans and we flew the American flag in front of many of our restaurants. Had any company employees decided to disrespect that flag in front of our customers, in our brand’s uniform and during their hours of employment, I would have encouraged our general managers to first warn them to stop and, if they refused, to fire them.

I am very supportive of First Amendment rights and would encourage employees to express their opinions openly and freely, on their own time. But employees have no constitutional right to alienate a business’ customer base, damaging the business that employs both them and their co-workers, not to mention the owners who have taken the financial risks to create that business. When you accept employment, you accept the responsibility to advance the interests of the business that employs you. You have no right, nor should any employer tolerate attempts, to damage that business by alienating its customer base.

These kneeling player-employees have put their NFL team owners in a difficult spot. On the one hand, they certainly do not want players alienating their customers. On the other hand, team unity is important to a winning season and they naturally want to be sensitive to their players’ concerns. But, they never should have been put in this position.

The NFL has rules as to the decorum players are to demonstrate during the playing of our national anthem. They don’t have to sing along or hold their hands to their hearts (although some notably do). But they do have to show the respect to which our flag and those who have sacrificed for it deserve.

The NFL’s failure to enforce this rule and late to the game efforts to resolve this problem, have hurt the sport. The ramifications of that damage will impact the employees and team owners for some time to come. It’s too bad. A lot of us really enjoyed the game - and our dollars helped pay those multi-millionaires’ salaries.

Editor's note: The following column first appeared in The Washington Times.

As we’ve all been understandably focused on Hollywood’s Weinstein dumpster fire, a number of stories have emerged exposing the left’s continuing culture war, despite its meltdown in the film industry. The Harvey Weinstein saga is but one symptom of a dangerous and destructive, yet smug and sanctimonious, liberal establishment. While they butcher American culture, civil society and history, how better to keep us normals from interfering than by blaming their victims for society’s ills?

Cases in point from the last week, reminding us there are many fronts in our fight to save this nation from the bullies of the pompous left:

Dr. Pamela Gaudry was a passenger on a Delta flight that also carried one of our fallen soldiers. Upon landing, the captain announced that the body of Army Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, who was killed on Oct. 4 in Niger, was on board and asked everyone to stay seated.

A pair of locker keys that belonged to the last surviving member of Titanic’s crew will be auctioned in the U.K. on Saturday.

The keys belonged to Sidney Daniels, a third class steward and member of the doomed liner’s victualing crew. “These were in Mr Daniels's pocket during his escape and subsequent rescue,” Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told Fox News, via email. “These keys are exceptional as they are the only known examples belonging to concurrent lockers.”

Each key has a matching brass tag stamped locker 41 F Deck and locker 42 F Deck on a single ring.

DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC?

Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912 and sank just over two hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives.

After helping women and children into lifeboats Daniels swam away from the sinking ship before reaching an upturned lifeboat. He was eventually taken on board the rescue ship Carpathia, according to Encyclopedia Titanica.

Daniels died in 1983 at the age of 89.

SAILING TO DISASTER: RARE TITANIC PHOTOS UP FOR AUCTION

The lot, which is being sold by a descendent of Daniels, has a pre-sale estimate of $65,772 to $78,927.

Other artifacts up for auction this weekend include two original unpublished photographs of Titanic departing on her ill-fated maiden voyage and an extremely rare sea-stained letter recovered from the body of a Titanic victim.

TRAGIC TITANIC LETTER SURFACES: VICTIM’S SEA-STAINED NOTE UP FOR AUCTION

A number of artifacts from the doomed ship were auctioned in the U.K. last year, with the sextant used by the captain of rescue ship Carpathia selling for just under $97,000. Three photos and a handwritten note detailing the grisly discovery of Titanic’s last lifeboat were sold for $6,800.

Jimmy Kimmel slammed Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not supporting the New York Yankees, despite the fact that they are one victory from bringing a World Series to the Bronx.

“What’s the deal with your mayor, de Blasio? Is there something wrong with this brain?”

The “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host then played a clip showing how the mayor “celebrates” the success of his city’s baseball team. A local news anchor reported that de Blasio is “such a die-hard Red Sox fan” that he said it would be “physically impossible” for him to support the Yankees, despite the financial and morale boosts that would come with the Fall Classic being played in the city he is expected to oversee.

“I mean I give him credit for honesty, but that might be the stupidest f--king thing I’ve ever heard anybody say,” Kimmel said.

De Blasio is a Boston Red Sox fan and Kimmel’s Brooklyn crowd booed when the late-night host mentioned that New Yorkers voted for him anyway.

“It’s like I don’t even know you anymore,” Kimmel said. “I just want to say congratulations to Bill de Blasio on his final term as mayor of the city of New York.”

ABC’s late-night star was a fairly non-political talk show host for the first 10-plus years of the show's run. That all changed in early 2017 when Kimmel detailed the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo. He explained that many children wouldn’t have the opportunity to survive without the Affordable Care Act, and emerged as an outspoken opponent of the Republican Congress’ attempt to undo it.

The ABC host recently said he “probably wouldn't want to have a conversation” with conservatives when asked if he was afraid of losing right-leaning viewers.

“Three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats. And, then, Republican numbers went way down, like thirty percent, or whatever. And you know, as a talk show host, that's not ideal, but I would do it again in a heartbeat,” he said on “CBS Sunday Morning.”

Kimmel’s shots at De Blasio prove he isn’t opposed to attacking Democrats, although he chose an easy target in the mayor of New York City.

The last car has been built in Australia.

After 69 years, General Motors is ending manufacturing in the country, following similar moves made by Ford last year and Toyota just two weeks ago. High costs and low production volumes led them to shift car manufacturing to other countries in the region.

All told, GM’s Holden brand built 7,687,675 cars over the years. The last two to roll off the production line near Adelaide on Friday being a Chevy El Camino-style Commodore Ute and a high performance Commodore SSV Redline V8 sedan. A version of the sedan was imported to the United States for several years, where it was sold as the Pontiac G8 and Chevrolet SS.

A New York City waitress stands accused of swindling nearly half a million dollars from an elderly patron who considered her a friend.

Alicia Legall, 46, was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of grand larceny, identity theft and criminal possession of a forged instrument, with prosecutors saying she stole nearly $480,000 from an 84-year-old widow who frequented Legall’s diner in the Flatlands neighborhood of Brooklyn.

According to the New York Post, Legall first met the elderly customer at the Arch Diner in 2002, eventually befriending the woman and slowly gaining her trust. Over the years, Legall managed some of the woman’s private information, including her Social Security number, address and banking information, officials said.

The elderly woman also allowed Legall to run small errands and do some grocery shopping on her dime, prosecutors say. However, Legall allegedly ended up spending $204,390 of the woman’s money at shops including Apple and Victoria’s Secret, as well as a restaurants and clubs in Florida, the Post reports. She’s also accused of taking out $73,339 in cash advances in the woman’s name and writing herself 75 checks totaling $200,000.

Prosecutors also argued that Legall gambled some of the woman’s money at casinos and racetracks in New York and Atlantic City, N.J.

“[Legall] spent many years gaining the victim's trust only to betray it,” said Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, per the New York Daily News. “We will now seek to hold her accountable for this serious offense."

Legall is currently being held on $2.5 million in bail. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison.

Legall is expected back in court in early December.

School dumps graduation tradition for sake of gender inclusivity

A popular graduation tradition at California’s Camarillo High School is about to come to an end because – well – because the grownups who run the school district are morons.

For as far back as anyone can remember graduates wore gowns reflecting the school colors. The guys wore navy blue gowns and the gals wore blue gowns.

Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives!

But that tradition just got deep-sixed for the sake of gender inclusivity – and now graduates will only be allowed to wear one color that represents all genders.

“This is a very big national initiative,” Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Penelope DeLeon told the student newspaper. “It is not about gender equality as much as it is about being respectful to everybody’s choice to select a gender or not to select a gender, and we have students who choose not to.”

Wait. What?

So, kids now have the option of being genderless? Is that the latest fad among the sex and gender revolutionaries?

The Stinger, in a well-written report, noted that not everyone is on board with the school district’s gender neutral color palate.

“I understand that gender neutrality is a growing topic,” student Drew Reyes told the newspaper. “I just think we could have [found] a solution that allowed us to keep both colors, since they’re both shades of blue.”

Well, that’s not going to happen because the school district is 50 shades of stupid.

“The whole school shouldn’t have to wear one color just to accommodate some people,” student Isaac DeLara told the newspaper.

School staffer Lori Pristera was happy to tackle that question.

“That’s like saying you have three percent of your graduating class who are deaf so we don’t want a sign language interpreter there because that’s not what 97 percent of the students need,” she told the newspaper.

Ironic – seeing how the school district is absolutely tone deaf on this issue.

But there might be a simple fix for students who want to honor tradition and wear gender-specific graduation gowns.

The guys should show up on graduation day wearing navy blue and the girls should wear blue.

If the principal objects, just them tell you are “color neutral.” And as a color neutral student, your navy blue gown actually identifies as a blue gown – or vice versa.

That oughta get the school district seeing red.

Aaron Hernandez had 'horrendous existence' due to CTE, lawyers say

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Aaron Hernandez had a “horrendous existence” because he suffered from the severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that caused his aggressive and explosive behavior, his lawyers said in a refiled lawsuit against the NFL and a helmet manufacturer.
“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.
Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE.
“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.
The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to "disclose, treat or protect" Hernandez from so-called "repetitive impact injuries."

Aaron Hernandez had a “horrendous existence” because he suffered from the severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that caused his aggressive and explosive behavior, his lawyers said in a refiled lawsuit against the NFL and a helmet manufacturer.

The civil complaint filed on Monday accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of football and also named Riddell, the company that previously manufactured the league’s helmets that Hernandez wore when he was playing for the New England Patriots.

“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.

The Hernandez estate also said CTE caused “aggression, explosive behavior, loss of concentration, mood swings, depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment.”

Riddell, an Illinois-based manufacturer, said it intends to vigorously defend its products and its reputation against concussion-related lawsuits

Hernandez hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell in April, five days after he was acquitted of the 2012 double murder of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. He was serving life in prison for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.

Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE. The disease has been shown to cause depression, violent mood swings and other cognitive problems in people.

“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.

The lawyers are seeking the damages on behalf of Hernandez’s 4-year-old daughter. The case was refiled in state court after the federal case was dismissed last Friday. The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to "disclose, treat or protect" Hernandez from so-called "repetitive impact injuries." The Patriots have since been dropped from the lawsuit.

During his early high school years, Hernandez was known as a gifted athlete, but was also seen with a “rough-and-tumble” crowd, the New York Times reported. His father, Dennis Hernandez, kept him grounded until his death in 2006. His mother told reporters that she was worried the death would derail her son’s life.

First look at 8 prototypes of Trump's 'big, beautiful' border wall

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
As workers nearly complete the first prototypes of President Trump’s border wall, next week the Department of Homeland Security will begin testing which designs best deter and prevent illegal immigrants from entering the U.S.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection awarded eight contracts to six companies to build the prototypes. Four are made of reinforced concrete, the others involve alternate materials, mostly steel.

Each model is 18 to 30 feet high and 30 feet long. Contractors have until Oct. 26 to complete their design before testing begins. All of the construction is taking place a few miles east of San Diego.

Testing will include how long it takes to scale the barrier, or breach it using a concrete saw or jackhammer. Do the designs contain sensors? If so, can the prototype alert agents when someone is trying to breach, scale or dig beneath the wall?

Why is that important? Border patrol agents say a fence, wall or barrier – call it what you want – only buys time. Every wall can be breached. Agents need appropriate roads to reach any area along the border in a matter of minutes to interdict or apprehend an individual.

The question for evaluators will be: one, what design works best for the money and, secondly, where is it to be located? What works in the desert, say solid precast concrete, will not work in canyons where there is flash flooding. In that terrain, a design utilizing steel bollards may work best.

Compared to existing fencing along the border, which ranges from 10 feet tall steel mat installed in the 1990s, to 16-foot-tall steel mesh erected in 2006, the new designs at 30 feet tall are imposing.

As for actually getting built, the politics is messy and some lawmakers purposely misinform the public as to what is being proposed.

One, the CBP is not proposing a 2,200-mile-wall from San Diego, Calif, to Brownsville, Texas. That is not realistic, necessary or affordable.

Two, existing law calls for 700 miles of “double fencing.” The U.S. doesn't have that. Under the 2006 Secure Fence Act, the federal government only completed 350 miles of fence, and only in select areas are there two fences.

Many argue, Congress has already authorized another 300 miles of barrier. Whether it’s called a fence or a wall, is politics.

A little boy from New York had his wish granted Tuesday after he got to spend the day practicing and hanging out with his favorite hockey team, the New York Islanders.

Brandon Bloom, 8, of South Setauket, on Long Island, became an NHL athlete for a day, Newsday reported.

The boy was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year. He has been undergoing chemotherapy and will be done with his treatment in August 2018.

BULL WRANGLED AFTER RUNNING LOOSE IN NEW YORK CITY

The special day was set up by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Random Acts of Light Campaign. The campaign’s mission is to “bring light to the darkness of cancer and create awareness for the critical need to find new treatments and cures for blood cancer patients,” according to its website.

Bloom called the day at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow “a dream come true” and revealed he was scared at first but “had a lot of fun.”

Bloom was given ice skates and a custom-made jersey with his name stitched on the back, ABC 7 reported.

The boy was able to perform drills on the ice and shoot a hockey puck with the team’s players. Bloom also scored a goal, which prompted the Islanders to celebrate around their new teammate. One of the players, Casey Cizikas, wrapped up the puck Bloom shot with tape and wrote on it “1st NHL goal” before giving it to the boy.

NEW YORK CITY BRINGS BACK PROBLEM TEACHERS FULL-TIME – FOR NOW

“He’s way stronger than we are. He battles for his life,” Anthony Beauvillier, a member of the Islanders, told Newsday. “Just the smile on his face was worth everything today.”

Stefanie Bloom, Brandon’s mother, said she was grateful for the opportunity.

“We don’t know what each week is going to bring, but moments like this give him that high to help him get through it,” she told Newsday.

Country stars including Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan honored victims of a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas instead of accepting awards at the CMT Artists of the Year show Wednesday night.

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

"We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months," Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. "Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom. We dedicate this night to you and everyone who has experienced loss or tragedy in the last few months."

Aldean closed out the night with a defiant and rollicking group performance of "I Won't Back Down" by Tom Petty with Urban, Stapleton and Little Big Town.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem "Rise Up," in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of "Stand Up For Something."

"On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night," Stapleton said.

"So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment," Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single "Fast," and Stapleton singing his song "Broken Halos," a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad "H.O.L.Y." and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song "Blue Ain't Your Color."

Phillip Phillips added some blues licks to Sam Hunt's mega hit "Body Like a Back Road," which was named song of the year by CMT.

Near the end of the night, Bryan took a moment to honor his friend Aldean.

"It could have been any one of us standing on that stage two weeks ago," Bryan said. "It's a nightmare that nobody should have to face. Jason has responded with dignity, care, respect and, some ways, defiance. And we all proud of him, especially me."

UFC honcho Dana White has a bone to pick with Jason Aldean.

The outspoken UFC president went after the country singer for opting to perform on "Saturday Night Live" over singing the national anthem at UFC 216 in Las Vegas this weekend.

"His image was more important then coming back to Vegas and playing for the people who are his fans and who got shot watching him play," White told TMZ. "F--k you Jason Aldean. Stay out of Vegas."

Aldean performed Tom Petty's "I Won't Back Down" on "SNL" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas last week that claimed the lives of 58 people.

A rep for Aldean had no comment.

The country singer, who was performing onstage at the festival when the shooting began, also returned to Vegas this weekend with his wife to meet with those injured by the shooting at two different hospitals.

Feels surreal being back in Vegas today. Visiting some of the strongest people we have ever met... fighting the toughest battle of them all... for their lives. You have helped us try to begin the healing process by seeing the strength each one of you have. Thank you for today. We will never forget. #vegasstrong 🙌🏼 A post shared by Brittany Aldean (@brittanyaldean) on Oct 8, 2017 at 2:55pm PDT

Before performing Petty's hit song on "SNL," Aldean addressed the audience saying, "Like everyone, I’m struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and start to heal. So many people are hurting. There are children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends. They’re all part of our family.

"So I want to say to them: We hurt for you. We hurt with you. But you can be sure that we’re gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond and our spirit – it’s unbreakable."

White also told TMZ he reached out to several country music stars but they also turned him down.

"Country music was attacked. Those were country music fans," White told the gossip site.

"Those are people who buy your albums and none of you country music people could sing the anthem in front of survivors and 1st responders," White added.

White eventually booked Everlast to perform at his event.

Hannity Moves to 9PM/ET and The Five Returns to 5PM/ET Timeslot

NEW YORK — September 18, 2017 – FOX News Channel (FNC) has named Laura Ingraham as the host of The Ingraham Angle, a new live primetime program to debut on October 30th, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for the network. Ahead of Ingraham’s debut, Hannity, hosted by Sean Hannity, will move to the 9PM/ET hour, the ensemble program The Five will return to the 5PM/ET timeslot, while the 10PM/ET hour will be helmed by rotating hosts during the interim period. Each of these changes will take effect on September 25th.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “We are delighted to unveil this new primetime schedule for both our current and future generation of loyal FNC fans. Over the last decade, Laura’s extraordinary insight, expertise and strong voice have connected with our viewers across the network’s programming.

Martha, Tucker and Sean have proven that they understand the pulse of America across the political and the cultural spectrum. I look forward to informing and entertaining the audience and introducing new voices to the conversation.”

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day. Ingraham will challenge the decision makers to focus on everyday, hard-working Americans who serve as the backbone of the nation. The program will also highlight the importance of faith in our nation and reveal stories that showcase the American spirit.

On Thursday, Business Insider released the results of a joint study with Foursquare that aimed to determine each state’s favorite fast food restaurant, using data obtained from Foursquare check-ins.

There’s just one problem: Plenty of fast-food fans aren’t buying it.

According to the results of the study, Chick-fil-A was found to be the favorite restaurant chain in a total of 39 states, as illustrated in this heavily maroon-tinged map first shared by Business Insider:

“For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” wrote Business Insider, who added that “Chick-fil-A dominates — which isn’t surprising.”

CHICK-FIL-A TESTING NEW 'SPICY' OFFERINGS AT SELECT LOCATIONS

Twitter users were quick to refute the study’s findings, however, arguing that the results don’t actually reflect what people in any given state prefer, and calling the study “nonsense.”

Some also claimed that, in states where Chick-fil-A wasn’t the winner, the restaurants were determined to be a state’s “favorite” weren’t even all that popular.

Media outlets like the Oregonian and the SFGate, too, were unconvinced by the results, with the Oregonian calling them "inconceivably bad" and SFGate saying they've "got issues" with Cane's as California's top choice.

The SFGate also reported that Business Insider removed a Twitter post featuring the map from its timeline.

ALAMABA CHICK-FIL-A CAUGHT IN HILARIOUS FEUD WITH BBQ JOINT

Still other Twitter users took umbrage with the methodology behind the study, which was taken solely from diners who use Foursquare.

But no matter what Foursquare or Twitter has to say, the results of a 2017 report from the American Consumer Satisfaction Index suggest that Chick-fil-A is, in actuality, America’s favorite fast food restaurant. According to its survey, Chick-fil-A was ranked as the top fast food restaurant for a third year in a row in terms of customer satisfaction, scoring 87 out of a possible 100 points on the ACSI’s annual index.

The spotlight should be on the fallen soldiers who gave their lives for this country.

Instead, we’ve all been plunged into another anguished round of finger-pointing, blame-shifting and all-around nastiness that is nothing short of sad. Everyone is caught in the media crossfire and the deaths of brave Americans have become politicized.

Now there’s no denying that President Trump opened the door at his Monday news conference when he was asked why he hasn’t spoken publicly about the four soldiers killed in Niger. He turned that into a suggestion that Barack Obama and other presidents rarely or never called the families of the fallen, triggering vehement denials from former Obama aides.

The president may not have intended to pick this fight, but the next day he questioned whether Obama had called John Kelly, now his chief of staff, after he lost a son in Afghanistan in 2010. (Obama had not, but invited Kelly, who became a Marine general, to a breakfast for Gold Star families.) Kelly has always been private about the pain of that loss.

So now the media had a full-fledged Trump controversy, perfect fodder for cable segments and hot takes online.

Never mind that, with few exceptions, the press provided scant coverage of the deaths in Niger. How many Americans even know why we have troops in Niger?

But now it’s a Trump story, and it’s dominating the entire week.

The president’s call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson became the next flash point. Cowanda Jones-Johnson told the Washington Post that Trump "did disrespect my son."

Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who heard the call, has been all over TV vehemently attacking the president. She says he told Jones-Johnson that her son "must have known what he signed up for." The White House defended the call, with Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling the congresswoman’s conduct "appalling and disgusting." She added that it's "a disgrace of the media to try to portray an act of kindness like that and that gesture, and try to make it into something that it isn't."

An emotional Kelly came into the briefing room yesterday and said he was "stunned" and "broken-hearted" to hear Wilson’s "selfish" criticism of a presidential call that he thought was a fine attempt to say that Johnson died among the best in the country, that this was what he signed up for. "I thought at least that was sacred," said Kelly, adding that he sought solace during a stroll at Arlington National Cemetery.

Obviously, in this climate, the disputed call is news. But let's say Trump stumbled during the call, or meant to say that anyone who goes into the armed forces knows there are risks and we are grateful for his service.

Is the press really whipping itself into a frenzy over how the president made a call that is so difficult to make, trying to comfort a mother who has suffered the ultimate loss?

By the same token, it was news when the Post interviewed Chris Baldridge, the father of an Army sergeant killed in Afghanistan, who said Trump offered to send him a personal check for $25,000—but that the money never arrived. The check was apparently sent after the Post story was published.

But with journalists calling every Gold Star family they can reach—and CNN putting on a grief-stricken relative who didn’t get a Trump call—I have to ask: What other president has been held to this standard?

I'm with General Kelly on this point: the men who died in Niger were heroes. The behavior of just about everyone else in this melodrama has been less than heroic.

Colin Kaepernick hasn’t said much publicly since he stopped being employed as an NFL quarterback.

The last tweet he wrote was on Oct. 10, and it was a shout-out to Eminem for name-dropping him in a long freestyle rap that was extremely critical of President Trump. He has remained active on Twitter though, specifically by re-tweeting several posts per day.

Many of the posts he shared on Wednesday were aimed at NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who addressed the media at the league’s owners meetings in New York. Goodell spoke at length about the national anthem protests, a movement that Kaepernick started last season as a member of the 49ers, saying he wants — but is not mandating — all players to stand for the song, saying he aims to put the number of protesters “at zero.”

“Goodell and his avoidance of police killing unarmed black and brown people is an extension of the coopting/erasure of Kaepernick’s cause,” came a tweet from @LeftSentThis, endorsed by Kaepernick.

“White supremacy is thinking that ending black protest is a better goal than ending the murder of black lives,” wrote @samswey, in reply to Goodell’s goal of reducing the number of protesters, which Kaepernick also retweeted.

Volkswagen is hoping to make some buzz with a battery-powered blitz up a mountain.

The automaker, which just started a major shift towards electric cars, is building an all-electric race car aimed at setting a record at the famous Pikes Peak hill climb next year.

The race against the clock takes place over a 12.4-mile course that climbs up a now fully-paved road to an altitude of 14,100 feet.

The current overall record is held by Sebastian Loeb, who reached the top in an 875 hp Peugeot in just 8 mins 13.878 secs, while the electric car mark was set last year at 8 min 57.118 secs in a purpose-built racer designed by Latvian bespoke EV firm Drive EO.

Volkswagen hasn’t revealed many details about its car, other than a shadowy image of the giant-winged coupe and the fact that it is all-wheel-drive, which likely means it has at least one electric motor at each axle.

Interestingly, the last time VW officially competed at Pikes Peak was in 1987, when it entered a radical twin-engine VW Golf that busted its suspension before it got to the finish.

That’s a score with the mountain VW says it would like to settle.

Robert Engle, 22, an usher with the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ, saw the suspected gunman, identified as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson, and jumped to stop him, according to witnesses.

Engle “physically engaged” with Samson, investigators added. Ultimately the suspect was shot, and Engle suffered a “significant injury around his head” after being pistol-whipped.

Engle then ran to his car, grabbed a gun, and held the gunman at gunpoint until law enforcement arrived, witnesses said.

Later in the day, he released a statement rejecting the “hero” label, adding: “The real heroes are the police, first responders and medical staff and doctors who have helped me and everyone affected.”

Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said of Engle: “He’s the person who stopped this madness.”

Engle’s grandmother, Rheta, told the Tennessean that she’s proud of her grandson Robert.

“That’s like him. He’s just someone who cares about a lot of people. He has all their feelings at heart,” Rheta Engle said. “It would make any parent, grandparent very, very proud of him.”

A friend of Robert’s added that his friend is a “great guy. Just one of the kindest human beings you’ll ever meet.”

Pricing for the iPhone X starts at $999, but most people won't have to pay all of that at once. Carriers will probably engage in a fierce iPhone X pricing war come November, looking to ink as many new subscribers as possible. Not to mention that you can always pay for the iPhone in installments. But even so, you're still going to spend a lot of money for the handset, even if you do it over a certain period, and take advantage of sales and trade-in offers.

But come next year, Apple may have cheaper iPhone X models in stores, and I'm not just talking about the 2017 phone that will cost $100 less than it does now.

A report from Chinese-language Economic Daily says that Apple is working on two iPhone X successors for next year, including high-end and low-end products. These devices are codenamed Lisbon and Hangzhou, respectively.

Apple is reportedly looking to target with the Hangzhou those buyers in China and other markets who are looking for more affordable devices.

It's unclear at this time what a cheaper iPhone X would cost. After all, iPhones are still expensive, and the most affordable 2018 iPhone X might still be costly.

Not to mention that the current iPhone X will likely remain in Apple's lineup once the 2018 models are launched. At that point, it'll sell for $899, assuming Apple sticks to its customary $100 rebate for previous year iPhones.

How will Apple reduce the cost of the 2018 iPhone X? The report does not say. One way would be to cut its margins, but that's something Apple will probably not do.

However, as iPhone X production improves, it may be even cheaper for Apple to mass-produce the iPhone X. I'll also remind you about two distinct reports from January and September that said Apple is working with JDI Display on curved LCD screens. Called Full Active screens, these LCDs could help Apple make a cheaper iPhone X version that would retain all the feature of the original, notch included. The iPhone X's Samsung-made OLED screen is the phone's most expensive component.

I’ve found that most of my friends raised on popular culture’s edicts of materialism and instant gratification are worse off.
In fact, research shows that rates of major depressive episodes amongst millennials continue to increase.
As marriage rates decline, millennials hobble around from relationship to relationship (or worse: hookup to hookup) desperately trying to find purpose.

While correlation doesn’t necessarily prove causation, there seems to at least be a strong connection between faith and emotional health – just as there exists a compelling link between family life and economic stability.

By now, most celebrities have completed their perfunctory condemnation (albeit delayed) of Harvey Weinstein’s actions. The Motion Picture Academy ousted him. Politicians donated his campaign contributions to charity (well, some did). "Saturday Night Live" finally roasted him. Soon, business will return to normal in Hollywood. And that’s the unfortunate part.

Hollywood elites will get back to their pulpits and preach the same message that not only allowed for Weinstein’s behavior, but continues to leave vulnerable Americans insecure and depressed. I’ve found that most of my friends raised on popular culture’s edicts of materialism and instant gratification are worse off. In fact, research shows that rates of major depressive episodes amongst millennials continue to increase.

Church attendance rates may be plunging, but—make no mistake—young people still hear sermons regularly, but we hear them in movie theaters instead of sanctuaries. And the new clerics are Hollywood writers lacing their scripts with the gospel of “do what feels right” and “have it your way.” However, the more we submit to our unrestrained desires, the more we are left with regret and despair.

As the son of a minister, I grew up attending church three to four times a week learning traditional, Christian values. My parents ingrained in me that an individual’s highest call is to serve God, family and country—in that order. They never insulated me from culture, but always warned me to stay leery of the messages I might hear. Fortunately, at age 23, I would still rather listen to one of my father’s lectures than a Jimmy Kimmel monologue any day. But most don’t have that luxury.

If cultural elites genuinely cared, they would introduce other worldviews that might lead to a more fulfilling, joyful life. My friends would hear more about the immeasurable fruits of lifelong commitment and responsibility.

As marriage rates decline, millennials hobble around from relationship to relationship (or worse: hookup to hookup) desperately trying to find purpose. Still, popular culture continues to sing the same tired tune. While my friends are hurting, all Hollywood’s doctrines have to offer are regurgitated lines about “find your own truth” and “discover the god-within.” It isn’t working.

My point isn’t to join the chorus of culture critics bemoaning the “me generation.” To the contrary, if cultural elites genuinely cared, they would introduce other worldviews that might lead to a more fulfilling, joyful life. My friends would hear more about the immeasurable fruits of lifelong commitment and responsibility. If the traditional values of faith and family were given a fair opportunity to compete in the free market of ideas, they wouldn’t be so easily dismissed as relics of the past. In fact, research already seems to vindicate them.

In a review of mental health studies, The Center for Research on Religion and Urban Civil Society found a positive link between religious involvement and greater “happiness, life satisfaction, and morale.” They also found that regular religious practice is associated with individuals having greater hope and a greater sense of purpose in life. There are even links between religious activity and reduced incidences of domestic abuse, crime, substance abuse, and addiction. While correlation doesn’t necessarily prove causation, there seems to at least be a strong connection between faith and emotional health – just as there exists a compelling link between family life and economic stability.

In “The Millennial Success Sequence” recently published by the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for Family Studies, researchers Wendy Wang and W. Bradford Wilcox find that “97% of Millennials who follow what has been called the ‘success sequence’—that is, who get at least a high school degree, work, and then marry before having any children, in that order—are not poor by the time they reach their prime young adult years (ages 28-34).” Their research shows that eight in ten millennials (86 percent) who have followed the sequence are in the middle or top third of the income distribution by ages 28 to 34—while only 29 percent of young adults who missed all three steps are in the middle or upper income groups.

The researchers conclude that millennials are more likely to follow the success sequence if they “have been exposed by family, friends, or members of their social network to norms, aspirations, and expectations that are conducive to education, work, and marriage.” It seems as though one of the greatest hindrances to economic success is culture. Citizens bound to institutions of faith and family seem to be better off emotionally and financially than their peers who subscribe to the teachings of secularism.

My parents gave me the greatest gift a child can receive in an era of uncertainty. They gave me a foundation. In a culture where everything is relative to the individual and lines are blurred, Hollywood leaves my friends navigating through the wilderness of life with nothing more than the broken compass of their own impulses.

Woman diagnosed with 'broken-heart syndrome' after loss of beloved dog

The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack and is also referred to as “broken-heart syndrome,” The Washington Post reported.
“The kids were grown and out of the house, so she was our little girl,” Simpson, 62, told The Washington Post.
“It was such a horrendous thing to have to witness,” Simpson told The Washington Post.
She was then airlifted to the Memorial Hermann Heart & Vascular Institute – Texas Medical Center, where doctors discovered her arteries were clear, indicating her illness was not a heart attack.

Doctors were expecting to treat a Texas woman who was mourning the death of her beloved Yorkshire terrier for a possible heart attack, only to discover that her symptoms were actually due to a broken heart. Joanie Simpson, whose 2016 medical ordeal was detailed in the New England Journal of Medicine, was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with the loss of a spouse or child.

The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack and is also referred to as “broken-heart syndrome,” The Washington Post reported. The condition is most common in women ages 58 to 75, and can cause weakening of the left ventricle, according to Harvard Medical School.

For Simpson, who at the time was stressed due to her son’s impending back surgery, her son-in-law’s unemployment and a property sale, it was the loss of the dog named Meha that sent her over the edge.

“The kids were grown and out of the house, so she was our little girl,” Simpson, 62, told The Washington Post.

But when the dog was diagnosed with congenital heart failure, Simpson decided it was best to have her euthanized. She canceled the appointment when the dog seemed to bounce back to health, but Meha died the next day.

“It was such a horrendous thing to have to witness,” Simpson told The Washington Post. “When you’re already kind of upset about other things, it’s like a brick on a scale. I mean everything just weighs on you.”

Sometime after Meha’s death, Simpson woke with back pain that traveled to her chest and went to an emergency room near her Houston home. She was then airlifted to the Memorial Hermann Heart & Vascular Institute – Texas Medical Center, where doctors discovered her arteries were clear, indicating her illness was not a heart attack. She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and released after two days, and continues to take two heart medications daily, The Washington Post reported.

She said she was not surprised by the diagnosis after it was explained to her.

“It is heartbreaking. It is traumatic. It is all of the above,” Simpson said of owning a pet. “But you know what? They give so much love and companionship that I’ll do it again. I will continue to have pets. That’s not going to stop me.”

Washington is obsessed with the word “collusion” but has little understanding of its true meaning. The confusion might explain why D.C. has missed the big story of collusion between Fusion GPS and the Democratic Party.

To read the headlines, a poor, beleaguered opposition-research firm was humiliated and constitutionally abused this week by partisan Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Fusion’s lawyers sent a 17-page letter to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, accusing him of misdeeds, declaring his subpoenas invalid, and invoking a supposed First Amendment right to silence. Yet the firm’s founders, the story went, were hauled in nonetheless and forced to plead the Fifth. “No American should experience the indignity that occurred today,” Fusion’s lawyer, Joshua Levy, declared.

Leftist protesters interrupted a College Republicans meeting Sunday night in the library at the University of California, Santa Cruz, calling members “fascists,” “racists” and “white supremacists” during a lengthy demonstration that ended in three arrests.

WARNING: VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

Though the College Republicans initially offered to speak to the protesters, those demonstrating refused to leave and demanded instead the Republicans end their meeting. One person in attendance, a Democrat, stood up, however, and defended his right-leaning fellow students.

“I immediately stood up and confronted them,” Phil Leonard told Fox News. “I was the only one to stand up and confront them.”

The school’s director of news and media relations, Scott Hernandez-Jason, expressed disappointment in the episode.

“It’s unfortunate and disappointing that a few students disrupted their meeting and refused repeated requests to leave,” Hernandez-Jason told Fox News in an email. “UC Santa Cruz vigorously supports our students’ rights to peacefully and lawfully assemble.”

The demonstration came about when a far left activist found out the College Republicans were meeting on the ground floor of the library – in a small rectangular room with one entrance and bad cell service – and posted the details to a UCSC Facebook group with nearly 20,000 members, Leonard said.

“They put out a dog whistle for any crazy or deranged person to stop white supremacy,” Leonard said.

A core group of three protesters, joined by a few others, showed up, shouting chants such as “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!”

Leonard said one protester looked at him and told him: “Your existence is a disturbance to every marginalized person in this country.”

“You don’t know who you’re talking to,” he said he responded. “First of all, I’m a registered Democrat. I’ve never voted for a Republican in my life, and I’m here speaking for ideas which is what you’re supposed to do at a college.”

Leonard, a fourth-year politics major, said he started going to College Republican meetings last May when he was working on a piece for his moderate campus publication, City on a Phil, and he started bringing Democrat friends along with him. Leonard said the behavior particularly affected him because he’s Jewish, and he immediately connected the actions of the protesters – seeking to shut down free speech -- with the actions of the Nazis.

“That’s literally how fascists think,” he said. “This kid is literally a fascist.”

Soon, students studying in the library began to complain. A librarian entered and, at one point, asked the College Republicans to leave in an attempt to de-escalate the situation. The group refused, however.

One protester bolted from the room and started running up and down the library stairs shouting about “Nazis” and “white supremacists.”

“I didn’t know who that nutty chick was, but her fliers were all over the school, so when I said her name, she flipped out,” Leonard said. “She flipped out even more when I told her I voted for her [for the Student Union Assembly election].”

When the librarian returned with her boss, the protesters accused her of being a white supremacist. The campus police were eventually called, but the demonstrators still refused to stop the disruption. A black officer showed up and the protesters responded by explaining racism and white supremacy to him, Leonard said.

“Almost all the people in the library, mostly liberal at this point, started getting upset with them, and laughing at them and telling them to leave,” Leonard said. “The whole school and the whole library turned against them.”

Despite attempts by the police to negotiate a peaceful conclusion, Leonard said the protesters insisted on being arrested.

They got their wish. The trio of students were arrested for disturbing the peace, failure to disperse, unlawful assembly and trespassing, Hernandez-Jason said.

Leonard posted video of the incident to the same UCSC Facebook page the protest organizer originally used to plan the demonstration. Other campus groups, many of them liberal, put out statements condemning the actions of the disrupters, Leonard said.

“If there was a social stigma against College Republicans, that stigma is gone now,” Leonard said. “Basically everything the protesters wanted, the exact opposite happened.”

Newt Gingrich: Bannon's strategy will undermine, not strengthen, the Trump agenda

Data analyst Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website has tracked how these six Republicans, and other lawmakers, have voted on legislation that supports President Trump’s agenda.
In fact, three of them have voted with Trump’s agenda just as often as Cruz has.
This leads to the key point: 10 of these Democrat-held seats (including the ones held by Manchin and Heitkamp) are in states which President Trump won in 2016.
President Trump would then be in a much stronger position to deliver real change.
Now is the time to support the Trump agenda, not undermine it.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is on the verge of becoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s favorite person -- and Donald Trump’s worst enemy.

Bannon’s so-called “war against the GOP establishment,” is the worst strategic action Republicans could take right now. He is planning to find primary challengers for six of the seven Republican senators running for re-election in 2018. Only Senator Ted Cruz has been spared his wrath. Senator Bob Corker’s decision to not seek a third term leaves an eighth Republican-controlled seat open. As I said on Martha MacCallum’s show, “ The Story ” , this week, Bannon’s plan is the wrong strategy.

Every single Senator that Bannon is trying to replace has overwhelmingly supported the Trump agenda: all voted to repeal Obamacare; all supported President Trump’s Cabinet nominations; all supported the American Health Care Act; all supported the so-called Skinny Repeal of Obamacare; and all voted to confirm conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.

Data analyst Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website has tracked how these six Republicans, and other lawmakers, have voted on legislation that supports President Trump’s agenda. While there are many conservatives, myself included, frustrated with the pace of progress in Washington, the data makes it clear that these Senators are not the ones slowing things down:

• John Barrasso - 95.9 percent

• Orrin Hatch - 95.9 percent

• Roger Wicker - 95.9 percent

• Deb Fischer - 91.8 percent

• Jeff Flake - 91.5 percent

• Dean Heller - 89.8 percent

Each one of these Republicans is also very likely to vote for the Trump-Republican tax cut, as well as future legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare. In fact, three of them have voted with Trump’s agenda just as often as Cruz has. Cruz was tracked at 93.9 percent on the FiveThirtyEight website.

At the same time, there are 23 Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 -- as well as two independent Senators who caucus with the Democrats.

All 25 of these left-wing Senators have opposed every attempt to repeal ObamaCare, voted against the American Health Care Act, and only three supported Gorsuch’s confirmation. Among these Democrats, only Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp have supported Trump initiatives more than half the time -- largely out of fear of being voted out of office.

This leads to the key point: 10 of these Democrat-held seats (including the ones held by Manchin and Heitkamp) are in states which President Trump won in 2016. At least six are seriously vulnerable. Does Bannon really think it’s more important to get rid of people like Barrasso and Hatch (who are with the President 95.9 percent of the time) than it is to replace Jon Tester (38.8 percent), Bill Nelson (36.7 percent), or Sherrod Brown (30.6 percent)?

If we are serious about enacting the Trump agenda, we should focus our energy on replacing the Democrats voting against it, not the Republicans voting in favor of it. If Bannon invested the resources at his disposal toward this end, we could potentially gain a 56- or 57-seat pro-Trump agenda majority in the Senate next year. President Trump would then be in a much stronger position to deliver real change.

Bannon should end his war on the GOP. Now is the time to support the Trump agenda, not undermine it.

Jimmy Kimmel was your standard Hollywood comedian who had no problem objectifying women for a laugh, long before he was the self-professed moral conscience of America, and some are taking notice.

The country is currently focused on the treatment of women in the entertainment industry on the heels of Harvey Weinstein’s decades-old history of sexual harassment coming to light. Because of this, old footage of Kimmel has resurfaced from before his transformation into the liberal darling of America.

Kimmel was once the co-host of “The Man Show,” which regularly featured bikini-clad women simply jumping on trampolines. This week, a bit from the show circulated in which Kimmel approached women on the street and asked them to guess what was in his pants.

“I’ve stuffed something in my pants, and you’re allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants. You’ll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants,” Kimmel said to a woman he apparently met on the street. “You should use two hands.”

Later in the bit he asked one woman to “put her mouth on it” and made sure another participant was at least 18 years old because, “Uncle Jimmy doesn’t need to do time.”

The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis tweeted in response to the footage, “Just last week CNN declared Kimmel to be ‘America's conscience.’ Oops.”

Even Kimmel’s boss, Disney CEO Bob Iger has taken notice of the fact that the “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host is essentially a comedian-turned-activist who could polarize viewers.

'That show is to entertain… I think he should be careful.' - Disney CEO Bob Iger

“That show is to entertain… I think he should be careful,” Iger recently told The New York Times.

Kimmel emerged as an outspoken opponent of the Republican Congress’ attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act and was even thanked by many liberals when the bill was eventually killed. He recently delivered a monologue regarding the mass shooting in Las Vegas and teared up when he discussed what occurred in his hometown. However, he has been largely silent when it comes to Weinstein – perhaps because he has a ton of clips floating around the Internet that appear crude and sexist.

Other popular segments on “The Man Show” include a mock commercial for “Bosom Springs,” a spoof beverage company billed as the water for “wet T-shirts,” and a visit to Snoop Dogg’s house in which Kimmel pointed out that a statue of a female was “just the right height” while he thrusted his groin toward it. The show even featured a “Juggy Talent Show” in which women dressed in bathing suits demonstrated their unique “talents,” such as fitting an entire banana in their mouth.

“The Man Show” featured so many things that most Americans would find offensive in the modern cultural landscape that it’s impossible to name them all. A quick YouTube search reveals Kimmel asking to see people on the street’s underwear, stuffing his pants to make himself appear well endowed and even asking porn stars for household hints on things such as how to get wine out of a wet T-shirt.

“Make sure you get it really wet,” an adult film star said while pouring liquid on herself.

“The Man Show” was created by Kimmel and fellow comedian Adam Carolla and they starred on the Comedy Central program from 1999 until 2003. When Kimmel wasn’t making sexist jokes during that time, he was often in blackface make-up impersonating African-American NBA legend Karl Malone. Kimmel left and soon after landed at ABC, where he cleaned up his act and started hosting “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”

ABC’s late-night star was a fairly run-of-the-mill, non-political talk show host for the first 10-plus years of the show's run, famous for pulling practical jokes on celebrities and having Hollywood elite read mean tweets about themselves. One of the show’s more notable segments involved Kimmel joking that he was “f***ing Ben Affleck,” who recently had to apologize for his own groping scandal.

It all changed in early 2017 when Kimmel detailed the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo. He explained that many children wouldn’t have the opportunity to survive without the Affordable Care Act. Mediaite columnist Joseph A. Wulfsohn asked why the ABC host hasn’t delivered an “emotional monologue on sexual harassment in Hollywood.”

“He cries that everyone should have health care and that guns are the problem without providing any real solutions, yet he’s silent on the out-of-control abuse women have faced in showbiz for years,” Wulfsohn wrote. “He’s a coward.”

Occasionally you know that you are watching history being made. October 5, 2017 was such a day for me.

On that day, Vice President Mike Pence stood before the space shuttle Discovery and called to order the first meeting of the renewed National Space Council. Historians of tomorrow will regard the meeting at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center as the beginning of America’s return as the leader in mankind’s race to explore outer space.

The meeting was of course historic in the literal sense. This was the Space Council’s first meeting in nearly 25 years, since the Clinton Administration disbanded it in 1993.

But this month’s meeting was especially significant for another reason. It signaled a serious change in the way the United States approaches and interacts with space. In addition to attendees from government agencies such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and others, the room at was filled with key people from private enterprise who are currently working to break out and lead the world in space activity.

"[B]lood will be on their hands."

That's what Sean Penn’s lawyers are saying about Netflix in regards to their release of a documentary series about drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman which, they warn, could put the Academy Award-winning actor in danger.

Theordore J. Boutrous Jr., Penn’s lawyer, wrote a letter to Netflix explaining the release of “The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story” could potentially put Penn in danger because the series implied the actor helped the Department of Justice apprehend the notorious head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, The New York Times reported.

Boutrous told the streaming service in the letter “blood will be on their hands if this film causes bodily harm.”

SEAN PENN TELLS CHARLIE ROSE HE REGRETS EL CHAPO INTERVIEW

The series, which was released Friday, focused on del Castillo, a Mexican actress, and Penn’s October 2015 meeting with Guzman. Penn wrote an article for the Rolling Stone detailing the interview that was facilitated by del Castillo. The essay was published a day after the drug lord was recaptured in Mexico. Penn claimed he had nothing to do with Guzman’s recapture.

Last year, Penn told Charlie Rose that he met the drug lord in a “place nowhere near where he was captured.” He also told Rose the accusations that he helped in Guzman's capture were “incorrect and could put him in danger.”

“It is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish and reckless narrative,” Penn’s spokesman told The New York Times.

COULD SEAN PENN’S ‘EL CHAPO’ INTERVIEW MEAN TROUBLE FOR THE ACTOR?

“The notion that Mr. Penn or anyone on his behalf alerted DOJ (Department of Justice) to the trip is a complete fabrication and boldfaced lie. It never happened, nor would there have been any reason for it to have happened.”

Netflix responded that Penn was “given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate” in the interview but did not. Netflix reiterated the documentary does not reveal any new information but gave del Castillo her chance to tell her side of the story.

Washington is obsessed with the word “collusion” but has little understanding of its true meaning. The confusion might explain why D.C. has missed the big story of collusion between Fusion GPS and the Democratic Party.

To read the headlines, a poor, beleaguered opposition-research firm was humiliated and constitutionally abused this week by partisan Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Fusion’s lawyers sent a 17-page letter to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, accusing him of misdeeds, declaring his subpoenas invalid, and invoking a supposed First Amendment right to silence. Yet the firm’s founders, the story went, were hauled in nonetheless and forced to plead the Fifth. “No American should experience the indignity that occurred today,” Fusion’s lawyer, Joshua Levy, declared.

Fusion is known as a ruthless firm that excels in smear jobs, but few have noticed the operation it’s conducting against the lawmakers investigating it. The false accusations against Mr. Nunes—that he’s acting unethically and extralegally, that he’s sabotaging the Russia probe—are classic.

The Washington narrative is focused on special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Maybe the real story is that Democrats worked with an opposition-research firm that has some alarming ties to Russia and potentially facilitated a disinformation campaign during a presidential election.

This is a firm that in 2012 was paid to dig through the divorce records of a Mitt Romney donor. It’s a firm that human-rights activist Thor Halvorssen testified was hired to spread malicious rumors about him. It’s a firm that financier Bill Browder testified worked to delegitimize his efforts to get justice for Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer beaten to death in a Russian prison.

There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Do the Boy Scouts really need to embrace girls?

Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to "The Andy Griffith Show." To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.

5 phishing scams you need to be aware of

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Phishing uses the name of a trusted entity – often financial institutions – to get sensitive personal information such as passwords and credit card details via bogus email or texts.

“Scam or phishing emails typically have one of two strategies: fear or greed,” Jonathan Penn, Director of Strategy at security software firm Avast, told Fox News. “Fear includes email notifications that your account has been locked, there are charges that you didn’t make, or just that there’s been suspicious activity you need to check. Greed includes notifications about free gifts, trips, or gift cards; stock advice or debt consolidation or financial advice."

Phishing scams are often presented as a call for immediate action. That should always be a tip off.

FAKE NEWS IS HERE TO STAY, STUDY SAYS

“Consumers should remember that urgent requests for personal information or call for immediate action are almost always a scam,” a Bank of America spokesperson told Fox News.

Needless to say, never click on links inside suspicious emails. Here are five of the most common phishing strategies.

Your account has been disabled or suspended

This arrives as an email or text that claims a user's account has been or will be locked, disabled or will expire and asks for login credentials.

A very recent example is an Apple text/email phishing scam that states: “Your Apple ID is due to expire today.” This is one of the more sophisticated scams since it contains no glaring grammatical or spelling errors, a frequent failing of scams.

AppleID's do not “expire” and the malicious URL, in the case, does not point to a real Apple domain.

Irregular or fraudulent activity detected

This scam poses as a "security" update. The scammer will claim fraudulent activity has been detected on your account or your account has been subjected to a “compulsory ‘security update’ and you need to login to enable this security update,” Symantec, a Internet security company, told Fox News.

Tip: If a login link is provided, it's invariably a scam.

Online retailer scams

With the holiday season just around the corner, these scams have the potential to be effective because they can appear as relatively innocuous and appeal to greed rather than fear.

One that has increased over time is fake orders associated with Amazon. “If you received correspondence regarding an order you didn't place, it likely wasn't from Amazon.com,” the tech giant wrote on a customer-help page on its website.

APPLE'S NEXT BIG THING IS HERE: IPHONE X'S 5 BEST FEATURES

Fake pop-ups

While not technically phishing, fake pop-ups are an old trick and still widespread.

The ultimate net effect can be similar to phishing if the scammer gets you, in the end, to provide sensitive information.

"The scammer will typically attempt to get the victim to allow remote access to their computer," said Malwaretips. "After remote access is gained...the scammer relies on confidence tricks...in order to gain the victim’s trust to pay for the supposed 'support' services, when the scammer actually steals the victim’s credit card account information."

Taxes



While not necessarily one of the largest scams, one that is increasing in popularity is tax-themed phishing.

Themes range from updating your filing information to IRS warnings that you owe money. “One thing that’s for sure is that the IRS doesn’t communicate via email or text message, they still send snail mail,” Symantec told Fox News.

Although necessary to ensure the cleanliness of a meal, hot foods continue to steam underneath the lids and cook themselves even further after leaving the kitchen.

But for those dead set on a particular menu item, there are a few hacks to ensure your meal is edible once it arrives.
Avoid soggy fries by requesting they’re cooked extra crispy — or even burnt, Worden says.

Few things are as luxurious as waking up in a hotel room and having a slow breakfast in bed with a plush robe and slippers — except when the lids come off to reveal a plate of congealed eggs, soggy potatoes, and lukewarm coffee.

Preparing food is both an art and a science. And much like how chefs must change their recipes for airplanes, there are certain dishes that should be altered to make the transition from kitchen to room service.

The problem lies in the hospitality lid. Although necessary to ensure the cleanliness of a meal, hot foods continue to steam underneath the lids and cook themselves even further after leaving the kitchen.

“Vented lids cause crispy fried items like fries, onion rings, or even fried shrimp to get soggy from the steam,” Skipp Worden, executive chef at the Westin Jekyll Island in Georgia, told Southern Living.

The lids can also cause cooked vegetables to lose their flavor and texture, pizza to soften its crispy crust, and soup to change textures.

But for those dead set on a particular menu item, there are a few hacks to ensure your meal is edible once it arrives. Avoid soggy fries by requesting they’re cooked extra crispy — or even burnt, Worden says. However when ordering meat, do the exact opposite. Request steak one degree rarer than normal, as it will continue to cook on the delivery trolley.

It's been almost two weeks since the Las Vegas massacre. 59 people were killed, nearly 500 injured and investigators are still baffled by motive... or lack of one...

"We don't know yet what the motive is, but that's not for lack of trying." FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Thursday. "And if you know anything about the Bureau, we don't give up easy."

But there are also questions about the timeline of the massacre. This week Las Vegas law enforcement said it appeared the suspect Stephen Paddock opened fire on a Mandalay Bay security guard six minutes before he opened fire on the concert. The guard Jesus Campos was checking out a door alarm down the hall from Paddock's room when he was hit in the leg by gunfire.

MGM has issued a statement refuting that. That the timeline was constructed earlier, but they now believe shots were being fired at the concert at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the security guard first reported shots were fired. There's still a lot to discover and uncover in the investigation, but what do we know so far, and where investigators are focusing?

Last month, the premiere episode of NBC’s reincarnated “Will & Grace” was essentially a 30-minute anti-Trump infomercial.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
NBC’s “Will & Grace” took another shot at conservatives on Thursday night, using exaggerated stereotypes to portray the right as homophobic with not-so-subtle jabs at Vice President Mike Pence.

Sean Hayes’ character, Jack, explained to Eric McCormack’s Will that he lost touch with his son because, "He moved to Texas, married someone super conservative, and he didn't even invite me to his wedding.”

Upon realizing that he has a grandson in Texas, Will encouraged Jack to bond with him but Sean Hayes’ character didn’t exactly love the idea.

"How am I supposed to connect with a kid from Texas? I can't fish or hunt or tell a woman what to do with her fetus,” he replied.

However, it turns out that Jack might have something in common with his grandson after all, as he is suspected to be gay. He is sent to a mock gay conversion camp called “Straighten Arrow,” where they plan to "pray away the gay," complete with a poster of Vice President Pence.

The Media Research Center’s TV reporter Amelia Hamilton wrote that while conversion therapy is often tied to Pence, "the accusations have just never stuck, except in liberals' minds."

“Anything to keep pushing an oft-debunked myth, I suppose, right?” Hamilton wrote. "Debunked myths, conservative stereotypes, and overwrought situations? It looks like ‘Will & Grace’ knows they're not going to win anybody over by being honest."

Last month, the premiere episode of NBC’s reincarnated “Will & Grace” was essentially a 30-minute anti-Trump infomercial. It referred to First Lady Melania Trump as a “hostage,” portrayed Midwesterners as people who didn’t eat vegetables until Michelle Obama came along and featured Debra Messing’s character, Grace, complaining about the results of last year’s presidential election. People magazine even published a list of all the times the show ripped Trump.

While “Will & Grace” continues to mock conservatives, the creators of the show have actually admitted that they don’t see eye to eye with the man who has turned CNN into a left-leaning network. Creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick told The Hollywood Reporter they only agreed to a reunion because former NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker isn’t involved anymore, as he is now the president of the liberal CNN.

Faith is a guiding force in the lives of Chip and Joanna Gaines, of "Fixer Upper" fame.

"For me, [faith] changed everything," Chip told us. "It's a part of who I am. I can't separate the two."

The contractor said while his relationship with God plays an important role in every aspect of his life, he doesn't want to come off as preachy.

"I try not to rub it in anybody's face," he explained. "I'm not real boisterous about it but people seem to find out about it just through the way that Jo and I live our lives."

He added, "And we're proud of that."

A post shared by Chip Gaines (@chipgaines) on Oct 16, 2017 at 6:06pm PDT

The father of four said the things they learned growing up "have influenced the way we love each other; it influences the way we parent our children; it influences the kind of people we want to be in our community. It's extremely important to me personally."

While Chip said he and Joanna don't want to push their faith onto anyone else, they have been vocal about the way it impacts their lives in the past.

Will Hennessey Performance's new supercar be the first street legal production car to hit the 300 mph barrier?
That’s certainly what the Sealy, Tex., carmaker is suggesting in a series of images announcing the upcoming reveal of its Venom F5.
Hennessey has so far only said that the F5 will approach that speed, but it is looking to outdo the 270 mph Venom GT that preceded it.
That Lotus-based car had a 1,244 twin-turbocharged V8, but also a lot of aerodynamic drag, so the F5 is being designed on its own chassis that’s filled with air channels to make it slipperier at high speeds.
Later versions of the GT got a bump to 1,451 hp, and the F5 will likely have no less than that.

What happened in Vegas seems to be staying in Vegas.

Nearly three weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the release of details surrounding the horrific attack has slowed from a trickle to a standstill: police have yet to schedule another news conference, confusion continues to surround the gunman's motive and critical questions linger about what exactly happened on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

The president of the union representing Jesus Campos – a security officer at the hotel who was shot during the attack and who became the subject of intense public interest after bailing on scheduled TV interviews last week – also told Fox News he has “no idea” whether or not Campos will return to work at Mandalay Bay.

And inside and outside the opulent resort and casino, the crime scene remained frozen in time Friday, as the Las Vegas enterprise was ordered by a judge to not destroy anything that could be considered evidence in a trial -- right down to the broken glass from gunman Stephen Paddock’s suite.

“What our client is saying and what the community and the nation is saying is shifting timelines, witnesses missing...it just creates this general sense of unease, people just don’t feel safe,” attorney Brian Nettles, who is representing shooting victim Rachel Sheppard, told KSNV.

The preservation order from Judge Mark Denton, which was issued Thursday, blocks Mandalay Bay from erasing video surveillance, card swipe data and complaints coming from Paddock’s hotel suite – among other items – until another hearing on Oct. 30 where MGM Resorts International will have a chance to argue against it.

“This was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. We have no intention of renting that room,” the company said in a statement following the order. “We’ve been cooperating with law enforcement from the moment this happened, which includes preserving evidence.”

COUNTRY MUSIC STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CONCERTS

Opposite Mandalay Bay, pictures of the festival grounds taken by KSNV this week show little has changed since the Oct. 1 attack, where 58 people attending a country music concert were gunned down by Paddock from his room. Nearly 500 others were wounded.

“This weekend!” reads a billboard on the festival grounds, surrounded by fences and yellow crime scene tape. Across the street, a black #VegasStrong banner is hanging from the top of the Mandalay Bay resort -- its golden facade glimmering in the sunlight -- with the two boarded up windows Paddock took aim from noticeably standing out.

Campos, who was shot in the leg by Paddock while investigating an alarm on his floor, appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' show this week alongside Stephen Schuck, a hotel maintenance worker who credits Campos for saving his life.

But the host did little to clear up the plethora of unanswered questions about Paddock and response to the shooting, including what caused Paddock to stop firing before authorities ever gained entry to his room, where Paddock was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“If you watch the entire show, the venue is not where I would have put these two heroes to tell their story,” David Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, told Fox News. “I’m not criticizing Mr. Campos and his decision, since he has been through a horrendous event, but what I was saying is it’s not the venue I would have chosen or recommended.”

Hickey said he and Campos met with MGM’s corporate team last week before a series of scheduled television interviews, including one with Fox News' Sean Hannity, which the security officer had agreed to do.

“They said they were concerned about pressure that would be put on Mr. Campos by someone like Sean Hannity,” Hickey told Fox News.

FULL COVERAGE OF LAS VEGAS SHOOTING

He added the casino giant’s executives cited worries about Campos' “health” and expressed concern about the “stress” of appearing on five shows.

“I felt like this was a time that Mr. Campos should be made comfortable and confident to do something he had never done before, to speak on air and to do it live,” Hickey said.

The meeting ended with Campos slipping out while Hickey was in another room and disappearing from the public spotlight for days. Campos resurfaced on television Wednesday for the pre-recorded interview, despite saying last week that he wanted to tell his story and move on, Hickey said.

The union president said the “officers at Mandalay Bay,” such as Campos, are the ones who haven’t been recognized enough in the wake of the attack.

“You can’t work an emergency situation like that and not be under a great deal of stress,” he said.

Instead of helping Lance, the suit claims, jail officials mocked him and did not transport him to a local hospital until four days after he swallowed the pill.

When the hospital indicated Lance needed to be transferred over to a urologist’s office for treatment, he was returned to the jail and was arranged to be released on his own recognizance due to “medical issues,” Tulsa World reported.

The lawsuit names police, government and medical individuals.

Lance is facing a misdemeanor charge of breaking and entering a dwelling without permission in a separate criminal case.

“Alaskan Bush People” star Rain Brown opened up about her struggle with depression on an Instagram post Tuesday.

Brown, 14, posted a picture of a quote reading: “You may not understand today or tomorrow, but eventually God will reveal why you went through everything you did.” The reality star’s caption detailed her struggles to get out of bed in the morning and her loss of motivation.

“For the past few days I’ve been struggling with some things, such as my depression, life, and some teen girl probs too (ya know a broken nail) and I couldn’t figure out why I was in such bad shape. I stayed in bed for about four days with minor aches and pains and I couldn’t find out a reason, it bothered me so much, I lost any want to be healthy or motivational, I was just a husk,” Brown wrote.

LINDSEY STIRLING ON HOW ON HOW SHE EMERGED FROM 'TERRIFYING' COCOON OF DEPRESSION AND ANOREXIA

She continued that although it felt wrong to “stay in bed and watch videos” it was sometimes “okay” to not do anything.

“In the time of all this happening I told myself that over and over but it also hit me I had to actually believe it and just let it go and stop being bothered by it, I still feel kinda down and like being lazy, but that’s alright because my body knows what it needs and if that’s rest I won’t be one to refuse,” Brown said.

She concluded with telling her fans to stay strong and not to let “depression or dark feelings” get you down.

The Brown family, which stars on the hit Discovery Channel reality show, learned in June 2016 that the family’s matriarch, Ami Brown, had stage 4 lung cancer. The family shared Ami’s diagnosis during an episode that aired this June. In the episode, Rain said she was “very scared” for her mother.

“I don’t care who you are. I don’t care what you’ve been through. I don’t care how old you are. If you hear that your mother has cancer, it’s going to shock you,” Rain said. “I just wish I could change it somehow. I’m very scared for her.”

In an interview with People in August, Ami opened up about the pain she was enduring as she underwent radiation and chemotherapy in Southern California. She said her seven children were each handling her sickness “differently.”

"This was a little drastic for strengthening … there are good days and bad days – for them and for me. But they handle their emotions pretty good. There are days that they have to talk about it and then talk about it again," Ami Brown said. "I have faith that they will remain strong."

As Southwest staffers aboard a Boeing 737 prepared for takeoff on Oct. 18, they looked around and noticed something unusual.

From the pilots to the flight attendants that day, the crew on the new Max 8 aircraft was entirely female.

A Southwest spokesperson told HuffPost that, upon realizing they were the first all-female crew to operate one of the company's new Boeing 737 Max 8 airliners, the women snapped a series of photos of the happy, unintentional event, which the company later shared on Twitter. The airline also confirmed that all the women pictured were employees of Southwest, who were operating a flight from St. Louis to San Francisco.

From a group photo of staffers in the aisle to shots of the two pilots in the cockpit (and also hamming it up in front of an engine), the sweet images clearly struck a chord with the Twitterverse, who blew up Southwest’s post with 20,000 likes and 300 comments. Some praised the airline for celebrating its female staffers, while other bemoaned the fact that all-female flight crews were so scarce that their existence had to be lauded.

As Willie Shelton fought terminal cancer, his wife says he consistently had only one greatest wish.

"The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

"We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning," said Cheryl.

"What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it," said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

"We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away," said Flinn.

"He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides," said Cheryl.

"Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday," said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

"He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody," said Flinn.

"This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do," said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

"I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything," said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, "a father's love never ends," engraved on the back.

"Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them," said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

"He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something," said Jennifer.​

Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, "Fixer Upper," hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since "Fixer Upper" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on "Fixer Upper."

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, "Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

"I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days."

Kaling, whose own show "The Mindy Project" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on "Fixer Upper." In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady's office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.
This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June.
But even counting all those employees -- 24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady -- Melania Trump's office is relatively small.
According to those personnel reports, Melania Trump’s staffers include a chief of staff, a communications director, a deputy chief of staff and a deputy director of advance.
During the first few months of the Trump presidency, Melania Trump and son, Barron, remained in New York as he finished the school year.

Melania Trump is embracing a more active and public schedule as first lady – but she still runs one of the leanest East Wing operations in recent history.

According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady's office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.

During then-President Barack Obama’s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year.

This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June. Their salaries totaled $486,700.

Melania Trump staff salaries Lindsay B. Reynolds -- $179,700.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady

-- $179,700.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady Stephanie A. Grisham -- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady

-- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady Timothy G. Tripepi -- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff of operations for the first lady

-- $115,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff of operations for the first lady Mary‐Kathryn Fisher -- $77,000.00 – deputy director of advance for the first lady Source: June 2017 report to Congress on White House personnel

The details are contained in an annual report the White House sends to Congress showing the names, positions and salaries of all its personnel. Both the Obama and Trump administrations acknowledged several additional staffers beyond those listed in the report with the term “first lady” in their titles. But even counting all those employees -- 24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady -- Melania Trump's office is relatively small.

It's an approach her spokeswoman says is intentional.

“As with all things that she does, she is being very deliberate in her hiring, focusing on quality over quantity,” communications director Stephanie Grisham said in an email. “It is important to her that the team is a good fit for what she wants to accomplish as first lady, and that everyone works well together. She also wants to be mindful and responsible when it comes to taxpayer money.”

MELANIA TRUMP SLAMS IVANA FOR CALLING HERSELF FIRST LADY

While the 2009 annual report listed 16 staffers for Michelle Obama, her press secretary said at the time the staff actually included 24 people. A 2009 FactCheck.org story said Obama’s 24 aides might have broken records.

“That may indeed be the largest of any first lady, but Hillary Clinton, with 19 staffers, and Laura Bush with at least 18 and perhaps more, weren’t far behind,” FactCheck.org said.

Michelle Obama staff salaries Susan S. Sher -- $172,200.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady

-- $172,200.00 -- assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady Jocelyn C. Frye -- $140,000.00 -- deputy assistant to the president and director of policy and projects for the first lady

-- $140,000.00 -- deputy assistant to the president and director of policy and projects for the first lady Camille Y. Johnston -- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady

-- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and director of communications for the first lady Melissa E. Winter -- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff to the first lady

-- $102,000.00 – special assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff to the first lady David S. Medina -- $90,000.00 – deputy chief of staff to the first lady

-- $90,000.00 – deputy chief of staff to the first lady Catherine M. Lelyveld -- $84,000.00 director and press secretary to the first lady

-- $84,000.00 director and press secretary to the first lady Frances M. Starkey -- $75,000.00 – director of scheduling and advance for the first lady

-- $75,000.00 – director of scheduling and advance for the first lady Trooper Sanders -- $70,000.00 -- deputy director of policy and projects for the first lady

-- $52,500.00 – associate director and deputy press secretary to the first lady Kristen E. Jarvis -- $50,000.00 – special assistant for scheduling and traveling aide to the first lady

-- $50,000.00 – special assistant for scheduling and traveling aide to the first lady Tyler A. Lechtenberg -- $45,000.00 – associate director of correspondence for the first lady

-- $45,000.00 – associate director of correspondence for the first lady Joseph J. Boswell -- $40,000.00 – executive assistant to the chief of staff to the first lady

-- $40,000.00 – executive assistant to the chief of staff to the first lady Deilia A. Jackson -- $36,000.00 – deputy associate director of correspondence for the first lady Source: July 2009 report to Congress on White House personnel

Grisham told Fox News this week there are nine people working in the East Wing under Melania Trump, a few more than listed in the annual report.

According to those personnel reports, Melania Trump’s staffers include a chief of staff, a communications director, a deputy chief of staff and a deputy director of advance.

Michelle Obama’s staff included those same positions and a slew of others: additional press aides, a director of policy and projects, a personal aide, a traveling aide and a director of correspondence.

Michelle Obama’s office did not return a request for comment.

But the larger staff is likely due in part to Michelle Obama entering the East Wing with a more aggressive agenda and embracing initiatives like her Let's Move! child obesity campaign.

During the first few months of the Trump presidency, Melania Trump and son, Barron, remained in New York as he finished the school year.

But she has noticeably ramped up public activity in recent weeks, including hosting a roundtable discussion on the opioid crisis and traveling with her husband to tour the destruction of hurricanes and meet with the victims of the Las Vegas massacre.

“She is more like a Pat Nixon or a Bess Truman than a Hillary Clinton or a Michelle Obama,” Andrew Och, a first lady historian who was a producer for the C-SPAN's “First Ladies: Influence and Image” series, said of Melania Trump.

Och noted that there is no formal job description for a first lady and each one defines their role. Melania Trump, he said, does not come from the world of politics and “clearly does not feel the need for the larger staffs that her predecessors have had.”

The first lady’s office isn’t the only place in the White House where the Trump administration has trimmed staff positions. When the White House personnel report was released in June, Forbes reported 110 fewer employees under Donald Trump than Barack Obama and said the projected four-year savings resulting from the cuts could be more than $22 million.

Will Hennessey Performance's new supercar be the first street legal production car to hit the 300 mph barrier?
That’s certainly what the Sealy, Tex., carmaker is suggesting in a series of images announcing the upcoming reveal of its Venom F5.
Hennessey has so far only said that the F5 will approach that speed, but it is looking to outdo the 270 mph Venom GT that preceded it.
That Lotus-based car had a 1,244 twin-turbocharged V8, but also a lot of aerodynamic drag, so the F5 is being designed on its own chassis that’s filled with air channels to make it slipperier at high speeds.
Later versions of the GT got a bump to 1,451 hp, and the F5 will likely have no less than that.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​

Toyota hints at luxury car of the future with fuel cell concept

Toyota’s first volume fuel cell vehicle, the Mirai, is an econo sedan priced like a luxury one.
The Fine-Comfort Ride concept, unveiled on Wednesday ahead of a debut next week at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show, is a high-performance luxury car powered by a fuel cell.
There is seating for six, despite the Fine-Comfort Ride stretching just 190 inches in length, or a smidge less than the Mirai.
While the Fine-Comfort Ride may or may not be headed for production in the near future, another fuel cell concept from Toyota will be spawning a production model very soon.
It uses two fuel cell stacks with generate enough electricity to power a pair of electric motors each delivering 150 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Toyota’s first volume fuel cell vehicle, the Mirai, is an econo sedan priced like a luxury one. Understandably, the car hasn’t proven a hit, with Toyota moving just 708 examples in the first half of 2017 in the United States. (Of course, it also doesn’t help that hydrogen fueling stations are non-existent in most parts.)

Perhaps, though, Toyota could have had more success if it followed Tesla’s strategy of introducing new technology in high-end products brimming with coolness. Well, that could still happen if Toyota’s latest concept is any indication of the automaker’s future path for fuel cells.

The Fine-Comfort Ride concept, unveiled on Wednesday ahead of a debut next week at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show, is a high-performance luxury car powered by a fuel cell.

A fuel cell stack at the front of the vehicle turns hydrogen from storage tanks under the floor into electricity which then powers an electric drive system delivering up to 415 horsepower. With this much juice on tap, Toyota says the Fine-Comfort Ride will accelerate to 62 mph from rest in 5.4 seconds and top out at 136 mph. Meanwhile, the range on a fill of hydrogen is claimed to be 620 miles.

The exterior is more minivan than luxury sedan but the interior keeps things cool with its funky, futuristic design. There is seating for six, despite the Fine-Comfort Ride stretching just 190 inches in length, or a smidge less than the Mirai.

The ample space is made possible by adopting in-wheel motors for the propulsion, positioning the wheels at the very corners of the vehicle, and utilizing a reinforced underbody for the ride stability and quietness expected in a premium car.

There’s fully self-driving technology available, too. So when the driver tires of doing the actual driving, he or she can flip the car into autonomous mode and then turn the seat around to join in on the conversation with other passengers. An artificial intelligence system, which Toyota calls the AI Agent and will be present in three separate concepts, watches over the driver as needed and assists as needed.

While the Fine-Comfort Ride may or may not be headed for production in the near future, another fuel cell concept from Toyota will be spawning a production model very soon. The concept is the Sora bus which will be put into production next year. It uses two fuel cell stacks with generate enough electricity to power a pair of electric motors each delivering 150 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. Toyota doesn’t state a range but says the bus can hold 158 gallons of hydrogen.

The Tokyo Motor Show starts October 25. For more coverage on the event, head to our dedicated hub.

A driver who was distracted by a taco while driving a tractor-trailer Wednesday crashed on a Washington state highway, spilling a load of woodchips across the two-lane road.

The unnamed driver was eating a taco while driving when he lost control of his truck, according to the Yakima Herald.

Washington State Trooper Brian Moore said the driver drifted onto a shoulder of the Blewett Pass in the Wenatchee Mountains, and over-corrected to the point that the truck rolled, resulting in woodchips spread across the highway, which was temporarily closed.

The tractor-trailer’s overturn wasn’t the first on the Washington highway this week.

A semi-truck on Monday also rolled over at the Blewett Pass, leaving 56,000 pounds of Red Delicious apples strewn across the immediate area, KOMO News reported.

A new Washington state distracted driving law — mainly focused on handheld electronics — that was implemented by Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., in July was meant to crack down on sidetracked drivers.

Under the new law, “eating” is considered a secondary offense, and warrants a ticket if a police officer pulls someone over for it.
