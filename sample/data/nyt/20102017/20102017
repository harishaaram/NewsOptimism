Lack of sleep may raise the risk for gestational diabetes.

Gestational diabetes — abnormally high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy — can lead to excessive birth weight, preterm birth or respiratory distress in the baby, among other problems. It can also increase the mother’s risk for Type 2 diabetes later in life.

Researchers pooled data from eight studies involving 17,595 women. Seven of the studies depended on self-reports of sleep, and one measured sleep duration. After adjusting for variables such as age, body mass index and ethnicity, they found that women who slept less than 6.25 hours a night were almost three times as likely to have gestational diabetes as those who slept more. The study is in Sleep Medicine Reviews.

The reasons for the link are not known, but the authors suggest that hormonal changes in pregnancy as well as systematic inflammation tied to lack of sleep can lead to insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels. But the study is observational and does not prove a causal relationship between poor sleep and gestational diabetes.

“Minimizing sleep disruption is important — limiting caffeine, avoiding electronics at bedtime and so on,” said the lead author, Dr. Sirimon Reutrakul, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “It’s another factor that may influence overall health. But it’s easier said than done.”

When “Born to Run” transformed Bruce Springsteen into a star in 1975, he celebrated by following the title track’s advice: He got his own “chrome wheeled, fuel-injected” dream car.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

BARCELONA, Spain — These days, the city of Barcelona wears two hats. And not too comfortably.

On the one hand, Barcelona is a global city, a former host of the Olympics, and the home of one of the world’s most famous soccer clubs, F.C. Barcelona. It is a magnet for more than 10 million visitors a year, an example of the ways large cities increasingly influence global politics, economics and culture.

On the other hand, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, Spain’s restive northeastern region, and the nerve center of a drive for Catalan independence that is described by its opponents as parochial, exclusive and nationalist.

In that campaign — which the Spanish government now says it will take emergency measures to halt — there is no place in Catalonia with more at stake. In Barcelona, the issue of independence has provoked exceptionally sharp soul-searching and debate over allegiances and identity, with an intensity not seen since Britain voted to leave the European Union.

In short, people are worried. First among them is the city’s leftist mayor, Ada Colau, who is not in favor of leaving. “It’s a very pluralistic city and there is a lot of diversity of opinions in Barcelona,” she said in an interview this week.

At first, it was quirky in the Seattle way: Jeff Bezos, an oversize mailbox and his little online start-up. His thing was books, remember? How quaint. How retro. Almost any book, delivered to your doorstep, cheap. But soon, publishers came to see Amazon as the evil empire, bringing chaos to an industry that hadn’t changed much since Herman Melville’s day.

The prosperity bomb, as it’s called around here, came when Amazon took over what had been a clutter of parking lots and car dealers near downtown, and decided to build a very urban campus. This neighborhood had been proposed as a grand central city park, our own Champs-Élysées, with land gifted by Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder. But voters rejected it. I still remember an architect friend telling me that cities should grow “organically,” not by design.

Cities used to be tied to geography: a river, a port, the lee side of a mountain range. Boeing grew up here, in part, because of its proximity to spruce timber used to make early airplanes. And then, water turned the industrial engines that helped to win World War II.

The new era dawned with Microsoft, after the local boy Bill Gates returned with a fledgling company. From then on, the mark of a successful city was one that could cluster well-educated people in a cool place. “The Smartest Americans Are Heading West” was the headline in the recent listing of the Bloomberg Brain Concentration Index. This pattern is likely to continue, as my colleagues at the Upshot calculated in picking Denver to win the Amazon sweepstakes.

At the bottom of the brain index was Muskegon, Mich., a place I recently visited. I found the city lovely, with its lakeside setting, fine old houses and world-class museum. When I told a handful of Muskegonites about the problems in Seattle from the metastatic growth of Amazon, they were not sympathetic.

What comes with the title of being the fastest growing big city in the country, with having the nation’s hottest real estate market, is that the city no longer works for some people. For many others, the pace of change, not to mention the traffic, has been disorienting. The character of Seattle, a rain-loving communal shrug, has changed. Now we’re a city on amphetamines.

Amazon is secretive. And they haven’t been the best civic neighbor, late to the charity table. Yes, the company has poured $38 billion into the city’s economy. They have 40,000 employees here, who in turn attracted 50,000 other new jobs. They own or lease a fifth of all the class A office space.

But median home prices have doubled in five years, to $700,000. This is not a good thing in a place where teachers and cops used to be able to afford a house with a water view.

Our shiny new megalopolis has spawned the inevitable political backlash. If you think there’s nothing more annoying than a Marxist with a bullhorn extolling a failed 19th-century economic theory, put that person on your City Council. So Seattle’s council now includes a socialist, Kshama Sawant, who wants “the public” to take over Amazon ownership. Other council members have proposed a tax on jobs. Try that proposal in Detroit.

As a Seattle native, I miss the old city, the lack of pretense, and dinner parties that didn’t turn into discussions of real estate porn. But I’m happy that wages have risen faster here than anywhere else in the country. I like the fresh energy. To the next Amazon lottery winner I would say, enjoy the boom — but be careful what you wish for.

Back Story

“When something outrages you,” Stéphane Hessel wrote, “as Nazism did me, that is when you become a militant, strong and engaged.”

Born on this day in 1917, Mr. Hessel, a French Resistance hero and Holocaust survivor, became an unlikely publishing phenomenon in 2011 at the age of 93, topping best-seller lists with “Indignez-Vous!”

Photo

At about 4,000 words, “Indignez-Vous!” (“Time for Outrage!”) was more pamphlet than book. But it resonated with French readers gearing up for a presidential election, and with those elsewhere who were protesting the eurozone crisis, participating in the Arab Spring uprisings or occupying Wall Street.

Mr. Hessel urged young people to revive the spirit of the resistance by peacefully protesting the financial markets, France’s treatment of illegal immigrants, the influence of the rich on the news media and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

“Indignez-Vous!” sold more than three million copies in Europe in less than a year and was translated into more than a dozen languages. (The Nation magazine published the full text in English.)

Mr. Hessel died in 2013, but his call to outrage endures: “You join the movement of history,” he wrote, “and the great current of history continues to flow only thanks to each and every one of us.”

Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology.
Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.
But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply.
Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he recalled, saying he wrote them off as mild misbehavior. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

In the hourlong conversation, Mr. Tarantino, 54, apologized for not doing more while also explaining why; admitted his own culpability while also calling for sweeping change in Hollywood’s treatment of women; and condemned Mr. Weinstein, 65, while acknowledging their father-son closeness.

The producer and director have been symbiotic for decades: from 1992, when Mr. Weinstein distributed “Reservoir Dogs,” through “Pulp Fiction,” the “Kill Bill” films, “Inglourious Basterds” and “The Hateful Eight,” until a few weeks ago, when he threw Mr. Tarantino an engagement party.

When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said. But some of the accounts were deeply familiar to him. “Everyone who was close to Harvey had heard of at least one of those incidents” chronicled in the first few articles, he said. “It was impossible they didn’t.”

The Weinstein Investigation

When he and Ms. Sorvino started dating in 1995, she told him that not long before, Mr. Weinstein had massaged her without asking, chased her around a hotel room and even showed up at her apartment in the middle of the night, a story she recently shared with The New Yorker.

“I was shocked and appalled” back then, Mr. Tarantino said. “I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira.” She had won accolades for her performance in “Mighty Aphrodite,” and “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way,” Mr. Tarantino said. “Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The problem was resolved, he said he felt at the time, because he and Ms. Sorvino were dating. “I’m with her, he knows that, he won’t mess with her, he knows that she’s my girlfriend,” Mr. Tarantino said, describing his attitude back then.

Over the years, he learned of other accounts. Another actress friend told him a troubling story of unwanted advances by Mr. Weinstein in a hotel room. Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology. (She confirmed the account to The Times but declined to be identified.)

Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. Recently, she tweeted that Mr. Weinstein had raped her.

Mr. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex made by Ms. McGowan and others.

There were rumors too, shadowy accounts that Mr. Tarantino continued to hear second- or thirdhand and never pursued further. Now Mr. Tarantino said he regretted not taking the women’s stories seriously enough. “I chalked it up to a ’50s-’60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s O.K. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

In the interview, Mr. Tarantino issued several calls to action. In its treatment of women, Hollywood has been “operating under an almost Jim Crow-like system that us males have almost tolerated,” he said. “We allowed it to exist because that’s the way it was.”

On the discussion of who knew what about Mr. Weinstein and when, he said: “I’m calling on the other guys who knew more to not be scared. Don’t just give out statements. Acknowledge that there was something rotten in Denmark. Vow to do better by our sisters.”

He added, “What was previously accepted is now untenable to anyone of a certain consciousness.”

His own relationship with Mr. Weinstein, who has been fired from his own company and ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, spanned deals and shoots, publicity tours and film festivals. But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply. Mr. Weinstein needs to “face the music,” he said.

Despite their closeness, he said he could offer no insight into Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misdeeds. “I don’t have an answer for why he could do this and be stripped of his entire legacy,” he said.

Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused. “I don’t know,” he said. “I hope it doesn’t.”

In Napa, vineyard workers were bringing in the last of the grape harvest, and wineries, tasting rooms, hotels and restaurants were starting to reopen for business. The local tourism group, Visit Napa Valley, has posted a Napa Valley Operations page on its website, with current closures. Another two dozen businesses have reported that they will back up and running by next week.

Of the tasting rooms that were open, some, like Cakebread Cellars, were donating fees to benefit fire relief. Other wineries, like HALL Wines, were matching donations to local community funds.

Cate Conniff, communications manager at Napa Valley Vintners, a trade association, said that of the 330 member wineries that responded to outreach — including wineries in severely affected areas like Atlas Peak, Calistoga and Mt. Veeder — fewer than 50 reported direct property damage. About 90 percent of the grapes by volume had been picked before the fires began. Wine inventories from previous vintages, she added, were in pretty good shape. “We’re beginning to move toward the next phase, of recovery,” she said. “Our livelihood depends on it.”

The fires burned more than just vineyards. The upper part of Napa’s 850-acre Skyline Wilderness Park was charred, and small fires were still active on Tuesday. The steep slopes of Robert Louis Stevenson State Park, in Napa, Sonoma and Lake counties, meant that firefighters had trouble creating a fire break; a large swath of the park burned. In Sonoma, Jack London State Historic Park, Sugarloaf Ridge State Park and Trione-Annadel State Park are all closed until further notice.

In Santa Rosa, the worst of the fires ravaged several neighborhoods and threatened the Safari West Wildlife Preserve and its 1,000 animals, which include rhinoceroses, hyenas and cheetahs. Peter Lang, the preserve’s owner, spent the first night of the wildfires putting out spot fires and spraying down the preserve perimeter to save his animals, even as his own home burned. The staff is currently making repairs to the property, and tentatively expects tours and activities to resume in November, and the lodge to reopen for overnight guests in March.

Like others who are heavily dependent on tourism, Catherine Bartolomei, who owns and runs the Farmhouse Inn in Forestville, 10 miles west of Santa Rosa, is anxious about the loss of visitors.

“Last week half my staff was evacuated, two of them lost their homes, and my parents stayed in a shelter,” Ms. Bartolomei said. “My kids were making food for firefighters. And then, when the fire danger passed here, we did two weddings on Saturday, when it was a beautiful day” — all while fires were licking the edge of the town of Sonoma.

“It’s so odd. Kind of like Nero fiddling while Rome burned,” she said. “But we need people to come back. Come and eat and drink with us. We need you.”

In Sonoma’s historic downtown plaza, restaurants and bars were reopening, though with limited menus and unreliable phone service. Last week, when the plaza was all but deserted, someone had placed a white particulate mask on a recently installed bronze statue of General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, a 19th-century military commander, sitting on a park bench. Taped on the seat next to him was a printed sign: “The Love in the Air Is Thicker Than the Smoke.” It ended with a hashtag: #SONOMAPROUD.

Half a block away, the Sonoma Valley Museum of Art was still closed, with new exhibits put on hold. “When SVMA does reopen, exhibition admission will be free to the public for the rest of the year,” wrote Linda Keaton, the museum’s executive director, in a Facebook post.

Other venues will reopen in the coming weeks and months. In Napa, Meadowood, the celebrated inn and restaurant, partially reopened on Thursday (the restaurant didn’t have enough diners to open, but they expect it to this weekend), and Auberge du Soleil, the Michelin-starred restaurant and hotel, was slated to do so on Friday.

At the Girl & the Fig, a 20-year-old restaurant on the plaza, customers on Tuesday evening were mostly locals, happy for a little normalcy. “I am more proud today to live in Sonoma with this community than I have ever been,” said Sondra Bernstein, the restaurant’s owner. She spent the previous week getting hundreds of meals out to firefighters, police, emergency medical workers and evacuation shelters, in partnership with the local Rotary Club.. Three of her staff lost their homes.

“We’ve had so many cancellations, we don’t know the impact yet,” she said. “But everybody is in this to get back as quick as we can, and to support each other’s businesses right now. The winemakers I’m talking to are still really hopeful for a good season.”

At the opposite corner of the plaza, Saul Gropman of the intimate, 36-seat Cafe La Haye was writing a menu for the evening’s reopening. “There are so many people who want to do something,” he said. “The most important thing we can do is to tell people we’re open, we’re here. And we want them to come.”

Vikings Razed the Forests. Can Iceland Regrow Them?

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
But restoring even a portion of Iceland’s once-vast forests is a slow and seemingly endless task.
“We have gained maybe half a percent in the last century.”Even in a small country like Iceland, a few million trees a year is just a drop in the bucket.
“An important contributor to Iceland’s mitigation policy is planting trees,” said Gudmundur Halldorsson, research coordinator of the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland.
They are now grown as saplings at greenhouses in Iceland, because importing live trees is prohibited.
No one expects that one-quarter of Iceland will ever be covered in forests again.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
GUNNARSHOLT, Iceland — With his flats of saplings and a red planting tool, Jon Asgeir Jonsson is a foot soldier in the fight to reforest Iceland, working to bring new life to largely barren landscapes.

The country lost most of its trees more than a thousand years ago, when Viking settlers took their axes to the forests that covered one-quarter of the countryside. Now Icelanders would like to get some of those forests back, to improve and stabilize the country’s harsh soils, help agriculture and fight climate change.

But restoring even a portion of Iceland’s once-vast forests is a slow and seemingly endless task. Despite the planting of three million or more trees in recent years, the amount of land that is covered in forest — estimated at about 1 percent at the turn of the 20th century, when reforestation was made a priority — has barely increased.

“It’s definitely a struggle,” said Mr. Jonsson, a forester who works for the private Icelandic Forestry Association and plants saplings with volunteers from the many local forestry groups in this island nation of 350,000 people. “We have gained maybe half a percent in the last century.”

Even in a small country like Iceland, a few million trees a year is just a drop in the bucket.

Iceland’s austere, largely treeless landscapes, punctuated by vast glaciers and stark volcanoes, have long been a favorite of the film industry.

The picturesque vistas also have helped fuel a tourism boom. Nearly 1.8 million foreigners visited the country last year.

But with that beauty comes a problem that Icelanders have faced for centuries. The lack of trees, coupled with the ash and larger pieces of volcanic rock spewed by eruptions, has led to severe soil erosion.

With vegetation unable to gain much of a foothold, farming and grazing have been next to impossible in many parts of the country. And the loose soil, combined with Iceland’s strong winds, has led to sandstorms that can further damage the land — and even blast the paint off cars.

Iceland’s farmers struggled with erosion and windblown soil for centuries. But in the decades that followed a particularly destructive sandstorm east of the capital, Reykjavik, in 1882, the government established reforestation and soil conservation efforts.

Reforesting more of the Icelandic countryside would have benefits beyond helping farmers and stopping sandstorms. As climate change has become a greater concern, Iceland’s leaders have viewed reforestation as a way to help the country meet its climate goals.

Despite the widespread use of geothermal energy and hydropower, Iceland has high per-capita emissions of greenhouse gases, largely because of transportation and heavy industries like aluminum smelting. The government is working with the European Union and Norway to meet an overall goal of a 40 percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels by 2030. Separately, Iceland has its own target of a reduction between 50 percent and 75 percent by 2050.

Trees, by incorporating atmospheric carbon dioxide into their trunks, roots and other tissues, can offset some of the country’s emissions.

“An important contributor to Iceland’s mitigation policy is planting trees,” said Gudmundur Halldorsson, research coordinator of the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland. “It is a big discussion here.”

But as Mr. Jonsson’s work shows, once the trees are gone, it’s no easy task to bring them back.

When Iceland was first settled at the end of the ninth century, much of the land on or near the coast was covered in birch woodlands.

“The people that came here were Iron Age culture,” Dr. Halldorsson said. “And they did what Iron Age culture did.”

The settlers slashed and burned the forests to grow hay and barley, and to create grazing land. They used the timber for building and for charcoal for their forges. By most accounts, the island was largely deforested within three centuries.

“They removed the pillar out of the ecosystem,” Dr. Halldorsson said.

Eruptions over the ensuing centuries from some of Iceland’s many volcanoes deposited thick layers of volcanic material. The ash, while rich in nutrients, made for very fragile, poor soil that couldn’t hold water and moved around as the wind blew.

As a result, Iceland is a case study in desertification, with little or no vegetation, though the problem is not heat or drought. About 40 percent of the country is desert, Dr. Halldorsson said. “But there’s plenty of rainfall — we call it ‘wet desert.’” The situation is so bad that students from countries that are undergoing desertification come here to study the process.

Dr. Halldorsson’s office is at Gunnarsholt, site of one of Iceland’s oldest farmsteads, 60 miles east of Reykjavik and not far from one of the country’s largest volcanoes, Hekla.

In the huge sandstorm of 1882, the farm and much of the surrounding area was buried. Over nearly two weeks, the blowing sand scoured the land and destroyed all the vegetation. Hundreds of sheep died, their wool so weighed down with sand that they could not reach shelter. A nearby lake was completely filled in; farmers found trout lying on the top of the sand once the storm was over.

“Simply everything was stripped away,” Dr. Halldorsson said. “This is what people don’t realize. You can lose something like this in relatively few years.”

The soil conservation service took over the farm in the 1920s and has used it as an outdoor laboratory to study ways to improve the soil and enable vegetation to grow. The process usually begins with lyme grass, which grows quickly and can stabilize the soil. Lupine, with its spiky purple flowers, is often next. The trees come later.

The work of planting saplings usually begins with an evaluation of the particular site. For Mr. Jonsson of the forestry association, that means looking at what vegetation is already growing there. “You can estimate the richness of the soil underneath,” he said.

Mr. Jonsson and his volunteers then plant the appropriate species for the plot — birch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, Russian larch or other species. “We’d love to plant aspen,” he said. “But sheep really love aspen.”

For Saemundur Thorvaldsson, a government forester who works with volunteer groups and farmers in the Westfjords region of northern Iceland, the “right” tree about 30 percent of the time is birch, the same species that was dominant when Iceland was settled. Birch can tolerate poor soils, and although it grows very slowly it eventually provides shelter for other species.

Most of those other species — Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, black cottonwood — originated in Alaska. They are now grown as saplings at greenhouses in Iceland, because importing live trees is prohibited.

They grow faster than birch, so as a way to store carbon they are more effective. But everything in Iceland grows slowly, Mr. Thorvaldsson said. At one forest outside Isafjordur, planted in the 1940s, spruces were perhaps 50 feet tall. In southeast Alaska they could easily reach three times that height, he said.

No one expects that one-quarter of Iceland will ever be covered in forests again. But given slow growth rates and the enormity of the task, even more modest gains will take a long time, Mr. Thorvaldsson said.

“The aim now is that in the next 50 years we might go up to 5 percent,” he said. “But at the speed we’re at now, it would take 150 years to do that.”

When “Born to Run” transformed Bruce Springsteen into a star in 1975, he celebrated by following the title track’s advice: He got his own “chrome wheeled, fuel-injected” dream car.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

Since 1997, Dr. Kennedy has flown planes and helicopters over Saudi Arabia’s neighbor Jordan, photographing the angular and wheel-like structures scattered over its lava field or harrat. Not much is known about the people who built the edifices, but they are thought to have constructed them at least 2,000 years ago and maybe as far back as 9,000 years ago, according to Dr. Kennedy. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day Bedouin people in the region.

The most well-known of the basalt boulder structures are the “kites,” which were first identified by air pilots in the 1920s. Each looks like a child’s kite, complete with strings and long fluttering tails that are two-dimensionally flattened into the ground.

Archaeologists think ancient nomadic tribes used the kites, which can be more than a mile long, for hunting. The structure’s two long converging walls would funnel stampedes of gazelles into the body of the kite, where they would be slaughtered.

But the lava fields extend beyond Jordan’s borders into countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia. So do their mysteries. Saudi Arabia in particular offers a wealth of harrats that are just out of Dr. Kennedy’s reach.

“We would have loved to fly across into Saudi Arabia to take images. But you never get the permission,” he said. “And then along comes Google Earth.”

In 2004, Dr. Abdullah Al-Saeed, a neurologist and founder of the Desert Team, a group of amateur archaeologists in Saudi Arabia, explored the bleak lava field known as Harrat Khaybar. He saw walls of stones stacked about three feet high, but said that he did not appreciate their unique design at that time.

Then in 2008 he returned to the same spot from his desktop computer.

“When I saw the updated images of Harrat Khaybar from Google Earth, I was literally stunned and could not sleep that night,” Dr. Al-Saeed said in an email. “Flying like a bird all over the Harrat from one enigmatic structure to another! How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?”

He spoke to his colleagues, and they set out to investigate the most striking structure they saw in person. The Harrat Khaybar was more than 550 miles from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. So they took a plane to a nearby city, rented a car and set out for the volcanic domes. In order to navigate the rocky terrain, they had to do much of their exploration on foot through the lava field.

“The question we always discuss while investigating them is, why here? Why in this stony, frightful, rugged land?” he said. He snapped several photos and sent them along with the Google images to archaeologists like Dr. Kennedy for feedback.

“Absolute bafflement.” That’s what Dr. Kennedy said he felt when he first saw the satellite images. Suddenly, he was confronted with structures quite different from anything he had ever seen before. He called them gates because when looked at horizontally, they resemble a simple fence with two thick upright posts on the sides connected by one or more long bars.

“They don’t look like funerary, for disposing of dead bodies. They don’t look like structures where people lived, and they don’t look like animal traps,” he said. “I don’t know what they are.”

More Reporting on Archaeology

For nearly a decade, he has painstakingly cataloged nearly 400 gates. In 2011, his work was featured by Google in a video (for which he was paid). The longest gate he had identified was more than 1,600 feet long, though most were between 160 and 500 feet long. Sometimes the posts were as thick as 30 feet. One gate is intertwined with a kite.

Next he hopes to get accurate dating of the gates, which he suspects may in some cases be older than the kites, and perhaps the oldest man-made structures in the landscape. He invites armchair archaeologists to search the harrats online and share any finds with him.

“More will be found as more people get involved in scouring the landscape from satellite imagery,” he said.

Stephan Kempe, a retired professor of physical geology at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany, who was not involved in the paper, called the gate structures interesting and said that the new study was one of a series of papers describing previously unnoticed structures in the Saudi Arabian lava fields.

“There are many other features that have only recently been understood as forming classes of prehistoric ‘geoglyphs’ that were widespread in an area thought to be very barren and devoid of human impact,” he said in an email.

He added that he would have liked to have seen some suggestions from Dr. Kennedy as to what the gates may have been used for, if only to dissuade people from speculating as to extraterrestrial origins, as they have regarding the Sphinx and the Nazca Lines in Peru.

Still, the new findings tell of a time when the climate and ecology of Saudi Arabia was most likely much different from today, he said. Given the differences, “the mind of people in the past is not that easily read.”

“Why not?” I remember him asking. “Because I don’t like vodka, and I don’t like diet soda, and I don’t like them together,” I said. “You are going to drink that,” he insisted. I smiled again and said that I wouldn’t. He gave up and called me stubborn. I said, “I know.” And the meal proceeded without much further ado. In this second encounter with Harvey, I found him to be pushy and idiosyncratic more than anything.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.

我们先要说明一点，你应该清理这些地方并不是因为它们会让你身体不适之类的，而是因为它们可能很脏，容易藏污纳垢。它们也许还会聚积细菌，不过我们没必要害怕得不行。

自身免疫失调或容易生病的人，或许应该比其他人更留心，但你的清洁工作便是让它们在很长一段时间里保持良好工作状态的好办法。

门把手

你可能没想过要非常频繁地清洁家中各处的门把手，但下次打扫同一个房间时，有必要顺便擦拭一下它们。鉴于我们会非常频繁地触碰家中的门把手，尤其是在手很脏或进出洗手间的时候，也许你还应该把这种做法变成一种习惯。

Kelly Delivers Fervent Defense of Trump Call to Soldier’s Widow

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
“Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud,” Mr. Kelly told an unusually hushed room filled with reporters.
“The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.
The movie, which recounted the return of the Marine’s remains, “is worth seeing,” Mr. Kelly said.
“When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country,” Mr. Kelly said.
“We don’t look down upon those of you who haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said before concluding his remarks.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Late Thursday night, Mr. Trump assailed Ms. Wilson in a tweet, accusing her of listening “SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!”

Mr. Kelly struck a tone that was more even, if just as powerful. He displayed scorn for a society that he said does not appreciate the sacrifice of those in the military. “Most of you as Americans don’t know them,” he said, bemoaning that “there’s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate but required.”

A retired Marine general whose son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was slain in battle in 2010, Mr. Kelly has long guarded his personal story of loss even as he served as a high-profile public official. He broke that silence in dramatic fashion on Thursday, offering — from his personal and professional experience — a detailed, even excruciating description of what happens to the remains of those killed in combat, and how the grieving families back home are notified.

“Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud,” Mr. Kelly told an unusually hushed room filled with reporters. “They’re packed in ice, typically at the air head, and then they’re flown to — usually Europe, where they’re then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the medals that they’ve earned, the emblems of their service.”

He testified to the deep pain that parents feel when they get an early-morning knock on the door from an official to tell them that their son or daughter has been killed in action. “The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

And he described the moment that he got the knock on his own door: A military official telling him that his son “was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed,” Mr. Kelly recalled. “He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we were at war.”

Mr. Kelly also revealed, apparently for the first time, that he was standing next to Pfc. Chance Phelps, the subject of the HBO movie “Taking Chance,” as the Marine private was killed by hostile fire in Anbar Province in Iraq. The movie, which recounted the return of the Marine’s remains, “is worth seeing,” Mr. Kelly said.

Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Kelly’s blunt remarks will have impact because of the stark contrast with an administration that has repeatedly lost credibility with the public.

“Its great power was you knew he was telling the truth, and in all specifics,” said Ms. Noonan, a Wall Street Journal columnist. “Kelly comes to the podium and it was credible, and you felt a kind of relief, and respect and gratitude.”

The surprise appearance by Mr. Kelly came after Mr. Trump and the White House were defensively consumed by the president’s actions this week — first, appearing to criticize former presidents for failing to call the families of fallen service members, and later for the words Mr. Trump chose to use in speaking with Sergeant Johnson’s widow.

Their conversation was first revealed by Ms. Wilson, who quoted Mr. Trump as saying that Sergeant Johnson “knew what he signed up for.” The congresswoman told reporters that she and the Johnson family were offended by the president’s bluntness.

Mr. Kelly’s initial grief on Thursday quickly gave way to an anger that was fueled by what he said was an unfair attack on his boss.

He said Mr. Trump was merely trying to express what Mr. Kelly had discussed with the president before the phone call — that soldiers like Sergeant Johnson were doing what they loved, and what they had chosen to do, when they were killed serving the country.

“That’s what the president tried to say to four families,” Mr. Kelly said. He later appeared to attack Ms. Wilson by noting that, during an emotional 2015 ceremony, a congresswoman had crassly claimed political credit for getting funding for an F.B.I. building in Miami that was named for fallen agents. Ms. Wilson’s congressional district includes parts of Miami.

“And we were stunned — stunned that she’d done it,” Mr. Kelly recalled, though he did not name Ms. Wilson. “Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.”

Ms. Wilson’s office declined to respond. The congresswoman also had pushed legislation to quickly name the F.B.I. building.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had not intended to suggest during an impromptu White House news conference on Monday that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had not done enough to honor the fallen. Mr. Trump’s words incensed former Obama administration officials.

Mr. Kelly said that he had advised Mr. Trump that presidents generally do not directly call family members of slain service members, and he confirmed that Mr. Obama had not called him when Lieutenant Kelly was killed — as Mr. Trump had alluded to this week.

“That was not a criticism; that was just to simply say, ‘I don’t believe President Obama called,’” Mr. Kelly said. He said that Lieutenant Kelly’s friends in Afghanistan called him in the hours after his son died, and noted that presidents often write condolence letters to grieving military families instead of calling.

“Those are the only phone calls that really mattered,” Mr. Kelly said, his voice cracking. “And yeah, the letters count, to a degree. But there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.”

Mr. Kelly said that he sought refuge during his trip to the national cemetery, surrounded by the gravestones of service members, some of whom “I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.” Mr. Kelly commanded Marines in Iraq in 2008, one of the bloodiest years of the American-led war there.

But even if he found solace at Arlington National Cemetery, he clearly remained angry on Thursday as he addressed reporters. At one point, he would take questions from anyone who is “a Gold Star parent or sibling.” At another, he described the United States as a place that regularly breaches the sacred trusts that had once underpinned a polite society.

“When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country,” Mr. Kelly said. “Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life, the dignity of life, is sacred. That’s gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.”

Mr. Kelly did not explain his critique or say whether he was referring to Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who embraced politics by speaking on behalf of Hillary Clinton last year at the Democratic National Convention.

Nor did he acknowledge the irony in his comments. Many people accused Mr. Trump of failing to respect Gold Star families by attacking Mr. Khan. And Mr. Trump’s behavior toward women in an “Access Hollywood” tape was seen by many as a failure to respect women.

Instead, Mr. Kelly said that he was “sorry” that most Americans are unfamiliar with the young people who fight in the military on behalf of a country that, in his view, takes them for granted.

“We don’t look down upon those of you who haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said before concluding his remarks. “In fact, in a way, we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our servicemen and women do. Not for any other reason than they love this country.”

“So just think of that,” he said. “And I do appreciate your time.”

Back Story

“When something outrages you,” Stéphane Hessel wrote, “as Nazism did me, that is when you become a militant, strong and engaged.”

Born on this day in 1917, Mr. Hessel, a French Resistance hero and Holocaust survivor, became an unlikely publishing phenomenon in 2011 at the age of 93, topping best-seller lists with “Indignez-Vous!”

Photo

At about 4,000 words, “Indignez-Vous!” (“Time for Outrage!”) was more pamphlet than book. But it resonated with French readers gearing up for a presidential election, and with those elsewhere who were protesting the eurozone crisis, participating in the Arab Spring uprisings or occupying Wall Street.

Mr. Hessel urged young people to revive the spirit of the resistance by peacefully protesting the financial markets, France’s treatment of illegal immigrants, the influence of the rich on the news media and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

“Indignez-Vous!” sold more than three million copies in Europe in less than a year and was translated into more than a dozen languages. (The Nation magazine published the full text in English.)

Mr. Hessel died in 2013, but his call to outrage endures: “You join the movement of history,” he wrote, “and the great current of history continues to flow only thanks to each and every one of us.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect. That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts. Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras. The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined — a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.

The Rialto study had a big impact in policing. Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website. A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras. (Results are due out this spring.)

But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington. Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video. The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.

“This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date,” said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues. It was not directly involved in the research. “The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.”

The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more. The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost. In Washington, M.P.D. officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day. About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.

The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations. In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place. Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.

Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.

“D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures,” Mr. Yu said. “In cities that have weaker policies, it’s certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.” Like other advocacy groups, the A.C.L.U. has supported body cameras. But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U. of D.C., “should give us pause.”

For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras. But they admit to being surprised by the findings.

“I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior — particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave,” said the M.P.D. chief, Peter Newsham.

Why didn’t the cameras change behavior? After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior. Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages. Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.

Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, “Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.” Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations — and not elsewhere.

One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them. But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new. (The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.) Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.

An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context. The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters. When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).

“It’s a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior,” said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.

Photo

Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, D.C., because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems. After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the city’s police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.

“We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here,” Chief Newsham said.

Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory. (The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)

Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.

To Chief Newsham, the cameras’ primary benefit is to improve relations with the community. “The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I don’t think you can undervalue that,” he said. So far, it’s hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said he’d like to find out more through additional studies like this one.

The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).

“We like to be very anecdotal in policing — to compare this year to that year,” said M.P.D. Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers. “This study is a whole other thing.”

Daniel Castro Garcia has been awarded the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

Photo

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains — unlike computers — are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.

On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack — all while we should be performing the actual jobs we’re paid to be doing.

“Many people seem unaware that they might accomplish more with sustained, uninterrupted attention to one task,” said Nelson Cowan, a specialist in working memory at the University of Missouri. “It can be exhilarating to flit from one conversation to another on Facebook, but people don’t realize what’s missing in the process. It’s like having a delicious soup poured on your head. Often the people who think they’re the best at sharing attention between tasks are actually missing the most.”

Mr. LeDoux added: “The brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.”

They’re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.

Repeat After Me

As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks — reading, or saying words over and over — continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we’re already convinced we’re productive.

New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It’s the easiest brain game there is.

Take Your Time

Forget cramming. It didn’t work in college, it doesn’t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.

Robert Bjork, the chair of U.C.L.A.’s psychology department, said that quickly stuffing facts into our brains leads us to forget them in the long term (he even filmed a YouTube video series on the subject). When you rehearse knowledge and practice it often, it sticks, research has shown. So if you can incorporate what you’re trying to remember into daily life, ideally over time, your chances of retaining it drastically improve.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the “forgetting curve.”

To get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.

Sit Down and Stay Put

Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley’s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?

“The rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,” Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.

Multiple studies have found that procrastination leads to stress and downright kills focus. Stop engaging in useless tasks like surfing the web and just tackle whatever it is you need to work on. Then watch your focus soar and your memory improve. Dr. Cowan said both perform better when they aren’t cheating on each other pursuing so-called “life hacks.”

Incentivize Moments and Read Cues

Minds wander constantly. For students, adding frequent tests incentivizes focus because they know they’ll be quizzed. Harvard researchers report this approach decreases daydreaming by 50 percent, improving the result.

Daniel Schacter, a psychologist and a co-author of the Harvard study who also wrote “The Seven Sins Of Memory,” said the trick is focus. For some tasks, like online surfing, divided attention sounds harmless, but when we’re behind the wheel, it’s anything but. That forgetfulness can change the course of entire lives, the most serious vulnerability of memory, he added.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Schacter suggests employing cues — visual or verbal for items like keys — to associate places and things. And our electronic devices can help remind us, everything from mobile vaccination and immunization alerts to apps like Waze that can remind you that you left your baby in the car. It can sound silly, but it’s also tragic when we fail.

“Memory is very cue dependent,” he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. “Most say it could never happen to me, but it’s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don’t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.”

He added: “The really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.”

A simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you’re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.

“A lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,” Mr. Schacter said. “Doing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you’re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you’re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

SAN FRANCISCO — In an escalation of its ride-hailing war against Uber, Lyft has begun to explore going public in 2018 and is trying to strengthen its position by raising more capital, including $1 billion in new financing led by an investment arm of Google’s parent company.

Lyft has had talks with investment banks about an initial public offering next year, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the conversations are confidential. Lyft has not decided which bank may become its lead underwriter for an I.P.O., the people said.

To bolster itself ahead of any public offering, Lyft on Thursday said it had raised $1 billion in financing led by CapitalG, a venture investment arm of Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet. The funding values Lyft at $10 billion before the introduction of new capital — a significant jump from the company’s last valuation of $6.9 billion.

The new investment further complicates the convoluted web of financial relationships in the ride-hailing industry, where companies like Lyft and Uber have hauled in enormous amounts of funding from firms that often put money into competing companies.

But the financing also gives Lyft a new and formidable partner in Alphabet. As part of the deal, David Lawee, a venture partner at CapitalG, will take a seat on Lyft’s board of directors. The investment round, which includes other undisclosed participants, remains open.

On the campaign trail, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pointing to rising wages for lower-income workers as part of a broader trumpeting of his economic record. He is hoping that signs of spreading prosperity will help win his governing coalition a renewed majority in Parliament, extending its five-year hold on power.

There are plenty of numbers for the prime minister to boast about. Output has grown for six straight quarters, the first time that has happened in more than a decade. The stock market is at a 21-year high. Jobs are plentiful, with unemployment at just 2.8 percent, the lowest level since the mid-1990s. Even Japan’s longtime economic nemesis, persistent consumer-price deflation, is being kept at bay.

In a television appearance this month, Mr. Abe compared his efforts to ratchet up economic growth — through a mix of stimulus policies widely known as Abenomics — to the 10 way stations that climbers pass on their way up Mount Fuji.

“We’re at Station Seven, and when you’re climbing it’s after that when things get the most difficult,” he said, inviting voters to grant him the chance to shoot for the summit.

Economic policy has taken a back seat in the campaign to other matters, notably national security and dueling claims over whether Mr. Abe used his influence to help right-wing supporters. A new opposition party created by Tokyo’s popular governor, Yuriko Koike, a former ally of Mr. Abe’s, has seen its support in the polls weaken after a promising start.

If Mr. Abe’s party, the Liberal Democratic Party, wins on Sunday, as appears to be likely, entrenched structural issues will be his next target, he said. His party has promised to increase spending on child care and education in a bid to encourage families to have more children and reverse an accelerating decline in Japan’s population, which has held back economic growth.

The opposition has struggled to formulate a counterattack. One challenge for Mr. Abe’s rivals is that the prime minister is a conservative who spends like a liberal. Though his policies have benefited business — he has cut corporate taxes and brought about a devaluation of the yen, giving Japanese companies with big overseas operations like Toyota Motor a leg up on foreign competitors — there has been no painful austerity to rally against.

Opposition parties have instead seized on a longstanding point of controversy: Japan’s sales tax. The national tax is scheduled to rise in 2019, to 10 percent from the current 8 percent, but Ms. Koike’s party and other groups say they would call off the increase if elected.

Mr. Abe, who has already delayed the rise once, says he will allow it to go ahead but will divert more of the money to social programs, rather than use it to bring down Japan’s chronic budget deficit, as was initially planned. A proposal to balance Japan’s budget, excluding interest payments on debt, by 2020 has been quietly set aside.

How a TV Critic Manages a Franchise

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Of course, “Star Trek” isn’t just any story.
It would be malpractice for a TV critic not to know anything about “Star Trek.” I’d watched each of the series, more (“Deep Space Nine”) or less (sorry, “Enterprise”).
To an extent, my job is to know something about “Star Trek,” but simultaneously make myself forget it.
Some franchise fans have criticized the new series for breaking with the optimistic tone of past series.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
This is great. But it’s not really my gig. As the chief television critic for a general-interest newspaper, as I’ve been for just over two years, my job is to be a grazer, a sampler, a dabbler. I don’t believe that there’s a hierarchy of fandom — that fans who have logged more eyeball-hours supporting a franchise are more authentic than other fans, and thus have greater ownership of the story.

So I write for the center of the “Star Trek” bell curve: the fan who may have seen a lot of the previous programs, or a little, or none at all, but who’s interested in “Discovery.” (This, by the way, is probably fine for the “Trek” superfan, who in today’s vast media cosmos can find plenty of more-targeted reviews from the standpoint of completists.)

Of course, “Star Trek” isn’t just any story. It’s part of our national mythology, a continuing megastory whose characters come to represent our abstract ideals. It would be malpractice for a TV critic not to know anything about “Star Trek.” I’d watched each of the series, more (“Deep Space Nine”) or less (sorry, “Enterprise”).

This kind of question — how much does the source material matter? — comes up more often as pop culture has become dominated by adaptations (“Game of Thrones”), revivals (“The X-Files”), reboots (“Dynasty”), sequels (“Fuller House”), prequels (“Young Sheldon”) and remakes of adaptations (“The Tick”).

It’s as if we were trapped in a time loop reliving the past … not unlike the “Star Trek: The Next Generation” crew in the episode “Cause and Effect.”

My philosophy is that any work needs to stand on its own: If I need to have read the source book to really “get” a TV series, then it’s not a good series. It’s not an iron rule, of course. Good luck understanding “Twin Peaks: The Return” if you didn’t see the original. (Then again, good luck even if you did see the original.)

Likewise, part of what I need to ask about a show like “Discovery” is: If it weren’t associated with this brand, would I want to watch any more of it? To an extent, my job is to know something about “Star Trek,” but simultaneously make myself forget it.

I address some of these meta-questions in my review of “Discovery,” which I wrote after watching six episodes. Some franchise fans have criticized the new series for breaking with the optimistic tone of past series. I don’t have that problem, although I had other issues. Franchises stay vital by remaking themselves for their times, not by pledging allegiance to the past. Just as Batman could be a camp icon in the 1960s and a brooding antihero in the 21st century, so can “Trek” complicate itself for the era of complex TV.

Of course, it’s not just critics who have to think about this. The creators of a work like “Star Trek: Discovery” have to keep multiple audiences in mind. After all, CBS was probably counting on the passionate “Trek” fan base to drive subscriptions to its All Access streaming service.

But a franchise also needs new fans to grow. If you become too beholden to callbacks and timelines, you risk becoming less a storyteller and more of a custodian. It’s a big universe, and “Star Trek” belongs to all of it.

Emily Sarokin may not have completely understood how a major auction house worked when she joined Christie’s New York six years ago.

“I thought it was ‘Antiques Roadshow,’” Ms. Sarokin, the vice president and director of gallery operations and client services, said in a recent interview at the Rockefeller Center gallery, laughing at herself as she prepared for the Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art auction in mid-September. “I had no idea.”

She knows now that it is “an immense machine.” In 2016, there were 84 sales and more than 100 exhibitions at Christie’s New York location alone. They involved art and other precious goods worth about 1.5 billion pounds. That is almost $2 billion (but employees tend to think in British currency because the head office is in London, where the company was founded in 1766).

The number of details involved in creating any one of those events in 57,000 square feet of Midtown exhibition space is complicated. Ms. Sarokin, 29, described working intensely and constantly with shippers, contractors, riggers, lawyers and (of course) the art handlers.

How to Walk Out of the Louvre With a Masterpiece

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Stars glitter and worlds collide in Todd Haynes’s “Wonderstruck,” a lovely ode to imagination and to the stories that make us who we are. A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.

Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.

Photo

Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.

“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.

Video

Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.

“I haven’t spoke to you since 17/Just thought I’d let you know you’re dead to me,” he lovingly sings on the spooky, abraded “Clarity in Kerosene,” one of the album’s most anguished songs. At the chorus, Mr. Mulherin toggles back and forth between shrieking and soothing, and in the verses, he alternates between a kind of whispered, conspiratorial singing and nimble rapping.

The music is similarly piercing and caressing. Mr. Mulherin often plays with an arid electric guitar tone redolent of lonely folk music. “I’m really into open tunings,” he said. “There’s something about that tone that’s chilly, that’s kind of cold and removed.” His beats are urgent and dark. (He produced the album with the punk producer Erik Ron and JayVee, a SoundCloud collaborator.)

The music of nothing,nowhere. is an intriguing turn for emo, which has been through at least four waves, and has been celebrating a revival by classicist-minded new bands in recent years. Mr. Mulherin is a devotee of the genre’s older standard-bearers — “I never stopped listening to these bands,” he said of groups like Mineral and the Promise Ring. But he’s part of a young, still relatively fringe group of artists, largely gathered on SoundCloud, that is melding vintage emo with contemporary hip-hop production, finding unlikely kinship.

In the way that the rise of Drake portended the final obliteration of the wall between hip-hop and R&B, the music of nothing,nowhere. — along with other SoundCloud-first artists including Lil Peep — helps bridge the chasm between rock and hip-hop. Unlike the rap-rock of a decade and a half ago, which was often clunky, expressed via brute force and a constant reminder of its forebears, Mr. Mulherin’s blend is seamless and intuitive.

That’s clearest on the ethereal and sinewy “Hopes Up,” which features a guest appearance by the emo godfather Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional.

Mr. Carrabba likened nothing,nowhere.’s embrace of hip-hop to his own generation’s engagement with hardcore: “Some of the trappings are similar: posturing, hypermasculine, not necessarily inclusive, cocky and braggadocious,” he said in a phone interview. “Joe seems to have embraced the best pieces of that and laid the tropes aside. That’s where I see a connection to our generation.”

Mr. Mulherin still has the voice mail saved on his phone of Mr. Carrabba agreeing to sing on the track and asking “to hear more of your music just because I’m kind of obsessed with this song.” He said hearing that kind of praise from someone he looked up to “really puts wind in my sails, because I’m not the most confident person.”

Mr. Mulherin was raised in Foxborough, Mass. but spent summers in this part of Vermont. By the time he began taking guitar lessons at 12, he was already immersed in the bruising rap-rock of the era, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park (“my first vulnerable band”), and also emo and post-hardcore bands like Taking Back Sunday, Thursday and Senses Fail.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — We’re over the hump of the week and cruising toward the weekend, so no long faces. Even if you’re having a “meh” week, we have at least two reasons to smile.

While today’s puzzle does not have the Thursday high-wire tricks we’ve come to expect, Alan Arbesfeld’s offering is relatively easy and should allow even new solvers to experience a degree of success.

Mr. Arbesfeld has also spent some time remaking movies to give them more uplifting titles. If you hang out on Twitter, this theme might feel familiar: It’s the game people play where they change a word to make a different phrase. This one might be given the hashtag #makeamoviemoreuplifting.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Arbesfeld offers us four movie titles that are kind of lackluster and changes a word to make each a bit happier. For example, at 26A, the “Uplifting remake of a 2010 Annette Bening/Julianne Moore film?” is based on the movie “The Kids Are All Right” and is remade as THE KIDS ARE SUPER.

Similarly, and this was my favorite of the bunch, at 51A, the “Uplifting remake of a 1964 Audrey Hepburn/Rex Harrison film?” is based on “My Fair Lady” and is remade as MY AWESOME LADY.

Yet while Mr. Murphy is comfortably ahead, Mr. Northam is locked in a competitive race. A former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a Washington establishment fixture, Mr. Gillespie has turned to more hard-line tactics in an effort to win over both swing voters and Mr. Trump’s supporters.

While Virginia is increasingly Democratic — Mr. Obama carried it twice — voter turnout plummets when it holds its governor’s election the year after a presidential vote. And that often results in an electorate that is older and whiter than what is reflected in White House races.

Mr. Obama pointedly invoked this trend.

“Sometimes y’all get a little sleepy, get a little complacent,” he said of Democrats in off-year elections, warning that they would have no right to complain about their elected officials if they “slept through” Election Day.

Speaking directly to young Virginians, the 56-year-old former president, wearing a suit but no tie, tried his hand at millennial vernacular: “I think it’s great that you hashtag and meme, but I need you to vote,” Mr. Obama said.

While avoiding any direct discussion of his successor, Mr. Obama offered his harshest assessment of the Trump era since leaving the White House.

“Instead of our politics reflecting our values, we’ve got politics infecting our communities,” he said.

As they spoke at the rally, Mr. Northam and the Democratic governor he hopes to succeed, Terry McAuliffe, were, however, glad to link Mr. Trump and Mr. Gillespie.

“He’s nothing more than a Washington lobbyist who’s now become Donald Trump’s chief lobbyist,” said Mr. Northam, adding that “we cannot accept that this is the new normal.”

Mr. McAuliffe, who is thought to be considering a White House bid, was even more succinct about Mr. Gillespie’s attempt to straddle between Trump loyalists and Trump skeptics. “Ed Gillespie is treating the president of his party like a communicable disease,” the governor said.

If Mr. Obama demurred from a frontal assault that could provoke the Twitter-happy president, he was eager to depict Mr. Gillespie as a Trump stand-in.

Mr. Gillespie until recently had been linking Mr. Northam to MS-13 by pointing out that the Democrat opposed a measure in the State Senate that would have banned sanctuary cities in Virginia. (No localities in the state have tried to become sanctuary cities.)

Noting that Mr. Northam, an Army veteran, is a child neurologist, Mr. Obama said that it “strains credulity” to think that the lieutenant governor is “suddenly cozying up to street gangs.”

But Mr. Obama went well beyond mockery, accusing Mr. Gillespie of “fanning anti-immigrant sentiment” and all but calling him a hypocrite for airing the ad after he spent years warning other Republicans to stay away from such a divisive issue.

“He’s gone on record in the past condemning the very same kind of rhetoric that he’s using right now,” Mr. Obama said, careful to avoid mentioning Mr. Gillespie by name.

The Republican’s campaign, perhaps wanting to avoid a quarrel with a former president still popular here, offered a muted response to Mr. Obama’s broadsides.

“It’s no surprise President Obama would level Lieutenant Governor Northam’s attacks against Ed at a Northam campaign event,” said David Abrams, Mr. Gillespie’s spokesman.

Mr. Obama was far more restrained discussing Mr. Gillespie’s criticism of Mr. Northam for supporting the removal of Virginia’s Confederate statues.

Speaking in a former capital of the Confederacy, Richmond, a city whose most stately boulevard is lined with monuments to the leaders of the Lost Cause, the former president did not directly mention the statues.

“We shouldn’t use the most painful parts of our history just to score political points,” Mr. Obama said.

He did, though, draw laughs by noting that he is a distant relative of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, who is chiseled in marble a few miles away.

Democrats hoped Mr. Obama’s appearance would rouse African-Americans in this city, where about half the population is black, and across central Virginia.

Mr. Obama, Democratic Party officials said, may be one of the few figures famous enough to draw attention away from Mr. Trump, whose near-daily pronouncements and provocations have overshadowed this race.

Yet while Mr. Obama’s return to the campaign trail was sure to draw ample news coverage — 18 cameras lined a riser in the back of the hall — it was less clear whether he could transfer his loyal following to Mr. Northam.

Democrats suffered grievous down-ballot losses during Mr. Obama’s presidency in off-year elections, including the governorships of Virginia and New Jersey in 2009, when he similarly sought to rally African-American voters. Those losses presaged the Tea Party-fueled Republican sweep in 2010, a year that saw Republicans seize statehouses across the country to take control of the decennial redistricting process.

In New Jersey, Mr. Obama sought to frame the race between Mr. Murphy and Ms. Guadagno as an opportunity to right the course in a country that he saw as faltering in its role as an example to the world.

“The world counts on America having its act together,” he said.

“You can’t take this election, or any election, for granted,” he added, and then paused before continuing, “I don’t know if you all noticed that.”

The audience reacted with laughter followed by muted sighs.

When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Murphy was more blunt in criticizing Mr. Trump’s record. He alluded to Mr. Trump’s decision to end a program started by Mr. Obama that protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation and said, “Dreamers, and we’ve got 22,000 in this state, are every bit as American as our four kids and are being shown the door.”

Mr. Murphy said that in the Trump era, “governors will never have mattered more,” and he promised that he would stand up to the president.

Indeed after the game, Cubs Manager Joe Maddon acknowledged how hard it had been for his team to get going this season after winning the World Series a year ago, the team’s first title in 108 years. “That’s what the World Series hangover is,” he said.

In contrast, the Dodgers, who won 104 games in the regular season, the most in baseball, have looked energized since the postseason began, and have lost only once so far — a 3-2 defeat in Game 4 on Wednesday that kept the Cubs’ faint hopes alive for one more day.

Appropriately enough, the winning pitcher on Thursday night was Clayton Kershaw, the three-time Cy Young Award winner. He was on the mound a year ago when the Cubs hit him around and clinched the N.L.C.S. But on Thursday night, Kershaw allowed only one run over six stout innings to finally earn a pennant to put on his résumé.

And outfielder Enrique Hernandez, who epitomizes the Dodgers’ roster of versatile players, supplied nearly all the offense himself by smashing a solo home run, a two-run shot and a grand slam to tie a postseason single-game record of seven R.B.I.

“It’s been a long time,” a jubilant Kershaw, who became a Dodger in 2008, said afterward. “It’s not erased yet. We have to win four more games, but ever since I came to the organization it’s been ‘1988, 1988.’ It’s the year I was born, so I know all this stuff. We want to make it ‘2017.’ ”

Entering this season, the Dodgers had made 10 playoff appearances since their last World Series run in 1988, when they beat Oakland in five games, but not once could they reach the final round. No other team in baseball has played in the postseason that many consecutive times without at least one trip to the Series.

In that frustrating span, the Dodgers reached the N.L.C.S. four times — 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2016 — but stumbled each year. They have also won five straight N.L. West division titles, including this year, but were bounced from the postseason earlier than they hoped each time — until now.

At the start of this decade the Dodgers went through franchise turbulence, and eventually Frank McCourt was replaced as owner of the team by Guggenheim Baseball Management, a group led by the billionaire Mark Walter.

The Dodgers began to spend, a lot. Since the start of the 2014 season, it has been they, not the Yankees, who have had the highest payroll in baseball. But the Dodgers also hired Andrew Friedman, then the general manager of the small-market and small-budget Tampa Bay Rays, to head the baseball operations.

“This ownership came in and did what they said, gave us the tools and gave us the personnel and gave us anything and everything we needed to win, and it was up to us players to achieve that,” said outfielder Andre Ethier, the longest tenured Dodger, who has been in the organization since 2006.

And while they spent $192 million over the off-season to keep three of their best players — third baseman Justin Turner, starter Rich Hill, and closer Kenley Jansen — they also filled the roster with both cheaper relievers, such as Josh Fields and Brandon Morrow, and talented young players like shortstop Corey Seager, who was the N.L. Rookie of the Year last year but did not play in this series because of a back injury, and first baseman Cody Bellinger, who may win the award this year.

The last time the Dodgers reached the World Series they were led by Manager Tommy Lasorda, pitcher Orel Hershiser and outfielder Kirk Gibson. Lasorda is now 90 and he ambled on to the field at Wrigley Field before Thursday’s game to watch the current crop of Dodgers take batting practice.

And then he went and sat in the stands and looked on as the current Dodgers put Game 5 away quickly.

“Wouldn’t it be great to play the Yankees?” Lasorda said after the game. “It puts the entire nation, from here to here, all into the baseball view. That’s going to be, if they win it, a great series.”

Bellinger’s run-scoring double started the scoring in the first inning. Hernandez saw two pitches combined in his first two at-bats against Cubs starter Jose Quintana, swung twice, and produced two home runs.

After the third-inning grand slam, Hernandez threw a fist into the air as he rounded first base. The Dodgers dugout bounced with glee, and welcomed Hernandez with vigorous high-fives and hugs. Cubs fans could only grimace. They had rejoiced last fall when the Cubs finally ended their epic title drought and probably knew, considering the Cubs’ tortured history, that two titles in a row was far-fetched. Still, watching their team get eliminated at Wrigley Field had to sting, although many of them stuck around as the one-sided game dragged on.

Meanwhile, Hernandez just kept going. In the ninth inning, he added his third and final home run, joining players such as Albert Pujols and Reggie Jackson, who have hit three home runs in a postseason game. And after the inning was over, the Dodgers celebrated more forcefully, finally earning a World Series berth after so many failed attempts.

Another shift at Ballet Theater has been the absence of foreign guest stars. (The non-Americans onstage Wednesday appear with the company all year round.) This policy may well prove controversial among Ballet Theater loyalists, many of whom care far more to see visiting luminaries than evidence of any ensemble style. Just now, doubts — only subtle, nothing intense, but central to the company’s identity — attach chiefly to Mr. Ratmansky. The poetic visions of his dances lack the spectacular impact those old-school loyalists crave.

The evening’s two premieres were Ms. Lang’s “The Gift” and Mr. Ratmansky’s “Songs of Bukovina”; the evening ended with Christopher Wheeldon’s “Thirteen Diversions” (2011). “The Gift” and “Thirteen Diversions” both seem perfect fare for a Ballet Theater gala. They have just enough old-style classicism to reassure the conservatives that the home fires still burn bright, just enough modernity to seem of the moment, and just enough brilliance to supply a rush of easy excitement.

Ms. Lang’s “The Gift” begins (like an advertisement) with taped testimonies from young artists about the rewards of dancing. But it goes on to use its music (excerpts from a Corelli concerto grosso) skilfully, for dozens of dancers (students, studio company, apprentices), with theatrical entrances, sequences, formations and exits. And the smooth ensemble casually includes same-sex lifts as well as conventional lifts of women by men. True, “The Gift” felt all preamble and postlude: It built up to, and then away from, a main dance event that never occurred. More, please.

“Thirteen Diversions,” for four star male-female couples and a corps of eight women and eight men, is as polished a work as the skilled Mr. Wheeldon has ever made. It includes lyricism and virtuosity, striking effects of through-the-body lines and symmetrical ensemble geometry. The music is Britten’s “Diversions” for piano (left-hand) and orchestra. Bob Crowley’s costumes (white for the leads, black with lime trimming for the corps) are super-elegant; Brad Fields’s lighting (separate zones of light, darkness and purple color) makes the entire theatrical space dramatic.

For many, Mr. Wheeldon’s choreography exemplifies the kind of impressive classicism they want Ballet Theater to exemplify. But I don’t care for what little I find underneath its bright surface. Men and women rush all too eagerly into various kinds of automatic rapture — and men seem keener to manipulate women than to converse with them.

“Songs of Bukovina,” by contrast, wants to look more mild and derivative than it really is. It’s an example of the piano ballet, a genre immortalized by Jerome Robbins in “Dances at a Gathering.” A pianist beside the stage plays music suffused by (almost invariably) Eastern European folk material, while dancers, in individuated costumes with hints of (almost invariably) Eastern European folk color, suggest atmosphere, emotion, memory, community. This one even has, as in Robbins’s “Gathering,” five women and five men; only its structure is more orthodox (one lead couple, with four pairs as backing group).

In this case, the music is new: excerpts from Leonid Desyatnikov’s “Bukovinian Songs (24 Preludes for Piano).” Alexey Goribol played the score, which showed, as did the choreography, that Bukovina, an area now divided between Romania and Ukraine, plainly has colors, rhythms and steps all its own.

There are unusual effects of suspense and contrast. Several dances end with people balanced on one leg, as if in midsentence. The ballerina, handsomely dressed by Moritz Junge in red, walks firmly on flat feet in one phrase, as if weighted by her sense of destiny and homeland. But when the pulse changes, she spins brilliantly in finger fouetté turns (the famous ballet step, but here sustained by the male dancer’s hand guiding the woman’s hand raised above her head). This isn’t Mr. Ratmansky’s most individual ballet, but I want to get to know it better: the only dance of Wednesday’s gala of which this can be said.

The gala’s greatest hit was a short film documentary about Project Plié, which since 2013 has been bringing racially and ethnically diverse children to ballet. Touchingly, attractively, the film showed children discovering both ballet and, by way of dance, themselves.

Ms. Copeland — never more charming — introduced the man who has done most for the project, Valentino D. Carlotti. Another documentary, paying tribute to Mr. McKenzie, was also effective, showing us the artistic qualities he brings to ballet rehearsal while successfully portraying him as an amiably safe pair of hands who wants (and achieves) nothing but to keep Ballet Theater going in the same old way, keeping artistic standards high.

The gala and the coming season, however, show that he and Mr. Ratmansky have been revising the company. I applaud, and hope further change and further debate lie ahead.

Before his appointment, Lloyd made it clear that he believes the government has the right to exercise veto power over women’s reproductive decisions. Writing in The National Catholic Register in 2009, he proposed that women receiving Title X family planning assistance forfeit the option to end their pregnancies. “I suggest that the American people make a deal with women: So long as you are using the condom, pill or patch I am providing with my money, you are going to promise not to have an abortion if the contraception fails, which it often does,” he wrote. “You will put the baby up for adoption if you don’t want him or her. We can do this by having the woman sign a pledge.”

At O.R.R., Lloyd quickly availed himself of the opportunity to exercise power over young women’s pregnancy decisions. According to a suit the A.C.L.U. filed on Doe’s behalf, Lloyd “has personally contacted one or more unaccompanied immigrant minors who was pregnant and seeking abortion, and discussed with them their decision to have an abortion.”

In a March case just before Lloyd officially took over at O.R.R., the suit says, the office intervened in the middle of a girl’s medication abortion, which had been authorized by a judge. The girl had taken a dose of mifepristone, the first part of the medical abortion regimen, to be followed within 48 hours by a dose of misoprostol. But before she could take the second medication, O.R.R.’s acting director at the time, Ken Tota, ordered her to be taken to an emergency room to see if the pregnancy could be saved. (She was eventually allowed to complete the abortion.)

Evidently, word went down to the shelter where Doe was housed that, despite the judicial authorization she’d received, the staff was not to cooperate with her abortion. On Sept. 23, her lawyers say, she was taken to an anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center, where she was forced to view an ultrasound. One of her lawyers told me that Lloyd had the shelter call Doe’s mother in her home country to tell her about the pregnancy, even though she said her mother was physically abusive. Throughout all this, Rochelle Garza, Doe’s court-appointed guardian, told me that the girl remained “unwavering in her decision to terminate the pregnancy despite the emotional abuse that she is enduring.”

A legal battle ensued. While it was fought, Garza said, the girl was placed under constant one-on-one supervision, and barred from all physical activity. When the shelter’s residents were taken on an outing to the park, Doe was made to sit on a bench while the other kids played. “They’re holding her hostage,” Amiri told me. “This is the most insane case I’ve ever worked on in my career.” (The Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees O.R.R., sent me a statement about ensuring “our country does not become an open sanctuary for taxpayer-supported abortions by minors crossing the border illegally.” It did not respond to specific questions.)

On Oct. 18, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order requiring the administration to stop blocking Doe’s abortion. Now a second-trimester procedure, it was scheduled for Oct. 20. But the Trump administration made a successful appeal, so instead there will be another round of arguments on that day. It’s not yet clear when or even if Doe will finally be able to terminate her pregnancy. Abortion in Texas is mostly illegal after 20 weeks.

Amiri seems genuinely shocked by the administration’s intransigence. “The amount of opposition to this young women’s abortion is just astounding,” she said. “And they continue to double down over and over again. Every step of the way, I think at some point justice will prevail and there will be some sense from the federal government that the rule of law prohibits what they’re doing, but they keep taking it to the next level.”

When it comes to controlling women’s bodies, the only limit is what they can get away with.

Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism

Intel, July 2007A 2007 ad for Intel’s new processor showed a white man surrounded by six black sprinters bent over in starting poses.
Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.
“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.
Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit.

She added that Dove had removed the post and was “re-evaluating our internal processes for creating and reviewing content.” She declined to say how many people reviewed the ad or whether any of them were African-American.

Critics were unimpressed by the company’s apology.

“What was the mark?” the Facebook user Ariel Macklin wrote in a comment that was liked more than 1,100 times. “I mean anyone with eyes can see how offensive this is. Not one person on your staff objected to this? Wow. Will not be buying your products anymore.”

Dove’s ad was not an isolated case by one company, but the latest in a long line of tone-deaf ads by many companies.

Here are a few examples from the past.

Intel, July 2007

A 2007 ad for Intel’s new processor showed a white man surrounded by six black sprinters bent over in starting poses. “Multiply computing performance and maximize the power of your employees,” the text read.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

It’s when you see a clue like 8D’s “Candy ass?” and, after fanning yourself and wondering what ever happened to the good old Gray Lady, you think that the answer has to have something to do with being weak. But it doesn’t, does it? No, the ass in this clue is a donkey, and Mr. Walden has once again taken us the long way around to realizing that he means PIÑATA.

“It’s dangerous for a woman to camp alone,” I finally said at the table that night. “There are women who do it, but I’m not that brave.”

My children grew up with stories of their father’s adventures. They did not grow up with stories of mine. I didn’t tell them the story of the 16-year-old family “friend” who babysat while his parents and mine went out to dinner the year I was 11, how he followed me around the apartment, tugging on my blouse and telling me I should take it off, pulling at the elastic waistband of my pants and telling me I should take them off, how I finally locked myself in my bedroom and didn’t come out till my parents got home.

I didn’t tell my children the story of walking with my friend to the town hardware store when we were 14. I didn’t tell them that my friend used her babysitting money to buy a screwdriver and a deadbolt lock to keep her older brother out of her room at night.

I didn’t tell my children the story of my first job, the job I started the week I turned 16, and how the manager kept making excuses to go back to the storeroom whenever I was at the fry station, how he would squeeze his corpulent frame between the counter and me, dragging his sweaty crotch across my rear end on each trip.

I didn’t tell my children about the time in graduate school when I had to call the police because there was a man crouching in the bushes next to my front steps, or about the former professor who told me that my impending marriage put an end to the “longest-running act of foreplay” he had ever engaged in. What I had thought of as an avuncular interest in my career he had thought of as an unrealized act of seduction.

There is nothing unusual about these stories. They are the ho-hum, everyday experiences of virtually every woman I know, and such stories rarely get told. There will never be a powerful social-media movement that begins, “Today I ate breakfast” or “Today my dog pooped and I cleaned it up” or “Today I washed my hair with the same shampoo I’ve been buying since 2006.” We tell the stories that are remarkable in some way, stories that are surprising, utterly unexpected. The quotidian doesn’t make for a good tale.

And maybe that’s why the avalanche of stories on Twitter and Facebook this week has been so powerful. It started on Oct. 5, when The New York Times first broke the story of accusations of sexual harassment against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, but it became a juggernaut 10 days later, when the actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.” Within minutes the hashtag #MeToo was all over Twitter, Facebook and Instagram — over 500,000 times on Twitter and 12 million times on Facebook in the first 24 hours alone — and the deluge shows no sign of slowing. The numbers keep ticking up as women tell the stories of men who used their power to overwhelm or coerce them.

I don’t know any woman who is surprised by these stories, or by the sheer, vast numbers of them. But men are. Some — by one account 300,000 of them — are writing to point out that they have been harassed, too, because of course the abuse of power isn’t gender- or orientation-specific. Others have started their own hashtag: #IHearYou. These are men, like my sons, who have not consistently heard these stories before because for too long women have not considered them stories worth telling. Or because too often such stories are not believed.

It’s an irony worth pointing out that the novel I was telling my children about at dinner that night was “Room” by Emma Donoghue, the story of a woman who was kidnapped from her college campus and kept as a sex slave in a backyard shed. Even reading that beautiful, heartbreaking book, it had not occurred to me to tell my children the story of all the times I wanted to go camping or hiking or traveling myself but didn’t dare because I couldn’t find anyone to go with me.

We have bigger things in this country to worry about than whether producers in Hollywood are sexual predators, and the #MeToo movement is bound to fade again into the background, the way it did after the Bill Cosby allegations came to national prominence, the way it did after accusations against Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly. In fact, the first Me Too movement was begun 10 years ago by the African-American activist Tarana Burke, and yet here we are again.

This kind of activism inevitably moves out of the news cycle when the possibility of thermonuclear war becomes a more pressing concern, when global warming becomes a more pressing concern, when desperate refugees in mortal danger become a more pressing concern, when women’s ability to make decisions about their own bodies becomes a more pressing concern, when millions of uninsured Americans become a more pressing concern. The list of urgent dangers we now face goes on and on and on. But it’s worth noting that most of them can be directly attributed to a man who boasted of being able to violate women at will, and face no consequences at all.

Puerto Ricans Ask: When Will the Lights Come Back On?

Logistical challenges — like where to house the thousands of extra workers needed to get the lights back on — still have not been resolved.

In contrast with Texas after Hurricane Harvey and Florida after Irma, where thousands of repair workers rushed in to restring power lines, only a few hundred electrical workers from outside the island have arrived to help.

It was not until Saturday that the Puerto Rican government said it had the federal funding needed to bring in more workers. And until a week ago, the small Montana company hired to get the lights back on had only 165 workers on the ground; it now has about 300.

In comparison, 5,300 workers from outside the region converged on coastal Texas in the days after Hurricane Harvey to restore a power loss that was about a tenth the size, said Larry Jones, a spokesman for AEP Texas. Electricity was back on for almost everyone within two weeks.

In Florida, 18,000 outside workers went in after Hurricane Irma knocked out electricity to most of the state last month, according to FPL, Florida’s largest power company.

In Puerto Rico, the brunt of the work has been left to the 900 members of local crews.

Industry experts said poor planning, a slow response by power officials and Puerto Rico’s dire financial straits had led to a situation that would be unfathomable in the continental United States. Logistical challenges — like where to house the thousands of extra workers needed to get the lights back on — still have not been resolved.

“Thirty days after the storm, I see very little progress,” said Eduardo Bhatia, an opposition senator who in 2014 wrote an energy reform law. He added, “I don’t see the boots on the field doing the work, and that is a tragedy.”

At the White House on Thursday, President Trump said the administration deserved a 10 for its response to the hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico and other parts of the United States.

But he conceded that the destruction of the power grid was one of Puerto Rico’s biggest long-term challenges, despite the provision of “massive numbers” of generators to temporarily provide electricity to hospitals and other crucial facilities.

“You can’t really bring electric back until you rebuild the power plant,” Mr. Trump said during an appearance with Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico. The federal government will help rebuild the power grid, he said, but “the plant itself is going to take a while.”

In Gurabo, just outside Caguas, Reynaldo De Hostos spends most of his time outside seeking relief from insufferable indoor heat. “Ever since we lost electricity, we can’t sleep,” he said, standing inside his pitch-dark home. Every hour or so at night, he said, he and his family use the air-conditioning in the car for a brief respite.

Even local utility employees are frustrated. “We need trucks, we need poles, we need crews, we need lines, we need more people,” said Javier Hernández Saurí, a lineman who led a team of repair workers making their way up Mr. Rodríguez’s street. “It’s going very slowly.”

He added, “We’re rewiring mostly with materials that can be reused.”

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with restoring Puerto Rico’s power, estimated that it needed at least 2,000 additional workers. So far, the Corps has brought only about 200 workers, and most of them were dedicated not to restoring power but to installing generators at crucial locations.

After major storms, power companies typically rely on mutual aid agreements to get electricity restored. Outside companies send thousands of workers, and electric companies pay for the service with funds from FEMA.

Such agreements are “absolutely critical,” said Devon Streit, the deputy assistant secretary for infrastructure security at the Department of Energy, which is helping to coordinate the restoration of power. But in this instance, some companies were concerned about getting paid, she said, because the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, had filed for bankruptcy protection in July after defaulting on $9 billion in debt.

Ricardo Ramos, chief executive of the power authority, said outside companies had been hesitant to come until they knew where the storm would make landfall. After that, he needed several days to assess the damage, and communications were down.

By the time Mr. Ramos had a full grasp of the damage a week after the storm, he said, the Corps of Engineers had been tasked with overseeing power restoration, a duty outside its usual purview.

That was something of a relief, Mr. Ramos said, because mutual aid agreements cost millions of dollars that the power authority cannot spare.

“With the Corps of Engineers, they do the work, they pay for it, and they get reimbursed by FEMA,” he said. “So it never goes through my pocket.”

The Montana company he hired, Whitefish Energy Holdings, agreed to do the work without a down payment. The chief executive, Andy Techmanski, said that he got the contract because he showed up in Puerto Rico unannounced.

Mr. Ramos expressed no regrets.

“I mobilized what I could, which was private contractors, and I am happy with the decision. I would do exactly the same,” he said. “I think we’re right on target.”

The Corps of Engineers did not announce its large contract, for $240 million, until this week. An earlier $35 million contract was for mobile gas turbines, but the Corps said it did not know when the companies would be sending employees to Puerto Rico.

Brig. Gen. Diana Holland, the commander of the Corps’ South Atlantic Division, said the contracting process went “really quickly,” despite the fact that taxpayers demand a careful review of such emergency contracts.

For now, thousands of power poles remain on the ground. Most Puerto Ricans survive by storing food in ice chests or eating in the few open restaurants. They swat mosquitoes that fly in through the open windows, and some wait in line for hours to get ice. With about a third of the island’s bank branches still closed, lines snake around the block for access to cash machines.

“Last night, someone tried to break into my house and into two of my neighbors’ houses to steal. They tried to force the lock on our door,” said Mario Luis Casanova Caballero, a lineman working with Mr. Hernández Saurí who was using a generator to power his lights and to help keep refrigerators running for three neighbors.

When Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989, Mr. Ramos said, repairs took six months.

But on Saturday, Governor Rosselló committed to a more aggressive timetable, pledging to have 95 percent of power restored by December. His public affairs secretary, Ramón Rosario Cortés, acknowledged that the crews in place were not enough.

“We have 230 brigades. If we used only these brigades, we’d be talking long months — years,” Mr. Rosario said.

The governor said an additional 966 brigades would be trickling in over the next three weeks.

The number of workers, however, is not the only problem. The Corps of Engineers said damage to the island’s ports had slowed shipments of needed equipment, including utility poles and cable.

The task is also daunting, Mr. Ramos said, because some of the power plants date to the 1950s and were never maintained. Power was restored to parts of San Juan three times in the last few weeks, only for the grid to collapse.

As he waits, Mr. Rodríguez tries to get by the best that he can.

Generators are expensive, he said, and hard to find. And lines at the supermarket remain long.

“I buy our drinking water in Costco,” he said. “I made a three-hour line on Sunday to buy eight gallons of water. That’s what we’re surviving on.”

A Madoff Gets a Makeover, by Giving Them

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Don’t think that you’re staring at some girl who has it all because let me tell you what happened to me,’” Ms. Mack said.
A blind date with an older, divorced man named Mark Madoff led to a second date, then a third.
“We had a really, really nice life,” Ms. Mack said.
Ms. Mack said the months after were a blur of heartbreak, anger, financial uncertainty and shame.
“Somebody gets set up on a date with me, they can find out everything about me,” Ms. Mack said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
She also has something perhaps more valuable: intimate knowledge of loss, grief and starting over, and a determination to be something other than just a footnote in the Madoff saga.

“I don’t want to get defined by Bernie Madoff and his crimes. I don’t want to be defined by the fact that my husband killed himself,” Ms. Mack, 43, said recently, sitting at the kitchen counter of her apartment in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, where she and her two children, 8 and 10, have lived since 2016. “There are thousands of other stylists and personal shoppers who do the same thing I do, but I wanted to get back out there again.”

She’s not in the market mainly for ball gowns, either. For $200 an hour, with a three-hour minimum, Ms. Mack helps clients choose simple pieces like the best jeans (her own, on this day, were by Mother, worn with a white Hanes T-shirt and black Converse sneakers) and the kicky accessories to go with them. She loves a good beanie. She sits in closets, making notes on Post-its, listening and nodding. Sometimes clients will talk about their recent breakup, or divorce.

“That’s when I’m like, ‘Listen. Don’t think that you’re staring at some girl who has it all because let me tell you what happened to me,’” Ms. Mack said. “When you’re in that position, of something bad that’s happened to you, you feel very alone. I felt very alone in my crisis. In my family disaster. You feel like you’re the only person it’s happening to.”

Where Bernard Madoff focused his career on obscuring as much as possible, Ms. Mack’s approach is the opposite.

“I wasn’t going to hide,” she said. “I have nothing to hide.”

The Young Widow

Until December 2008, Ms. Mack’s story read like a spec script for “Sex and the City.”

The oldest of two children, she was raised on the Upper East Side, mostly by her mother, a special-education tutor, and her stepfather, a litigator (both now retired). Her father, a management consultant, died when she was 18. Ms. Mack attended the private school Nightingale-Bamford.

After double-majoring in art and art history at Franklin & Marshall College, she moved back to the old neighborhood. She lived in a tiny studio apartment, working as an assistant photo editor for George, John F. Kennedy Jr.’s magazine, then as a fashion assistant to Narciso Rodriguez, who designed Carolyn Bessette Kennedy’s wedding gown.

A blind date with an older, divorced man named Mark Madoff led to a second date, then a third. In 2004, in a Narciso dress of her own, she married him on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. They lived in an apartment in SoHo, a house in Greenwich, Conn., and in another on Nantucket. They added one child to Mark’s two from his previous marriage, and Stephanie was pregnant with another.

“We had a really, really nice life,” Ms. Mack said. “We had means to have beautiful homes, and do what we want when we wanted.”

Photo

In December 2008, the fairy tale took a dark and lurching twist when Bernie Madoff confessed to his sons, Mark and Andrew, that he had spent the better part of his career in finance carrying out a massive Ponzi scheme. His sons, who had worked for their father’s firm for their entire careers, turned him in to authorities, who soon arrested Mr. Madoff.

The fraud devastated families, hedge funds and nonprofits from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Europe and beyond.

Ms. Mack’s mother and stepfather had investments with Mr. Madoff, as did many of her and Mark’s close friends.

In March 2009, Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts, including theft, fraud and money laundering. Mark, Andrew and Ruth, their mother, said they knew nothing of the scheme. Ms. Mack believed them. Others weren’t so sure, including the bankruptcy trustee. But they were never charged, and in June 2009 Mr. Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

Overnight, Ms. Mack had entered a circus of lawyers, F.B.I. agents, paparazzi and tabloid headlines.

After considering changing her last name to Morgan she decided on Mack, after ACK, the airport code for Nantucket. “I just didn’t want to hear it anymore,” she said, adding that Mark planned to change his name once his lawyers gave the O.K.

But with constant news coverage of the scandal and multiple civil suits, Mark seemed to be spiraling emotionally. In October 2009, he attempted suicide, swallowing pills and landing in a psychiatric ward. Over the next year, he worked on a new business, a real-estate newsletter.

Things seemed to be looking up, Ms. Mack said, but then Mark attempted suicide once again, this time successfully, with his 2-year-old son sleeping in an adjacent bedroom. Ms. Mack was in Walt Disney World with her 4-year old daughter, and awoke to two emails from Mark, one asking her to send someone to care for their son, the other blank, with the subject line: “I love you.”

Photo

Her stepfather rushed to the couple’s SoHo apartment, where he found Mark’s body.

Ms. Mack said the months after were a blur of heartbreak, anger, financial uncertainty and shame. “I am somebody who cannot stand waiters singing ‘Happy Birthday’ to me in a restaurant. Can you imagine your life being plastered everywhere?” she said. “And then, your husband taking his own life two years later is shameful. It’s just shameful.”

Mark’s suicide, many surmised, was an indication of his guilt.

“I was like, ‘No way. He’s not going down like this. I’m telling the truth,’” Ms. Mack said. In 2011 she published “The End of Normal,” a memoir in which she wrote at length about her steadfast belief that Mark was clueless about his father’s fraud.

She finished a graduate school program at Bank Street College of Education, hoping to work with pediatric patients and their families in hospitals, but found it too much to manage with her two young children.

“That word is a very difficult word to say. To be a widow? You just think of that old lady,” Ms. Mack said. “It just sounds old and depressing and sad to me. Look, I’m not old-old. I’m not 25, but I’m not old. And I’m not depressing.”

She got the idea to become a stylist over dinner with a friend, after starting to date again, tentatively, in 2012 and realizing that a good outfit was a kind of protection. “Somebody gets set up on a date with me, they can find out everything about me,” Ms. Mack said. “Literally everything. To become less nervous, I needed to feel like I looked good.”

She contacted several high-end matchmakers and soon found herself working with people who were also seeking romantic relationships in less than ideal circumstances.

“I learned very quickly that everyone has a story, and a bad story,” Ms. Mack said. “The only difference between me and whomever is that mine was public. It’s loss. It’s the same emotion.”

‘A Working Mom’

Her client base soon expanded beyond the dating world. A cookbook author who needed help putting together an ensemble for a book party. A woman on a very tight budget celebrating her appearance in an Oscar-nominated documentary.

Tara Roscioli, a nutritionist, author and entrepreneur, made an appointment to meet Ms. Mack not long ago at Otte, a store on North Moore Street in TriBeCa. The two women arrived early and went through the racks together before heading toward the rear of the store.

“I knew she was a single mom. And I knew that she was an author. I didn’t know anything else,” Ms. Roscioli said. “She’s very real and down-to-earth, and her style and clothes are the same way. She’s a working mom. She gives off a very ‘real woman’ vibe that resonated with me.”

When Ms. Roscioli emerged from the fitting room in a long black dress (Ulla Johnson, $750), Ms. Mack suggested adding a leather jacket (Iro, $1,200).

“Do you feel comfortable in it? Does it feel special enough? Do you feel amazing?,” she asked, making notes. “The biggest mistake is putting on something you don’t feel comfortable in.”

The expedition ended with no sale but a hug and promise of another meeting.

Veronica Miele Beard, a designer and the co-founder of the fashion line Veronica Beard, has known Ms. Mack since they attended Franklin & Marshall.

“Shoppers now want an emotional attachment to clothing,” Ms. Beard said. “They want to feel an emotional reason for buying a piece. Stephanie brings that out. She cares about how clothing makes her clients feel.”

Photo

What about how Ms. Mack feels?

Mark’s brother, Andrew, died in 2014 of lymphoma. Bernie’s brother, Peter, is serving a federal prison sentence. Bernie is scheduled for release in 2139. And Ruth has settled into a quiet life in Old Greenwich, Conn.

The surviving unincarcerated members of the Madoff family spent years split into factions, often not speaking with one another. But that has changed, Ms. Mack said, adding that she is now in regular contact with Ruth and that relations have improved with Mark’s ex-wife. (Both women confirmed this.)

“She is so much fun to be around, and I wish the public could see that side of her,” Ms. Mack said of Ruth. “I’ve urged her to have a comeback. Everyone loves a comeback.”

As for Bernie?

“He’s dead to me.”

This summer, Ms. Mack’s lawyers hammered out a settlement with the bankruptcy trustee, Irving Picard, who was sorting out the financial mess left in the wake of the Ponzi scheme, and she handed over what she says was the majority of her fortune.

By 2016, the apartment in SoHo was sold, as was the house on Nantucket and the house in Greenwich. After Mark’s suicide, Ms. Mack had moved from SoHo to TriBeCa, but she could no longer afford it, she said, and so she crossed the bridge into Brooklyn.

Yet, she knows what the public likely still thinks about her — that, as a Madoff, she was “dripping in diamonds.” That she still is.

“That was never me,” Ms. Mack said. “Even when I was a wealthy Madoff. I didn’t marry Mark Madoff, get a credit card and drop $30,000 in any store I wanted.”

Photo

“I didn’t just frivolously go out and spend just tons and tons of money,” she said.

Marybeth Gibson, a friend and real-estate agent on Nantucket, said in a phone interview: “Stephanie would rather stay home and cook a roast chicken than she would get all dressed up and go out.”

Ms. Mack wonders, sometimes, what Mark must have been thinking when he made the decision to commit suicide, to abandon her. She thinks Mark didn’t see a life where he wouldn’t be swarmed by photographers. He simply couldn’t imagine a bright future. He thought he “was toast.”

Initially, Ms. Mack changed her last name out of the same fear — that the Madoff name might forever brand her a pariah. She now knows what she is convinced Mark could not bring himself to see, that infamy can be as fleeting as fame.

The scandal that once rocked New York has moved off the front pages of the tabloids. The paparazzi have moved on, circling the apartment buildings of other people. And Ms. Mack has resumed using her married name in her personal life and on her FreshDirect boxes.

As her clients try on jeans and dresses and beanies, and they share the trauma of their own loss, Ms. Mack tries to convince them of the same thing she wanted Mark to believe: It won’t always be quite this hard, this raw.

“I’m like, ‘You know what? It’s not going to get better by Friday. It’s not going to get better in two weeks. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take a lot of time,’” she said. “I’m actual living proof.”

“I don’t have what I used to have, but I have more than a lot of the rest of the planet,” she said. “And I’m grateful for that.”

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

‘We’re Offended Every Day’

On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah said he was not shocked that President Trump had offended the widow of a fallen soldier during a phone conversation this week. Mr. Trump had told the wife of Sgt. La David T. Johnson that her husband “knew what he signed up for” when he joined the military, according to Mr. Johnson’s mother.

“I don’t think we should be surprised that Trump offended this family. We’ve all heard him speak: We’re offended every day. What do you think, a phone is going to magically transform him into Sir Phineas the Eloquent? Like, Trump’s going to be talking, like, ‘All these losers and haters! Bing bing, bong bong — bigly! Hold on, I gotta make a call. Greetings and salutations. My soul is awash in a great flood of sorrow as I reflect upon your circumstance. Where was I? Little Rocket Man!’ It’s not going to happen.” — TREVOR NOAH

Mr. Noah also criticized Mr. Trump for going out of his way to claim that President Obama often failed to contact the families of fallen soldiers, an unsubstantiated assertion that added a layer of controversy.

“How do you start with something so clear and then suddenly veer off track? It’s like Trump was handed the baton in a race, and instead of staying in his lane he walks off the track, gets into a car, drives the car off a cliff, rolls down the cliff, the car explodes, he gets out of the car, dusts himself off, and he’s like, ‘Why didn’t Obama drive?’” — TREVOR NOAH

BET’s ‘The Rundown’ Reimagines ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — The Emmy-award winning actor John Lithgow does not have a favorite word, he says, because he loves too many of them to narrow the choice down to a single one. When pressed, he comes up with “eldritch,” an intriguing word that means sinister and eerie, and which seems to have made a kind of comeback in the 20th century. It is exactly the type of word that a logophile like Mr. Lithgow might like, and he savors it as it leaves his lips.

Mr. Lithgow himself is anything but eldritch, despite his dazzling and dark portrayal of the serial killer Arthur Mitchell on the Showtime series “Dexter,” for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

As part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword, our editor Will Shortz is running a series of crossword collaborations between people of note and popular Times constructors, and today it is Mr. Lithgow’s turn to make a different kind of debut. Rather than walk onto the stage of a theater, step onto a television or film set, or put pen to paper to write one of his books for children, Mr. Lithgow scaled a very steep learning curve with Mr. Quigley, and the result is an entertaining puzzle that definitely has his signature on it.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

For a Friday, this is pretty straightforward and, if you have been itching to try a themeless puzzle, this might be a good one to try if you are not quite used to the wordplay of late week clues.

Indeed after the game, Cubs Manager Joe Maddon acknowledged how hard it had been for his team to get going this season after winning the World Series a year ago, the team’s first title in 108 years. “That’s what the World Series hangover is,” he said.

In contrast, the Dodgers, who won 104 games in the regular season, the most in baseball, have looked energized since the postseason began, and have lost only once so far — a 3-2 defeat in Game 4 on Wednesday that kept the Cubs’ faint hopes alive for one more day.

Appropriately enough, the winning pitcher on Thursday night was Clayton Kershaw, the three-time Cy Young Award winner. He was on the mound a year ago when the Cubs hit him around and clinched the N.L.C.S. But on Thursday night, Kershaw allowed only one run over six stout innings to finally earn a pennant to put on his résumé.

And outfielder Enrique Hernandez, who epitomizes the Dodgers’ roster of versatile players, supplied nearly all the offense himself by smashing a solo home run, a two-run shot and a grand slam to tie a postseason single-game record of seven R.B.I.

“It’s been a long time,” a jubilant Kershaw, who became a Dodger in 2008, said afterward. “It’s not erased yet. We have to win four more games, but ever since I came to the organization it’s been ‘1988, 1988.’ It’s the year I was born, so I know all this stuff. We want to make it ‘2017.’ ”

Entering this season, the Dodgers had made 10 playoff appearances since their last World Series run in 1988, when they beat Oakland in five games, but not once could they reach the final round. No other team in baseball has played in the postseason that many consecutive times without at least one trip to the Series.

In that frustrating span, the Dodgers reached the N.L.C.S. four times — 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2016 — but stumbled each year. They have also won five straight N.L. West division titles, including this year, but were bounced from the postseason earlier than they hoped each time — until now.

At the start of this decade the Dodgers went through franchise turbulence, and eventually Frank McCourt was replaced as owner of the team by Guggenheim Baseball Management, a group led by the billionaire Mark Walter.

The Dodgers began to spend, a lot. Since the start of the 2014 season, it has been they, not the Yankees, who have had the highest payroll in baseball. But the Dodgers also hired Andrew Friedman, then the general manager of the small-market and small-budget Tampa Bay Rays, to head the baseball operations.

“This ownership came in and did what they said, gave us the tools and gave us the personnel and gave us anything and everything we needed to win, and it was up to us players to achieve that,” said outfielder Andre Ethier, the longest tenured Dodger, who has been in the organization since 2006.

And while they spent $192 million over the off-season to keep three of their best players — third baseman Justin Turner, starter Rich Hill, and closer Kenley Jansen — they also filled the roster with both cheaper relievers, such as Josh Fields and Brandon Morrow, and talented young players like shortstop Corey Seager, who was the N.L. Rookie of the Year last year but did not play in this series because of a back injury, and first baseman Cody Bellinger, who may win the award this year.

The last time the Dodgers reached the World Series they were led by Manager Tommy Lasorda, pitcher Orel Hershiser and outfielder Kirk Gibson. Lasorda is now 90 and he ambled on to the field at Wrigley Field before Thursday’s game to watch the current crop of Dodgers take batting practice.

And then he went and sat in the stands and looked on as the current Dodgers put Game 5 away quickly.

“Wouldn’t it be great to play the Yankees?” Lasorda said after the game. “It puts the entire nation, from here to here, all into the baseball view. That’s going to be, if they win it, a great series.”

Bellinger’s run-scoring double started the scoring in the first inning. Hernandez saw two pitches combined in his first two at-bats against Cubs starter Jose Quintana, swung twice, and produced two home runs.

After the third-inning grand slam, Hernandez threw a fist into the air as he rounded first base. The Dodgers dugout bounced with glee, and welcomed Hernandez with vigorous high-fives and hugs. Cubs fans could only grimace. They had rejoiced last fall when the Cubs finally ended their epic title drought and probably knew, considering the Cubs’ tortured history, that two titles in a row was far-fetched. Still, watching their team get eliminated at Wrigley Field had to sting, although many of them stuck around as the one-sided game dragged on.

Meanwhile, Hernandez just kept going. In the ninth inning, he added his third and final home run, joining players such as Albert Pujols and Reggie Jackson, who have hit three home runs in a postseason game. And after the inning was over, the Dodgers celebrated more forcefully, finally earning a World Series berth after so many failed attempts.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one. The members of an upstanding, upper-middle-class nuclear family are terrorized by a malign force. Their suffering is not entirely arbitrary, because not all of them are completely innocent. (Usually it’s Daddy’s fault.) Their tormentor metes out a cruel and disproportionate kind of justice, and revels in the punishment. Meanwhile, the audience squirms in complicity, taking both masochistic and sadistic pleasure at a game of cat and mouse in which the roles keep shifting.

I’ll stop now. It isn’t quite fair to say, with respect to Yorgos Lanthimos’s “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” that you’ve seen it all before. His methods and sensibility are very much his own. But if you were intrigued, unnerved and tickled by “The Lobster” or by Mr. Lanthimos’s earlier films “Alps” and “Dogtooth” (I was), you might be surprised and a little disappointed to find him traipsing over such familiar territory. His previous work — allegorical, satirical, anti-realist and metapsychological — defies genre labels and can seem scrubbed clean of any trace of influence. “Sacred Deer,” in contrast, rings all kinds of frequently-heard bells.

Video

The premise might remind you of any version of “Cape Fear” (except maybe the one from “The Simpsons”) or countless horror movies. Mr. Lanthimos’s techniques — a hovering, prying camera, an atmosphere of chilly, cerebral detachment — owe a debt to the films of Michael Haneke, in particular those like “Cache” and “Funny Games” that subject the guilty conscience of the bourgeoisie to painful deep-tissue massage. But Mr. Lanthimos is less interested in moral shock therapy or social criticism than in aesthetic estrangement. “Sacred Deer” feels like a dark, opaque bit of folklore transplanted into an off-kilter modern setting.

Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a respected heart surgeon. His wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman), is an equally successful eye doctor. They live with their two children — Kim (Raffey Cassidy), a wide-eyed teenage girl, and her younger brother, Bob (Sunny Suljic) — in a big house in an unspecified, apparently American city. (The film was shot in Ireland and Cincinnati.) Steven also has a curious friendship with an odd, earnest young man named Martin (Barry Keoghan). The two of them have lunch and take walks together and exchange gifts, and the opening scenes invite the audience to guess at the nature of their relationship.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It’s made clear soon enough. Martin, who seems both a little slow and spookily intuitive, turns out to be the evil force who will torment the Murphys. Some years earlier, Steven had performed an operation on the boy’s father, who subsequently died. In lieu of filing a malpractice claim, Martin has chosen a more archaic — and, in the film’s modern setting, a far scarier and more preposterous — form of score settling. He demands that Steven kill Anna or one of their kids. If he doesn’t, the whole family will sicken and die. Martin describes the process in exacting detail, and then it begins.

Is this a curse? A superpower? As in Mr. Lanthimos’s other movies, no explanation is offered. No boundary is marked between the normal and the supernatural. The normal, in this filmmaker’s world, is pretty weird to begin with. All the characters speak in the same droning, matter-of-fact tone until they are provoked to violent rage. They ask puzzling questions and produce overelaborate answers, not so much like machines but like people doing their best to fail a Turing test.

Sometimes this is funny, and sometimes effectively scary. The auditory migraine of the sound design and the visual paranoia of the drone-mounted cameras help create an ambience of perpetual panic. You laugh to break the tension, and also you can’t help but intuit a comic intention under the cast’s deadpan. Mr. Farrell, half-hidden behind an absurdly self-important salt-and-pepper beard, extinguishes nearly all of his natural impishness but keeps the tiniest ember burning. Ms. Kidman has a gift for seeming utterly natural in the most artificial of settings, and here, as in “The Beguiled” and “Dogville,” she brings fresh air to the hothouse of a director’s imagination.

“An older woman lived in the house,” Ms. Driscoll said. “She flushes the toilet only so many times a day. But a family of four? We were definitely going to create a problem with this sewer pipe.”

Their request for a credit to cover the work was denied, so they moved on and wound up buying a smaller house in the same neighborhood, but one where they didn’t have to worry about finding sewage in the basement.

Underground problems, bowed foundations, litigious homeowner associations and flips that are actually flops: A lot of things could put the brakes on a home purchase, and they might not be the things you notice while you’re at the open house. Here are three categories of red flags to keep in mind while you’re looking for that perfect house.

STRUCTURAL OR UNDERGROUND ISSUES

Finding an inspector who will be thorough is crucial once you’ve made an offer on a home. And just as you would ask around for recommendations for a broker, get advice on inspectors, too. A great home inspector will point out every single little thing wrong with a property; one that isn’t as good could miss a flaw that leads to big repair bills down the line.

When reviewing an inspection report, keep in mind that while a faulty outlet or a leaky faucet may be a nuisance – as can be negotiations with a seller over who will cover the repair – they’re often not enough to kill a deal. It’s those things that can’t really be fixed, or can be fixed only for a hefty price, that should have buyers reconsidering their dream homes.

“The biggest issue would be structural failure,” said Frank Lesh, executive director of the American Society of Home Inspectors. While one small crack in a wall may not be a big deal, a crack with a bulge around it, one that runs horizontally the length of the house or one with a deflection, which “means one part of the wall is going one way and the other part is going the other way,” Mr. Lesh said, are likely signs of major foundation issues.

Water intrusion is another red flag because of how destructive water can be, he added. Sometimes there is an easy fix: If gutters are clogged, clean them out; if downspouts are emptying at the foundation, reorient them.

“But if you live next to a river or creek that always overflows — well, you know that’s going to be a long-term problem,” Mr. Lesh said. “It’s just a matter of when.”

In 2011, water stopped a home purchase for Marcia Layton Turner, now 52, and her family on a house in Pittsford, N.Y. The house was the right size and had extras that made it appealing, like a barn that Ms. Turner, a writer, pictured using as a home office. But she and her husband were concerned that they could smell mildew in a basement guest room. They also spotted a dehumidifier running in another part of the basement.

The home inspector raised a flag about water issues too. He noted that one of the basement walls was cold and damp, which he said was a sign of drainage problems. The inspector recommended adding a French drain system, which would take water away from the house, so they lowered their offer to factor in the cost. Before they could negotiate with the seller, another buyer came in with a better offer. The couple eventually bought another home in the same town.

A few years later, Ms. Turner’s husband, who runs a hearth-products store, was back in the home they nearly bought to give an estimate on converting a wood stove into a gas stove. The homeowner told him that they had spent about $40,000 on repairs, including installing a French drain. “He said something to the effect of ‘Be glad you didn’t buy it,’” Ms. Turner said.

Other structural or underground items Mr. Lesh said to look out for in the inspection report: lead paint and asbestos. If the inspection does not include sending a camera down drainage and sewer lines, he recommended paying extra for it, especially if the home is older or near trees whose roots could be damaging pipes.

Another potential issue: unremediated oil tanks, which Lesh said are a big issue on the East Coast, because so many homes there use oil for heat. Removing oil tanks and cleaning up a spill can be expensive and complicated if a state environmental agency gets involved.

DOCUMENTS

Most document-related issues tend to be flagged by brokers, the lender, an insurance company or a lawyer, if you use one. The title report is one place where a lot of problems are found, said Gemma M. Giantomasi, a lawyer in the real estate, development and land use group at Chiesa Shahinian & Giantomasi. A title search can reveal things like judgments against the property that would stick to the property rather than the seller; an undisclosed fire; or even that the home is not owned by the person selling it.

For homes in areas that are near water or have flooded in the past, buyers will also need a certificate that states that the house is at the proper elevation. If you’re shopping for a house in a beach town, it might also make sense to avoid the only house on the block that has not been elevated.

“You’re going to need to know if you’re going to have to raise the house or pay exorbitant flood insurance,” said Heather K. Colella, a broker who works in areas that were affected by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. She recommended not just looking at flood maps, but going to the municipality and asking for the elevation requirement.

The seller’s disclosure is another place to look for problems. But be wary of disclosures filled out by someone who hasn’t lived in the home for some time — or ever — which could be the case when a child is selling the home of a deceased parent, said Elizabeth Mendenhall, president-elect of the National Association of Realtors: “If the seller has never lived in a home, you may not have an accurate picture of what has actually happened in that home.”

For a home that has traded hands frequently in a short period of time, she suggested looking at how much it sold for each time. If each sale was at a significantly higher dollar figure, the turnover could be a sign that the property is in a hot neighborhood, not that something is wrong with it.

For a house that has been flipped, Ms. Mendenhall advised buyers to demand proof that all contractors who have worked on the house have been paid. Otherwise, contractors could put a lien on the home – which would affect the new owner, not the flipper who stiffed them.

But flips aren’t always a red flag, Ms. Mendenhall noted: “It’s not necessarily a bad thing. In many instances, somebody has taken the time and care and made an old home livable to a new family.” The quality of construction, however, should be scrutinized.

In 2012, Nikki Carpenter, 32, a research foundation grant manager, fell in love with a 100-year-old home in Scotch Plains, N.J., that had been abandoned for several years before being bought by an investor and renovated. Not only was it in a town that she and her husband, Joshua Pellittieri, loved, it was also big enough for their expanding family: She was seven months pregnant with their second child when they made the offer. And it looked beautiful.

Their inspector, however, saw through that. The inspection report came back with a list of big problems, including standing water in the basement; a deck not built to code; a connector from the outside water main to the inside plumbing that had been installed backward; and hookups for a washer and dryer, but no drain for the washer or vent for the dryer. The inspector also found evidence of improperly removed asbestos.

The sellers “claimed they had no idea there were so many things wrong with it,” Ms. Carpenter said. She and her husband didn’t try negotiating a lower price, or ask the sellers to make repairs. “We didn’t really trust them at that point, and didn’t trust them to do anything further,” she said. They stayed in their apartment, which they rented month to month, and eventually bought a different house in Scotch Plains.

NEIGHBORS

You can’t always pick your neighbors if they move in after you do, but you can get an idea of who is already there before you move in.

When considering a property that is part of a homeowners’ association or co-op, buyers will want a record of the association’s maintenance costs and any increases in fees to unit owners, said Moses Seuram, treasurer of the New York State Association of Realtors.

“Ask them how long ago major improvements were done, how it was paid for, and was it through special assessment or reserves,” he said. If the association has been putting off maintenance or doing big-ticket repairs like a roof replacement or HVAC upgrade, buyers could be on the hook for a lot of additional costs very quickly.

Also be wary of any board or association that has often been sued or that does a lot of suing, warned Ms. Giantomasi, the real estate lawyer. Lenders will often balk at financing such purchases — and maybe these are not the kind of people you want for neighbors, either.

If the home is not in an association or co-op, look as closely as you can at neighboring properties and how well they are maintained. Hang out on the block at different times of day to get a feel for what it’s like after school lets out, at night and during morning rush hour.

And if you’re looking at homes in the winter, try to find pictures of the block in the summer, which could tell you if the neighbors keep their outdoor spaces tidy. (Google Street View is a good place to start.) Neighbors who don’t maintain their homes can be an even bigger problem if property like a driveway is shared and negotiations over shared repairs are necessary.

If the inspection report reveals issues caused by a neighbor’s property — like a crack in that shared driveway or water from the neighbor’s land draining into the home that is for sale — buyers or their brokers should see how open the neighbors are to making the repair before the sale goes through.

That could sink a deal for the seller. But it could also save the buyer a world of headaches if the property – and the problem – eventually becomes their own.

We only think we know the people who wind up, intentionally or not, in the spotlight. We categorize them. Trivialize them.

It will be published on Tuesday.

“What we wanted to write about in the book was the nuance of people that we love,” Barbara said, and they’ve done just that, charting the distance between public image and private reality. The stories that they tell are often self-serving, and they skim over the failures and wages of their father’s presidency. But they do make you question the caricatures that we blithely traffic in, the assumptions that we breezily make and our reluctance to allow for how much the objects of our curiosity can change.

Their father’s late-blooming obsession with painting: Even they didn’t see that one coming. He skipped the trips to art museums that their mother, Laura, took them on when they were kids.

But after his presidency ended in 2009, he got an iPhone, Barbara said, and “discovered this little drawing app and would do little sketches and send them to us.”

Jenna added: “We would say, ‘Hey, Dad, Happy Sunday, what are you up to?’ And he would stick-figure a little airplane.”

“With his little face waving out of it,” Barbara chimed in. That meant that he was flying somewhere.

The book is stippled with insider anecdotes, my favorite of which recounts a meal that Barbara and her mother shared with Silvio Berlusconi in 2006, when he was Italy’s prime minister and Barbara was 24. (She and Jenna are now 35.) Berlusconi complimented her on her blue eyes, told her that she should mate with his son and, for good measure, announced: “If I was younger, I’d have children with you.” Barbara’s loss, obviously, but she has somehow soldiered on.

I told her that when I read that part, I immediately thought of Trump, and of his various comments over the years about the hotness — in Daddy’s eyes — of Ivanka. She didn’t take the bait.

They’re careful, she and Jenna. They have made clear over the years that they’re not perfect political overlaps with the rest of their family, which is the Republican Party’s great modern dynasty. Barbara, for example, appeared in a video endorsing same-sex marriage back in 2011.

But that’s not the kind of attention they usually court, and during our hours together at Café Altro Paradiso, where Jenna had ricotta dumplings and Barbara swordfish, they repeatedly registered their disgust with the divisiveness of our national conversation. They don’t want to add to the ugliness, which pains Jenna all the more, she said, because she has two daughters, Mila, 4, and Poppy, 2.

“This moment, as a mother, feels a little frightening, because I’m nervous to have the TV on to hear some of the rhetoric that is coming from the highest position,” Jenna said, conspicuously not uttering the syllable “Trump” itself. “The way I speak about elections and the way I speak about everything has changed, because I’m now a role model to two little humans who I want to teach about love and empathy and compassion.”

She and Barbara, who is single, woke up together in Jenna’s bed on the morning after election night, because Jenna’s husband, Henry Hager, was away, and Barbara had come over to watch the returns, which were still being counted into the wee hours. Jenna wouldn’t say if those results disappointed her, but she and Barbara both expressed a fierce wish to see a female president soon.

“One hundred percent,” Jenna said, and again mentioned her girls. “Mila, the other day in the car, goes, ‘Mommy, Poppy rules the world,’ about her baby sister. And I go: ‘Well, Poppy could rule the world. Maybe one day she could be president.’ And Mila goes, ‘But, Mom, presidents are men.’ She said that.”

From mid-1999 to late-2001 I covered their father’s campaign and the start of his presidency, and I remember seeing them on the fringes of events. I also remember the media’s sometimes cheap fascination with them when they went off to college — Jenna to the University of Texas, Barbara to Yale — and were repeatedly caught consuming alcohol before they were legally old enough to.

“Jenna and Tonic” was a headline in The New York Post. People magazine went with “Double Trouble,” while Newsweek opted for “Busted Again in Margaritaville.” They were embarrassed, yes, but also frustrated by what they insist were exaggerations in many accounts.

Back then I was never formally introduced to either of them. But perhaps five years ago, Barbara visited me at The Times to discuss the Global Health Corps, a public-health analogue to the Peace Corps and Teach for America that sends more than 100 recent college graduates annually into the most impoverished areas of the world. She founded it, raised money for it, is its chief executive and spends plenty of time in those places herself.

Partly because of her focus on health but largely to stir up trouble, I asked her and Jenna, whom I was meeting for the first time, about Trump’s move to make it easier for employers to deny coverage of birth control. He’d announced that just hours before our lunch.

“It does feel like we’re going backwards in some ways,” Jenna said, “and that’s probably as much as I can say.”

Is she pro-choice?

“I can’t say,” she answered. “I’d be in trouble at work.”

Barbara?

“I am very for women having everything they need to live healthy, dignified lives,” she told me.

“Is that a yes?” I asked.

“I think women should be able to make the right decision that would allow them to live — truly allow them to live,” she said.

Jenna shook her head: “He might have wanted a yes or no.” Indeed he might have.

Their father opposed abortion rights but their mother stayed mum, vaguely identifying herself as pro-choice only after the couple left the White House. That approximated the trajectory of her mother-in-law, the former first lady Barbara Bush, who pops up frequently in “Sisters First” and, like the rest of the clan, isn’t exactly who you expect.

Regal? Entitled? Not according to the account of the twins’ visit to the White House shortly after the first President Bush’s election, when they were 7. They discovered the bowling lane in the basement and, using the phone there, asked a staffer to bring them peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

“We were like Eloise in our Plaza!” Jenna writes. “When the door opened, it was not our sandwiches, but our Ganny, who appeared and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not in a hotel, but temporary guests in a historic home, and we were never to do that again.”

Laura Bush is “quiet and bookish,” Barbara writes, but then again not: “Beneath her flats and cardigans, my mom is in fact our closet hippie and Rastafarian.” She dragged Barbara, then a teenager, to a reggae concert in Austin, Tex.

Barbara also writes that while her father can be “loud and unthoughtful,” he “outreads us all.” After Barbara went through her first devastating romantic breakup a few years ago, he called or texted her daily, “just to check in, just to share the burden with me.”

The twins portray him as surprisingly self-effacing.

During his presidency, they spotted an anti-Bush bumper sticker with a withering put-down, and they not only told him about it but turned it into a running family joke. “Now,” Barbara writes, “this line comes up regularly when we want to rib our former-leader-of-the-free-world father: ‘Well, somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot.’ ”

After Jenna, covering the Golden Globes for NBC, conflated two movies about African-Americans by referring to “Hidden Fences,” he quickly texted her to remind her that where verbal pratfalls were concerned, he’d been there, done that and survived. She would, too.

Jenna and Barbara told me that for as long as they can remember, he has brought their mother coffee in bed every morning, including when he was in the White House, because he’s always up first. He brings them coffee in bed when they visit.

They seemed to me a long, long way from Margaritaville. They’re not the Manhattan party fixtures they could easily be. They show considerable restraint. They also show generosity.

Back in January, as Malia and Sasha Obama prepared to move out of the White House, Jenna and Barbara wrote them a letter that acknowledged the challenges that they’d already faced and that they would continue to confront, including “harsh criticism of your parents by people who had never even met them.”

“Your precious parents,” the Bush twins wrote, “were reduced to headlines.”

So were their parents. Their grandparents. Their low-energy uncle, Jeb. It goes with the territory. But it’s also part of what makes that ground so forbidding, and scares many good people away.

The Libre I buy from Italy has a self-adhesive, waterproof white sensor that sticks to my arm for 14 days. It took some trial and error to get used to it. One sensor flipped off from over-aggressive toweling at the gym; another came loose after a backpack strap nicked it. Finally, rather than the spot on my outer arm that the manufacturer recommends, I tried putting the sensor on the inside of my arm, which is where it rests right now. It’s barely noticeable, although occasionally a small child will demand to know what it is.

I can see real-time results on a small digital reader (or an Android phone app): an arrow going up, down or level alongside my blood glucose number. The resulting data set — averages, trends and patterns — monitors my glucose status 24/7.

At first, scanning the Libre to check my results after breakfast, lunch or dinner was like bingeing on my favorite Netflix show. I’d show the readout, a blue line with peaks and valleys, to friends and family: Look how I stayed in the normal range all day!

Or the flip side: Look what happened after an intense workout. Even without food in my stomach, my blood sugar often, but not always, rose during exercise, which made planning tricky. The device gives me a window to the impact of cortisol, a stress hormone, which prompts a rush of glucose into my bloodstream.

After a year and a half of paying well over $2,000 out of pocket — six sensors every three months along with shipping fees — my condition has improved. My hemoglobin A1C now clocks in around 6.3 to 6.5, down from 7.0, and my doctor is thrilled. (An A1C level of 5.7 percent is considered normal in people without diabetes.)

Jeffrey Brewer, the chief executive of Bigfoot Biomedical, got his hands on a Libre early (on eBay) and plans to use it as a component of the artificial pancreas his company is working to develop. Mr. Brewer, who has a son with Type 1 diabetes and is a former president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, said it’s the first glucose monitor “that people really love.”

Dr. David Lam, associate director of the Mount Sinai Diabetes Center in New York, currently prescribes a Dexcom CGM, a device similar to the Libre but which requires calibrating with a finger stick twice a day, to his patients with Type 1 diabetes. (Insurance companies typically cover the cost of these devices for people with Type 1 but not Type 2 diabetes) Dr. Lam sees potential benefits in using the Libre or similar devices for anyone with diabetes. “It’s not only a diagnostic tool, it’s an educational tool. You learn how foods affect your body, you can see trends, and you can predict lows and highs,” he said.

Dr. Pratik Choudhary, a senior lecturer and consultant at the diabetes center at King’s College London who previewed the Libre early on, said there are limits to its usefulness. “It is just not cost effective at current prices,” he said. Dozens of studies have shown that continuous glucose monitoring leads to lower hemoglobin A1C results but for someone with tight control (like me), a half point percent change in A1C is a “minimal improvement to quality of life.”

Still, how do we quantify peace of mind?

The treasure trove of data I get from the Libre — days, weeks and months of data — has made it easier for me to manage my life. Learning that it would be available by prescription at major pharmacies in the States late this year seemed like great news.

But the model sold here will have a 10-day sensor, rather than the 14-day sensors used worldwide, along with an extended warm-up time — 12 hours for the F.D.A.-approved version versus one hour for my Italian model. That seems like a step backward. I also don’t know how expensive it will be, or whether my insurance under the increasingly shaky Affordable Care Act will cover it. Until those questions are answered, I may stick with my Milan-to-Manhattan route.

In 1994, when the agreement went into effect, many people hoped that it would jump-start rapid growth in the Mexican economy; it didn’t. Some proponents also argued that the United States would run large surpluses in its trade with Mexico; in fact, after its 1995 financial crisis Mexico began running surpluses instead.

Furthermore, growing trade definitely hurt some U.S. workers. Some U.S. companies laid off workers and moved production to Mexico (although others added jobs to produce goods for Mexican markets, or gained a competitive advantage from the ability to purchase components from Mexican suppliers).

By any measure, the costs inflicted by Nafta were far smaller than those created by imports from China — and these in turn were far smaller than those created by changing technology. For example, the decline in coal-mining employment — caused almost entirely by technological change — or the collapse in truckers’ wages — reflecting deregulation and the collapse of union power — had nothing to do with Nafta. Still, the trade deal caused some real pain.

But admitting this unpleasant reality has almost no bearing on the question of what to do now. Nafta’s disruptions are mostly in the rearview mirror.

We now live in a North American economy built around the reality of free trade. In particular, U.S., Canadian and Mexican manufacturing are deeply enmeshed with one another. Many industrial plants were built precisely to take advantage of our economic integration, buying from or selling to other industrial plants across the borders.

As a result, breaking up or degrading Nafta would have the same disruptive effects that came from Nafta’s creation: Plants would close, jobs would disappear, communities would lose their livelihoods. And, yes, many businesses, small, large and in some cases huge, would lose many billions of dollars.

Oh, and it’s not just manufacturing. What do you think would happen to the farmers of Iowa if they lost one of the most important markets for their corn?

So what I and others have been assuming is that these realities would stay Trump’s hand. No matter how ignorant he may be about the realities of North American trade, we assumed that he would in the end balk at alienating big businesses and big money.

But now I’m not so sure.

For one thing, Nafta negotiations are going very badly. America’s demands — requiring renewal every five years, taking away the ability of businesses to appeal government actions — would undermine the predictability, the assurance of future market access, that was the trade agreement’s main point.

Meanwhile, documents leaked to The Washington Post show key administration advisers attributing virtually every social ill, from spousal abuse to divorce, to the loss of manufacturing jobs — and we know that the administration, wrongly, believes that trade treaties are the cause of those job losses.

Most important, look at what Trump has been doing with his open, indeed gleeful sabotage of the U.S. health care system. Never mind the huge human costs he’s imposing; he isn’t even following any plausible political strategy, since he and his party are likely, with good reason, to be blamed for the damage. Furthermore, his actions will cost big businesses — insurers and health providers — billions; he’s even boasting about how much he has hurt their stock prices.

So we’ve now seen Trump deliberately hurt millions of people and inflict billions of losses on a major industry out of sheer spite. If he’s willing to do that on health care, why assume he won’t do the same thing on international trade policy?

Nafta, then, is at real risk. And if it does get destroyed, the only question is whether the consequences will be ugly, or extremely ugly.

At American Ballet Theater Gala, All Is the Same but Different

Another shift at Ballet Theater has been the absence of foreign guest stars. (The non-Americans onstage Wednesday appear with the company all year round.) This policy may well prove controversial among Ballet Theater loyalists, many of whom care far more to see visiting luminaries than evidence of any ensemble style. Just now, doubts — only subtle, nothing intense, but central to the company’s identity — attach chiefly to Mr. Ratmansky. The poetic visions of his dances lack the spectacular impact those old-school loyalists crave.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The evening’s two premieres were Ms. Lang’s “The Gift” and Mr. Ratmansky’s “Songs of Bukovina”; the evening ended with Christopher Wheeldon’s “Thirteen Diversions” (2011). “The Gift” and “Thirteen Diversions” both seem perfect fare for a Ballet Theater gala. They have just enough old-style classicism to reassure the conservatives that the home fires still burn bright, just enough modernity to seem of the moment, and just enough brilliance to supply a rush of easy excitement.

Ms. Lang’s “The Gift” begins (like an advertisement) with taped testimonies from young artists about the rewards of dancing. But it goes on to use its music (excerpts from a Corelli concerto grosso) skilfully, for dozens of dancers (students, studio company, apprentices), with theatrical entrances, sequences, formations and exits. And the smooth ensemble casually includes same-sex lifts as well as conventional lifts of women by men. True, “The Gift” felt all preamble and postlude: It built up to, and then away from, a main dance event that never occurred. More, please.

Photo

“Thirteen Diversions,” for four star male-female couples and a corps of eight women and eight men, is as polished a work as the skilled Mr. Wheeldon has ever made. It includes lyricism and virtuosity, striking effects of through-the-body lines and symmetrical ensemble geometry. The music is Britten’s “Diversions” for piano (left-hand) and orchestra. Bob Crowley’s costumes (white for the leads, black with lime trimming for the corps) are super-elegant; Brad Fields’s lighting (separate zones of light, darkness and purple color) makes the entire theatrical space dramatic.

For many, Mr. Wheeldon’s choreography exemplifies the kind of impressive classicism they want Ballet Theater to exemplify. But I don’t care for what little I find underneath its bright surface. Men and women rush all too eagerly into various kinds of automatic rapture — and men seem keener to manipulate women than to converse with them.

“Songs of Bukovina,” by contrast, wants to look more mild and derivative than it really is. It’s an example of the piano ballet, a genre immortalized by Jerome Robbins in “Dances at a Gathering.” A pianist beside the stage plays music suffused by (almost invariably) Eastern European folk material, while dancers, in individuated costumes with hints of (almost invariably) Eastern European folk color, suggest atmosphere, emotion, memory, community. This one even has, as in Robbins’s “Gathering,” five women and five men; only its structure is more orthodox (one lead couple, with four pairs as backing group).

In this case, the music is new: excerpts from Leonid Desyatnikov’s “Bukovinian Songs (24 Preludes for Piano).” Alexey Goribol played the score, which showed, as did the choreography, that Bukovina, an area now divided between Romania and Ukraine, plainly has colors, rhythms and steps all its own.

Photo

There are unusual effects of suspense and contrast. Several dances end with people balanced on one leg, as if in midsentence. The ballerina, handsomely dressed by Moritz Junge in red, walks firmly on flat feet in one phrase, as if weighted by her sense of destiny and homeland. But when the pulse changes, she spins brilliantly in finger fouetté turns (the famous ballet step, but here sustained by the male dancer’s hand guiding the woman’s hand raised above her head). This isn’t Mr. Ratmansky’s most individual ballet, but I want to get to know it better: the only dance of Wednesday’s gala of which this can be said.

The gala’s greatest hit was a short film documentary about Project Plié, which since 2013 has been bringing racially and ethnically diverse children to ballet. Touchingly, attractively, the film showed children discovering both ballet and, by way of dance, themselves.

Ms. Copeland — never more charming — introduced the man who has done most for the project, Valentino D. Carlotti. Another documentary, paying tribute to Mr. McKenzie, was also effective, showing us the artistic qualities he brings to ballet rehearsal while successfully portraying him as an amiably safe pair of hands who wants (and achieves) nothing but to keep Ballet Theater going in the same old way, keeping artistic standards high.

The gala and the coming season, however, show that he and Mr. Ratmansky have been revising the company. I applaud, and hope further change and further debate lie ahead.

Like so much of the exuberant food imagery that I’m drawn to in anime, the katsudon in “Yuri!!! on Ice,” a series about a competitive figure skater in his early 20s, appeared as a less detailed but somehow more vivid version of itself. A Japanese rice bowl capped with golden slices of pork cutlet, held together with barely cooked eggs and translucent onions — textures exaggerated, colors saturated, aromas made visible — occasionally twinkling in soft focus, as if seen through a Vaseline-greased lens. “Is this what God eats?!” one character asked another, trembling, cheeks flushed, eyes wide with the shock of its pleasure. What I love about food in anime is the truth in its hyperbole.

I meant to watch just one episode of the 12-part first season when it came out last fall on some streaming sites. My friend Whitney had told me I’d love it, but I didn’t realize how much: I stayed up and watched them all, more and more charmed and hungry. At first, Yuri is anxious. And he makes mistakes when he’s anxious, and he tortures himself over those mistakes. When he’s celebrating a win, or stuck in a professional slump, he finds comfort in katsudon. “Yuri” devotees from all over the world were quick to recreate his favorite dish at home, posting photos of their versions online like ephemeral fan art. They styled the dishes faithfully, with an addition of peas (at the fictional hot-springs inn that Yuri’s parents run in Kyushu, the dish is served with peas). By the time I finished the series, I wanted to do the same, so I asked Whitney to come over for dinner.

The foundation of the dish is tonkatsu, a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet that became popular in Japan by the early 20th century. Tonkatsu may have started out as an imitation of European-style cutlets — thin, flimsy slices of veal and lamb, sautéed in butter and served with a fork and a knife — but Japanese cooks soon owned it, revised it and deviated from the European recipes to develop their own style. By the 1920s, restaurants in Tokyo specialized in thick, evenly crisp cutlets, made from pork and deep-fried, often in lard. They served these in slices, so people could grasp them with chopsticks. Tonkatsu is now omnipresent, under heat lamps and behind glass at convenience stores, and on boards with shredded cabbage at high-end restaurants. In a Japanese home, it wouldn’t be unusual to have one or two in the fridge, like a leftover piece of fried chicken.

Katsudon is particularly helpful if you need to revive one of those cold, just-starting-to-sog cutlets, stretching it into a cheap, delicious meal. The simmering broth soaks into the breading, turning it juicy, drenching it with umami. But make it with a fresh, warm cutlet, and it’s even more rewarding. In his recipe for the dish in “Japanese Soul Cooking,” the chef Tadashi Ono suggested using pork shoulder or loin, so I bought some of both. After a generous salt and pepper, I dipped the cutlets in flour, egg and panko, the Japanese bread crumbs, and fried them in a wide cast-iron pan.

With a plastic mandoline, I shaved half an onion and put it in another pan with dashi, soy sauce and mirin, simmering it until the onion went floppy and translucent. I added ginger, because in her cookbook “Japanese Farm Food,” Nancy Singleton Hachisu writes about adding a little julienned raw ginger to her broth, before sliding the cutlets into the pan. While Whitney opened some beers, I cracked eggs into a small bowl, broke them up with a fork and poured them over the breading. Within a few minutes, the egg was set at the edges of the pan and the rice was ready. I piled everything in bowls and scattered some scallion on top.

There’s always a gap between how the food you make looks in real life and how you thought it might look based on the pictures. I was prepared for it when the katsudon didn’t emit its own light and twinkle cartoonishly, when it didn’t look anything like its perfect, airbrushed, animated muse. But we both agreed, as we cleaned our bowls, that it was just right.

“Are you always around in the middle of the day?” he asked.

“For the last few months I have been,” I said. “I’m job searching.”

“I am too,” he said. “It’s my last year of law school.”

“Never leave a job without another,” I told him. People had warned me about this, but it was only after I’d done it that I realized how true it was. As we neared our doors, I said, “I’m moving out, so you guys can blast your music all night long. The mean old lady is leaving.”

“Why?” he asked.

“I can’t afford this any longer. I’m moving in with my mom in Brooklyn.”

“That sucks,” he said, then added: “It’s not me blasting music. It’s my roommates.”

Which made sense. He was always the kindest and most apologetic when I got angry. “How old are you guys?” I said. “Like, 23?”

Was he sweet-talking me? I looked the same age as my friends, but maybe the dormlike context had fooled him. That afternoon we ran into each other again; he was in a suit headed to an interview. I wished him luck.

Two weeks later, my friend Diana and I were sitting at a nearby bar, drinking vodka sodas and looking at her Tinder app, when my 23-year-old neighbor popped up.

“Swipe right!” I said. “Tell him you’re out with me.”

She swiped, they matched, and she told him I was with her. I followed up with a text, proud to be out on a Saturday night. Here was proof that I, too, was fun. We messaged back and forth; he was on his way home. When I asked if he wanted to join us back at my apartment, he said yes.

Twenty minutes later Diana and I arrived, and he showed up with a bottle of vodka and cans of Diet Coke.

Soon he was laughing, saying, “My roommates can’t stand you. And I was always so confused why a 26-year-old was upset about our parties. I thought you were just an old soul.”

Diana and I danced to “Jump” by the Pointer Sisters, a song he didn’t recognize. Before Diana left at 4 a.m., she whispered to me, “He likes you. Hook up.”

I offered a hushed protest, insisting he was too young. But apparently the neighborly tension had been building, because he and I started kissing right after she left.

When we woke up, hung over, a few hours later, I begged him not to tell his roommates. My transformation from puritanical noise warden to Mrs. Robinson embarrassed me; my dulled brain screamed, “What just happened?”

But I won’t lie: It was also an ego boost. I may not have had a job, a husband or a boyfriend, but at least I could attract an adorable 23-year-old.

Over the next few weeks, we texted constantly and kept getting together to talk about our dating and employment searches and to fool around. When I asked him if I seemed older, he said, “Not really. Mostly because you aren’t working and you’re around all of the time.”

I said: “When I graduated high school, you were 4.”

One Sunday at 5 a.m., he got to experience the pleasure of being woken up in my bed by his roommates’ drunken rendition of “Oops! ... I Did It Again.”

“This is really annoying,” he yelled, covering his head with my pillow.

“It’s payback,” I said. “Now you understand.”

With him, my usual romantic anxiety disappeared. Instead of projecting my insecurities onto him and wondering if I was enough, I just had fun because I knew our age gap made a future impossible. And I was moving out soon.

Not that my mind was entirely free of concerns. I worried people would think we were ridiculous. But when I told my coupled-up girlfriends, they said I was living a fantasy.

“At least you’re having fun,” a soon-to-be-divorced friend said. “None of us are. I didn’t even want to touch my husband at the end.”

Even so, the chasm between my new friend and me was no more glaring than when he said, “Dating is fun. I get to meet lots of people.”

Dating, for me, was about as fun as my job search. And that was because I approached both in almost exactly the same way: with a strategy, spreadsheets and a lot of anxiety about presenting my best self and hiding my weaknesses. With him, though, I worried about none of that.

When he admitted he had no idea what he was doing with women and made things up as he went along, I assured him this wouldn’t change — no one knew.

Our honest exchange was so refreshing. Dates my age disguised their fears with arrogance. Within an hour of meeting me, one had boasted about the amount of sex he’d had, and another, on our second date, gave me a heads-up that his large size had caused many of his relationships to end. How considerate of him to warn me!

With appropriate romantic prospects, I had been overly polished and protective. Just like the men, I spun stories broadcasting fake confidence. But I confided in my neighbor about how hard the year had been and how worried I was about finding a job and a man to love. With nothing at stake, I was charmingly vulnerable.

One evening as we cuddled in my apartment, with me droning on about my man troubles and career fears, he said, “We get so fixated on the job we want or the person we’re dating because we don’t think there will be another. But there’s always another.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I thought that was so true. Even wise. But it’s easier to have that attitude, about jobs or love, at 23 than at 37.

Then one night I came home a little too drunk and encountered him in the hallway. He was the one who almost always decided when we would hang out, and I complained it wasn’t fair that everything seemed to be on his terms. I was pressuring him, reverting to my worst dating default behavior, and he fled into his apartment.

The next day he texted: “maybe we should chill with this. you’ve been a good friend ... we complicated it a little though haha.”

I knew “haha” was just his millennial way of keeping it light, but here’s the thing: In our “light” relationship, I had let myself be fully known, revealing all of my imperfections, in a way I normally didn’t. With him I was my true self, and it was a revelation.

And a conundrum. Because I can’t seem to be my true self when I’m seriously looking for love, when all I’m thinking about is the future. To win the person (or the job, for that matter), we think we have to be the most perfect version of ourselves. When our hearts are on the line, vulnerability can feel impossible.

A year later, I finally managed to be just perfect enough to land a job. I’m still working on allowing myself to be imperfect enough to find love.

WASHINGTON — Let’s just get this out of the way: There are other matters of consequence going on in the world.

But in these fractious times, a series of puppy photos sent by none other than the fun-loving scamps at the Central Intelligence Agency qualifies as a feel-good, stick-it-to-the-man moment, shared by thousands of people who are marooned in office jobs. Meet Lulu, the black Labrador retriever and free spirit who bucked expectations and flunked out of the C.I.A.’s explosive detection “puppy class.”

Maybe it was her shiny coat that made Lulu’s story ricochet around the internet. Maybe it was her soft brown eyes. Or maybe her story just sounds familiar to any American who has experienced workplace ennui: She underwent rigorous training for a daily grind job and decided that sniffing out bombs was not her calling. (And who actually wants that job, anyway?)

The photos were a rare attempt at a cutesy moment from a secretive agency better known for much darker stories. The number of C.I.A. personnel killed in Afghanistan now rivals the number of agency operatives who died in the wars in Vietnam and Laos decades ago. The agency has pushed for extended powers to carry out covert drone strikes in active war zones. So even the course load for its bomb dogs is high-stakes and rigorous.

“A few weeks into training, Lulu began to show signs that she wasn’t interested in detecting explosive odors,” read a statement on the C.I.A. website. “Usually it lasts for a day, maybe two.”

A wellspring of Ms. Lin’s work is New Haven. She went to Yale College in the late 1970s, later receiving an architecture degree there. It seemed natural when Yale turned to Ms. Lin in the late 1980s to mark the 20th anniversary of coeducation at Yale after nearly two centuries of being all male. “Maya Lin has in many ways motivated an entire generation of Yale students,” said Yale’s current president, Peter Salovy, introducing her at a recent campus lecture.

Ms. Lin came up with an unconventional approach for her commission, designing a “water table” where a thin layer of water streams over the oval-shaped face of the sculpture. Her “Women’s Table” is in a central location on Rose Walk, not far from Old Campus and a few footsteps from the main Sterling Library. Yet it also manages to be a serene spot.

The table is inscribed with a sea of numbers in an exquisite spiral. Ms. Lin marks the presence, and absence, of female students through the years, creating a strong statement and pattern. After many years of zeros, the number grows quickly in the 1970s and ’80s, getting to 5,225 women enrolled at Yale in 1993 when the sculpture was finished. It is a meditation on social and gender progress. She is meticulous in her design: the stone is “Lake Placid Blue” as her homage to Yale’s blue and numerals use Bembo font as a link to Yale publications.

“The Women’s Table” is understated, like so much of her work. Though it carries no explanation on it, people seem to appreciate it whether they fully understand its context or not.

“‘The Women’s Table’ is an important landmark,” said Joyce Hsiang, assistant dean of Yale’s School of Architecture and a Yale alumnus who admires Ms. Lin. “We’ve seen many public gatherings, protests or conversations happen using the Women’s Table as a platform empowering those whose voices aren’t heard. Beyond that symbolic and civic role, it really is a wonderful central place that the community gathers around.”

Within a few blocks are a number of other world-class sculpture and architectural pieces. Outside the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library featuring Gordon Bunshaft’s design using translucent marble, there is an Isamu Noguchi (“Pyramid, Sun, and Cube”) sculpture and an Alexander Calder (“Gallows and Lollipops”).

Also nearby is Yale’s memorial to alumni killed in wars. Ms. Lin passed through the Memorial Rotunda in Woolsey Hall often as a student. “I had never been able to resist touching the names cut into these marble walls,” Ms. Lin wrote about the Rotunda. “It left a lasting impression on me … the sense of the power of a name.” In her freshman and sophomore years, stonecutters carved names of those from Yale killed in Vietnam, which she has cited as an influence on her work on the Washington memorial and beyond.

A hundred miles from New Haven is another Lin “table,” this one installed in Providence in 2015. When Brown University established the Institute at Brown for Environment & Society, it renovated a building on Waterman Street on the city’s east side, emphasizing sustainability in the design by Toshiko Mori. Brown wanted public sculpture outside, and Ms. Mori offered to introduce Brown’s public art committee to Ms. Lin. It was a match.

Brown University CHARLESFIELD ST.

“Under the Laurentide” uses a huge piece of Chelmsford granite intricately sculpted to show a topological map of the bottom of Narragansett Bay. From April through October (the Yale piece’s water is off in winter too), water gently flows across the surface, nearly silent, mimicking the natural course of several rivers into the bay. It is a quiet spot for rest and reflection, and small birds often jump into the water. Laurentide refers to the massive ice sheet that covered most of Canada and the northern United States during an ice age, and the piece brings attention to Narragansett Bay and current efforts to clean up pollution.

Nearby on the Brown campus are two new pieces of public art — Urs Fischer’s “Untitled (Lamp/Bear),” a 23-foot-tall baby blue teddy bear, and Giuseppe Penone’s “Idee di pietra (Ideas of Stone).” Near the Penone piece on the Main Green is one of Brown’s oldest and most distinguished public sculptures: Henry Moore’s “Reclining Figure No. 2 — Bridge Prop.” Close by on history-rich Benefit Street are many preserved colonial-era houses, painted in vivid colors.

An hour from Providence by car or public bus is Newport, a seaside resort with Gilded Age mansions. It was also the site of the biggest controversy over a Lin design since her Vietnam Memorial.

The project, “The Meeting Room,” had its roots in the life of Doris Duke, the colorful billionaire heiress who helped remake Newport through philanthropic and restoration work. One key location was Queen Anne Square, an acre of parkland overlooking the harbor in the center of the city. Ms. Duke died in 1993, and two decades later her foundation wanted to remake the deteriorating square again.

Ms. Lin was hired to do the redesign, yet enthusiasm turned to discord with factions debating the plan’s usefulness and attractiveness. Ms. Lin’s aim was to show layers of history and make the park more inviting. Critics called it ersatz history and said the park would become less comfortable — “Some kind of Disneyland fake,” one critic called it.

In the end, Ms. Lin’s plan was approved and completed in 2013. She created three distinctive open-air spaces she calls “rooms.” She used salvaged local stones as foundations on the actual footprints of buildings on the site in 1777, 1876, and 1907. Ms. Lin said she was inspired to provide accessible meeting places by the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and his drive to give people freedom.

Visiting the park made me wonder what the controversy had been about. The “rooms” are minimalist without walls or roofs but thoroughly inviting for people to sit or walk in. They have become popular casual meeting spaces and places to linger. The park’s disrepair is gone and it is a bright, clean place. The park seems at peace with the surrounding area, most notably Trinity Church from 1725 that towers over. Historic inscriptions in the rooms add texture and the effect of the quotes and stones is cumulative. I felt drawn back to the Colonial and other historic periods, imagining the earlier lives in these rooms.

The Foundation Room includes another Lin water table. Water burbles softly from an invisible source onto the long stone carrying an inscription drawn from the account book of a Newport stone mason, John Stevens, in 1726. Stevens’ shop, started in 1705, survives nearby as one of the oldest continuously operating businesses in the United States. Ms. Lin has worked with the shop on many projects, including the Vietnam Memorial and the Women’s Table.

Just 75 miles away from Newport is Ms. Lin’s most recent and largest New England project. At 181 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood, she designed a large office and biomedical research facility for Novartis, the global pharmaceutical company.

The walk to Ms. Lin’s Novartis building from the Kendall Square Red Line subway stop on the T is five minutes and a good introduction to a remarkable area called by the Boston Consulting Group “the most innovative square mile on earth.” What once had been a dirty industrial area has been transformed into a hub for research and development facilities, which in turn have generated a raft of restaurants, residences, and shops. Big Pharma, Big Tech, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology rule the streets, though quietly, not ostentatiously.

An architectural treat on the way to Ms. Lin’s 2015 building is Frank Gehry’s Ray and Maria Stata Center, an academic complex for M.I.T. that opened in 2004. It’s an imaginative structure, fun to see and walk around.

Ms. Lin’s building is striking from blocks away as you see its covering of interlocking blocks of granite. The facade’s unusual perforated stone screen wraps the main building’s exterior and is supported by an aluminum curtain wall — Ms. Lin said it was inspired by microscopic views of bone structure. She did the master plan for the three-building Novartis campus that includes her building; a lovely, small public park; an older research building; and another large new building designed by the same Ms. Mori who recommended her in Providence. Because of angles and irregularities of the street grid, the Lin building from some places can almost look like two different buildings

The building was an immediate hit. Robert Campbell, the Boston Globe’s architecture critic, wrote it has “the energy of exploration” and is “the most interesting new building in town.”

As research facilities are serious about their secrecy, the interiorof Ms. Lin’s Novartis building is private besides the lobby and retail spaces on Massachusetts Avenue’s streetfront. But her building can be viewed from many vantage points on the streets and park nearby, and you can go into the lobby to see what you can before the security entry — including a high, bright atrium with a mass of wood and tall plants and an ingenious sculpture made of hundreds of straight pins. Outside, there is water pooling around a big, round column of the building. It is mesmerizing and comforting. And a glass wall has patterns looking like flowers and also conjuring up the human genome.

Novartis put a high value on the architecture enabling collaboration among researchers, and the company said scientists working in the labs have been pleased by what Ms. Lin designed. The whole place looks and feels smart. The angling of the building promotes captivating reflections, including of other nearby buildings.

As the architecture critic Paul Goldberger writes about the Novartis project in “Maya Lin Topologies,” a book of photographs and essays about her work, “Lin has begun to work with greater constraints than she has ever had. She knows that the greatest challenge of all is not to design without restrictions, but to accept the constraints and then, just as she has done, show that in spite of them you can bring real architecture into being.”

Much of Ms. Lin’s focus now is on environmental work, including what she calls her last memorial, “What Is Missing?,” a multimedia project based at whatismissing.net and aimed at being a global effort to help protect and restore nature. But she continues to design buildings too, including another large one to come in New England: a library at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. Ground was broken this month and it is scheduled for completion in 2020.

A Bonus in New York City

For travelers making a Maya Lin New England trip with New York City’s Penn Station at the start or ending point, there’s a bonus. Her “Eclipsed Time” sculpture, installed in 1994 high above the Long Island Railroad’s corridor near 34th Street and Seventh Avenue, is a wonderful conceptual clock.

Despite its location in such a busy place, and perhaps because of that, it is has gone largely unnoticed through the years. Using light, it tracks a rough rather than precise sense of time rather more like a sundial (a plaque even says not to set your watch by it). Like much in Ms. Lin’s work, it is thought-provoking and beautiful.

An unassuming figure, she is known for her past D.J. sets and installing her own toilet — to the chagrin of New Zealand’s plumbers — but is also a confessed policy “geek” who worked for years in the New Zealand and British Labour movements and headed a socialist organization before becoming a lawmaker in 2008.

During the campaign, Ms. Ardern became an unintentional feminist hero when she batted away an interviewer’s question about whether she would have babies if she became prime minister. This week, a talk radio host called her a “chicky-babe.”

In her trademark no-nonsense fashion, Ms. Clark — also the former head of the United Nations Development Program — said that Ms. Ardern had received “more than her fair share of very silly comments” during the campaign but voiced hope that New Zealanders would now “let her get on with the job” of governing.

In New Zealand, political parties must band together to form a coalition government if no party wins enough seats to govern outright. Labour did not win the most seats in the September election; that distinction went to the center-right National Party, led by the incumbent prime minister, Bill English.

But National did not win enough to govern alone, and the decision about who would become prime minister was left to the eccentric, populist leader of a minor party, Winston Peters of New Zealand First.

Photo

Weeks of negotiations followed before Mr. Peters threw his weight behind Ms. Ardern on Thursday night. Neither she nor her rival knew Mr. Peters’s decision before he announced it on live television.

Describing herself as “relentlessly optimistic,” Ms. Ardern will now face a National opposition of 56 members clamoring at the gates — smarting from losing an election they believed they had won — and must hold together a three-party governing deal, while also delivering on the change she promised.

The morning after her ascension, at a girls’ high school not far away from Parliament, final-year students were buzzing at the prospect.

Mia Faiumu, 18, and Narjis al-Zaidi, 17, two leaders of the feminist club at the school, Wellington East Girls’ College, hoped Ms. Ardern would improve the national curriculum for sex and consent education as well as decriminalize abortion, as she had promised (abortion is permissible in New Zealand with a doctor’s approval but remains illegal).

“She understands what it’s like to be a young woman today,” said Ms. Faiumu, who voted for Labour in this, her first, election. Before Ms. Ardern’s rise to leader, she said, her vote would have gone to the further-left Green Party, which will support Labour to pass its laws.

But she had been “hooked in by Jacindamania,” she said, using the term coined by the news media to describe the new leader’s ardent fans.

“Anyone who is marginalized would know that New Zealand isn’t the most progressive country if you’re not well-off or a man,” Ms. al-Zaidi said, adding that she thought Ms. Ardern would change that.

The young women enthused about Ms. Ardern’s “big vision,” saying they felt empowered by her win in spite of critics’ saying she could not deliver on such bold ideas.

The expectations for Ms. Ardern now are stacked high: from action on child poverty to solving a housing crisis and an increase in homelessness, she must also balance farming interests — the mainstay of New Zealand’s export market — with her party’s promise to clean up waterways and take action on climate change.

Ms. Clark, the former prime minister — whose office once employed a younger Ms. Ardern — said she believed it was “absolutely realistic” that the new prime minister could fill such a tall order, particularly in resolving the housing crisis, which she called a “disaster.”

In announcing his preference to have Ms. Ardern lead the country, the minor party leader, Mr. Peters, said that capitalism had failed the poorest New Zealanders.

A populist who has traditionally run on an anti-immigration platform, Mr. Peters said Ms. Ardern’s party was the one to steer New Zealand away from neoliberalism, favored by the National Party, which had governed New Zealand for the past nine years.

But some analysts questioned how radical Ms. Ardern’s economic agenda really was. The prominent economist Ganesh Nana said that far from a socialist figure in the mold of Bernie Sanders, Ms. Ardern was offering a fairly mainstream fiscal plan unlikely to be seen as upending capitalism in New Zealand.

“Labour’s policies didn’t change in the leadership transfer from Andrew Little to Jacinda Ardern,” Mr. Nana said. “They just found someone who could sell them.”

He predicted some elements of social and economic change would emerge under Ms. Ardern’s leadership.

“I think it will change the tenor of the discussion and debate about the balance between the haves and have-nots,” he said. “Will it be enough to satisfy progressives who voted for her? We’ll have to wait and see.”

Previous New Zealand coalition governments had proved fractious at times, and Ms. Clark, who has run three of them, said it was crucial to establish regular communication between party leaders so that no partner in the deal was left surprised. She said that aligned with Ms. Ardern’s strongest suit.

“She communicates a lot of empathy with people, and that makes her a very inclusive person,” Ms. Clark said. “She gives people the impression — and I think it’s a reality — that she’s interested in them.”

In Wellington on Friday, women’s advocates were waiting to hear how Ms. Ardern would use those skills to advance their agenda.

Citing New Zealand’s relatively high domestic violence rates and the fact that Parliament was still only 38 percent female, the president of the National Council of Women, Vanisa Dhiru, said Ms. Ardern’s appointment did not necessarily mean a victory for gender equality.

“In some ways, not enough has changed from 1893, when New Zealand first gave women the vote,” she said, mentioning sexual violence and the gender pay gap. “We need stronger initiatives and plans to move the dial for women.”

VARIETY PUZZLE — Fear, or the lack of it, is such a great subject for a column about puzzle solving. Fear can hold people back in many facets of their lives, but it’s especially true when it comes to learning to solve puzzles. For some reason, many people have surprisingly little faith in their abilities, and I wish I could convince them that they know so much more than they think they do and can do so much more than they believe they can.

Aisha Tyler, actress and co-host of CBS’s “The Talk,” demonstrates this by regaling readers of her book, “Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation,” with tales of mistakes she has made and decisions she has deeply regretted. All of these are told to let us in on the wisdom she has learned along the way, and might serve to make people feel a lot better about themselves. Nothing binds us like our shared human foibles.

Today’s acrostic has more wordplay than I’ve seen in a while, which makes the puzzle harder, but ultimately more delightful to solve. I loved clue F, “What some people do to think?” for SHUDDER (as in “I shudder to think ... ”), K’s “Observer getting no help” for NAKED EYE and W’s “Gale known for blowing out of Kansas” for DOROTHY, whose surname was Gale.

The last major tax overhaul, which passed in 1986, took nearly 11 months from introduction to presidential signature.

“Some have described Washington as the slowest town until it is the fastest town,” said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax Policy in the House Ways and Means Committee, “and I think that’s what’s going to happen here.”

Congressional Republicans are under intense pressure from campaign donors, business groups and the White House to deliver a major legislative victory after nine months of congressional disappointment on big issues. Party leaders say they have learned from those setbacks, including the collapse of the health care push this summer.

Lawmakers “should have had a bill six months ago,” said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, who is advising the White House on the tax effort. “They will look so incompetent if they don’t get this done,” he said, adding that Republicans know the economy could suffer and that they could lose badly in the midterm elections next year if they do not pass something quickly. “Ultimately, that’s why I’m optimistic.”

The bills being drafted, as described by top Republicans and lobbyists, would affect family budgets across the United States, by altering tax brackets and some popular deductions, and investment decisions around the globe, by changing the way the United States taxes multinational companies. It centers on deep cuts to business tax rates, which Republicans promise will deliver income gains to middle-class workers.

Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress released an outline of their plan in September, which included reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a doubling of the standard deduction for individual income tax filers and the elimination of several widely claimed deductions for individuals. The framework put down a marker but left dozens of questions unresolved, many of them potentially worth billions of dollars to businesses and the federal government.

Business groups are meeting frequently with key Republicans, seeking to shape the bill, but no snippets of legislative text have yet become public.

However, party leaders cannot finalize a bill until another budget hurdle is cleared — the Senate and House must agree on a consensus budget document, which will include instructions for how much a tax bill could reduce federal tax revenues over the next decade. That document, which would be an agreement between the House and Senate, is crucial to allowing Republicans to change tax law without any Democratic support. Such agreement could come quickly or drag out over a week or more, depending on whether House members agree to the Senate version or demand substantial changes to it.

Republican leaders hope to finalize and introduce the House version of the tax bill as soon as early November, allow amendments from both parties in committee and on the House floor, and pass something by Thanksgiving. Senate leaders hope to pass a bill by December or early next year.

Democrats say that process does not allow time for careful consideration of the bill, or for the sort of bipartisan compromise that marked the 1986 effort.

“I can’t imagine that something this momentous would be done without hearings, when you consider they’re about to fundamentally alter the architecture of the nation’s revenue collection,” said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.

Republican leaders say there has been enough discussion of tax issues to warrant a fast vote. The House Ways and Means Committee has conducted more than 40 hearings on tax issues over the past five years, and the Senate Finance Committee has held 70.

“The quicker we can get this done, the quicker we can start growing the economy,” said Matthew M. Miller, a vice president for the Business Roundtable who handles tax issues. “There’s been thorough opportunity to have discussions on what the policy needs to be.”

Michael A. Steel, a managing director at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington and a longtime aide to John A. Boehner, the former House speaker, said that he expected “an intense, if not frenetic” debate between the introduction of the bill and the votes in committee and on the floor. Businesses, he added, were preparing their arguments in the hopes of changing any provisions that could hurt them financially.

He said he was optimistic that the House could finish its work by the end of November — a contrast to several fiscal fights waged in late December when Mr. Boehner was speaker and Barack Obama was president.

“This is a wrinkle, having a legislative deadline threaten Thanksgiving,” Mr. Steel said. “We usually screw up Christmas.”

Lately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy, carrying fake news, spreading hate messages (and selling ads against them) and undermining American democracy. What I learned is that, for better or worse, they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monastery.

Road maps, a mainstay of my pre-cellphone trips to Europe, were nowhere to be found, nor were the bookstores that used to sell them. The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport, but that was about it. Everyone assumes you have access to Google Maps.

Once you’re off the major highways, Italian roads are a spider web connected by roundabouts, bristling with signs pointing to the nearest tiny villages but lacking any route numbers.

The tried-and-true method of asking for directions prompted some human interaction and gave my traveling companion the opportunity to practice his Italian. But it was a reminder that human beings are often unreliable. The rental car agent in Milan gave us directions to Siena via Genoa, a route, we later learned, that added about two hours to the trip.

Trying to find a house in the Tuscan countryside by asking passers-by was futile. No one in rural Italy seems to use street addresses, which, in any event, don’t correspond in any rational way to actual streets.

Living in the moment isn’t so great when you’re lost.

While I had no phone of my own, others with me had theirs, and I had to rely on them on several occasions, starting with simply finding our house. We had to call the housekeeper for directions (three times).

After that, I relied on borrowed phones, and we used Google Maps for navigation.

I shared my experience this week with Adam Alter, an associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of “Irresistible: the Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.”

“One problem for people who choose to be without phones is, as you found, that people expect you to have one, and infrastructure is designed with the knowledge that almost everyone does,” Mr. Alter said. “You’re borderline forced to carry one for basic utility even if you’d prefer not to.”

Without access to texts or email, I couldn’t see or respond to any messages, no matter how important. I waited three days before breaking down and (again) borrowing a cellphone to check email. But to gain access to my email from an unfamiliar device required a code sent via text to — where else? — my dead cellphone.

Once I gave that up, I was fine, perhaps because I didn’t feel any guilt — it wasn’t my fault the phone failed and I couldn’t check messages. For others, this may be difficult: Mr. Alter’s book reports that checking emails has become a widespread addiction.

At first I missed my phone’s camera feature. I was on holiday in a beautiful country, after all. But after a few days I stopped thinking about documenting the trip and simply enjoyed it.

Without internet access, I had no access to travel mainstays like TripAdvisor or OpenTable. But there were some old guidebooks at the house where we stayed, and major historic sites, tourist attractions and even restaurants don’t change much in a place like Italy.

I found it’s not hard to sniff out a promising restaurant that appeals to your personal taste, as opposed to crowdsourced recommendations. We made some wonderful discoveries. And afterward there were no emails asking me to review the experience (and provide sites like TripAdvisor with free editorial copy).

Mr. Alter pointed out that “this sort of serendipity is often the route to novel, exciting, trip-making experiences.”

He added, “Phones overschedule and over regiment our lives, which robs us of these opportunities.”

I quickly grew accustomed to having no news, stock market quotes or weather forecasts. I’d never want to live permanently without them, but checking out for 10 days was therapeutic.

I read nothing about Donald Trump.

Still, I broke down midweek when the housekeeper asked me what I knew about Harvey Weinstein. The accusations of the movie producer’s serial sexual misconduct had broken the day after I left, and were now blanketing Italian media. I knew nothing. So I borrowed a phone and read The New York Times account and then The New Yorker piece that followed. Both were riveting but interfered with what had, until then, been blissfully untroubled sleep.

After returning the rental car in Milan, I realized that no phone meant no Uber app. That meant we did a lot of walking in what turns out to be a fascinating city. And my anxieties about my return trip proved unfounded. I skipped the check-in kiosks at the airport, went to the check-in counter and got an old-fashioned paper boarding pass with minimum fuss.

I’d never leave home without a working smartphone again. But denied access to the internet, I had time to read several books. I focused more on the people with me and the beauty of my surroundings. I was more open to unplanned experiences. I had time for self-reflection. I’d like to think that, on future trips, I’d use the phone only when essential.

It turns out there’s an app to help people do that.

Called “Moment,” from the software developer Kevin Holesh, it is designed to curb cellphone dependence and promote “a sustainable work life balance,” as he puts it, by letting users set limits on their phone and internet use. (Put aside, for the moment, the paradox of needing a phone app to break you of your phone addiction.)

“Recently, I spent two weeks in a place without cellphone coverage and had a similar experience to you,” Mr. Holesh told me. “It was really inconvenient not to have Maps, but refreshing to not constantly be worrying about what’s going on.

“It was literally the longest stretch of time I’ve not accessed the internet in 15 years,” he continued. “The first few days were tough, but after that, I got used to the lack of connectivity and loved it.”

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

‘We’re Offended Every Day’

On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah said he was not shocked that President Trump had offended the widow of a fallen soldier during a phone conversation this week. Mr. Trump had told the wife of Sgt. La David T. Johnson that her husband “knew what he signed up for” when he joined the military, according to Mr. Johnson’s mother.

“I don’t think we should be surprised that Trump offended this family. We’ve all heard him speak: We’re offended every day. What do you think, a phone is going to magically transform him into Sir Phineas the Eloquent? Like, Trump’s going to be talking, like, ‘All these losers and haters! Bing bing, bong bong — bigly! Hold on, I gotta make a call. Greetings and salutations. My soul is awash in a great flood of sorrow as I reflect upon your circumstance. Where was I? Little Rocket Man!’ It’s not going to happen.” — TREVOR NOAH

Mr. Noah also criticized Mr. Trump for going out of his way to claim that President Obama often failed to contact the families of fallen soldiers, an unsubstantiated assertion that added a layer of controversy.

“How do you start with something so clear and then suddenly veer off track? It’s like Trump was handed the baton in a race, and instead of staying in his lane he walks off the track, gets into a car, drives the car off a cliff, rolls down the cliff, the car explodes, he gets out of the car, dusts himself off, and he’s like, ‘Why didn’t Obama drive?’” — TREVOR NOAH

Yet another European country has swung to the right. Nearly 58 percent of Austrian voters cast ballots last Sunday for the center-right People’s Party or the far-right Freedom Party. It is likely that the two parties will form a governing coalition.

Since the 1980s, the Freedom Party has been associated with anti-immigration xenophobia, anti-Semitism and, more recently, Islamophobia. On Sunday, about 26 percent of Austrians backed the party, giving it its highest share of the vote since 1999. Though the center-left Social Democrats came in second place, avoiding an embarrassing third-place finish, less than one percentage point separated them from the Freedom Party.

The defeat of the progressive wing mirrors the lagging support for the center-left across Europe. In 2000, 10 of the 15 national governments within the European Union had left-wing parties in power. Today, only six of the 28 national governments do. Social democracy in Europe is in desperate need of renewal.

Many analysts continue to misdiagnose the root cause of the populist surge. Too often they blame economic forces when, as a growing pile of research shows, it has far more to do with values. As long as progressives fail to address the values gap, populists will have significant influence on Europe’s political landscape.

Austria’s new chancellor will be 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz from the People’s Party, which garnered more than 31 percent of the vote, according to preliminary results. Throughout the campaign, and like a growing number of mainstream politicians in Europe, Mr. Kurz talked of slashing benefits for migrants, closing Islamic schools, banning foreign funding for mosques and taking harsh measures to deal with the refugee crisis. Some have called him “the Conservative Macron” — a reference to Emmanuel Macron, the 39-year-old French president — because of how, like Mr. Macron, he has distanced himself from his country’s political old guard.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
But in one very obvious way, Waititi doesn’t fit the mold. All those other directors are white; Waititi is Maori, from the Te Whanau-a-Apanui tribe, and so the bet Marvel was making by hiring Waititi was not only on an indie director but also on the first indigenous person ever to be handed the reins of a superhero megamovie. One reason they felt comfortable giving him those reins was that “Boy” and “Wilderpeople,” despite their minuscule American box office, were offbeat crowd-pleasers — indeed, in New Zealand they were blockbusters, the most popular Kiwi films ever made, in part because of the complex way Waititi treated his Maori heritage on-screen.

Marvel asked Waititi to meet in summer 2015. “I didn’t really think this was my cup of tea,” he said. “It’s always nice to be wanted, though.” Given the brief to pitch directing a “Thor” buddy comedy that he would help write, Waititi suggested “ ‘Withnail & I’ in space,” “just these two people who happen to be superheroes making their way across the universe.” (In this formula, the Hulk is the volatile Withnail figure, and Thor must “take care of this time bomb and keep him out of trouble” as they travel from planet to planet.) In their final meeting, Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, asked Waititi why he thought he could handle such a gargantuan project. “Because I’ve been doing it in my head my whole life,” Waititi replied. Feige loved that answer, because he feels that’s how he got his job, too.

Directing a movie like “Thor” requires a daunting set of skills, many of which have little to do with framing a shot: the temperament to manage a set with as many as 1,000 people on it rather than 100; the know-how to oversee complex effects; the canniness to please your bosses; the confidence not to be intimidated by the money, the stars, the vastness of the task. You’re more the captain of a complex, hierarchical aircraft carrier than the solo skipper of a dinghy. At one point, Waititi cheerfully calculated that he was spending the cumulative budget of his previous four films every few weeks on the set of “Thor.”

In the “Thor” universe, “Ragnarok” refers to the apocalyptic cycle of death and rebirth, freely adapted from Norse mythology, and Waititi cheekily nodded to the concept as he finished his coffee and prepared to head to set. “I can either play it safe and do the framing and everything like the way I feel these movies should be made,” he said. “Or — knowing that I can always go back to my small films that I do with my friends — I could approach this in this Ragnarok way, full out, heading for the fire, sprinting full speed toward Armageddon.”

That approach sounded a little scary. Waititi giggled. “It’s terrifying if, like, if you let them see the terror,” he said. “But I hide it really well.”

Waititi grew up splitting time between Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, and the East Cape of the North Island, the setting of “Boy.” His father was a Maori painter, his mother a pakeha (white) schoolteacher. After an uninspired run at studying drama in college (one professor said that his only real memory of Waititi was that he didn’t expect him to succeed), he spent a decade performing sketch comedy, often with his Victoria University mates Clement and McKenzie.

In 2005, his short film “Two Cars, One Night” was nominated for an Academy Award. An 11-minute vignette about Maori kids stuck waiting for their parents in the parking lot outside an East Cape bar, the short is less antic than Waititi’s features would be but is a low-key prototype for the kinds of stories he wanted to tell, which he has described as “either comedies with depressing bits or dramas with funny bits.” At the Oscars, as Jeremy Irons introduced the nominees for best live-action short film, Waititi pretended to be asleep in his seat as the camera tracked to him. (He thought his fellow nominees had agreed to the gag, cooked up over drinks one night, but the rest weren’t serious.) “I had no intention of being a filmmaker,” Waititi said, but the short “got a lot of attention, and I didn’t have anything else on.”

He also had a national film commission that was eager to finance his directorial work. Waititi’s first feature, “Eagle vs. Shark,” was an aggressively quirky romance between two misfits, played by Clement and Loren Horsley. He followed it with an expansion of “Two Cars, One Night”: “Boy,” about a Michael Jackson-mad Maori kid called Boy growing up in the East Cape in the 1980s and his ne’er-do-well father, played by Waititi himself. With its wicked humor and unsentimental treatment of Maori life, it was an immediate sensation in New Zealand, becoming the highest-grossing locally produced film of all time. “Boy” featured Waititi-drawn animation and a “Thriller”-meets-Maori-war-dance number, but just as often, Waititi’s directorial flourishes served to deepen and sadden the film. One recurring flashback is a bloody tableau of Boy’s mother lying dead while his weeping aunties cradle his infant brother.

“Essentially it’s a comedy about child neglect,” Waititi said. “I wanted to do something that showed that even living in the poorest area of New Zealand is funny.” Waititi noted that pakehas were the ones most likely to complain about his depiction of Maori life. “They’re usually disappointed that there aren’t, like, more ghosts in the story.” He laughed. “ ‘Shouldn’t he be talking to his dead mother right now?’ No, because that never happens to anyone. Never happened to me. I’ve never been in contact with any of these ghosts or ridden any of these whales.”

After a mockumentary about vampire roommates, “What We Do in the Shadows” — directed with Clement — Waititi made “Hunt for the Wilderpeople.” A spirited comedy about a foster kid lost in the bush with his grumpy guardian, “Wilderpeople” grapples with grief and puts its heroes in real emotional and physical danger, transforming into a classic family-adventure story that just happens to center on a juvenile delinquent who names his dog Tupac. As with “Boy,” audiences embraced a story with predominantly Maori characters as archetypically Kiwi. “He welcomed everyone into Maori culture,” says the Maori actor Rachel House, who played a maniacal child-protection officer in “Wilderpeople” and is also in “Ragnarok.” The film surpassed the domestic box-office record set by “Boy” in a month and a half.

In hiring Waititi for “Thor,” Marvel found a director with an anarchic visual aesthetic whose storytelling interests were nonetheless deeply, satisfyingly conventional. “In a lot of my films,” Waititi said, “the biggest theme is family, making families out of those around you.” That theme drives Marvel Studios’ “Guardians of the Galaxy” series, an unexpected hit whose energy the third “Thor” movie seems designed to replicate.

Thanks to Waititi’s dogged geniality, the 84 days of principal photography for “Thor: Ragnarok” were, according to basically everyone, pretty fun. He opened the shoot with a ceremony featuring ritual dances and greetings from the local Aboriginal tribe, the Bundjalung people, as well as a Maori celebrant. “A set should be like a family, except that you all actually like each other,” Waititi said. “We just play music all day, we dance, we talk.” At times it seemed Waititi — dancing, blasting disco — was putting on a one-man show with unflagging enthusiasm. Waititi’s favorite gag, according to his star, Chris Hemsworth, was to “forget” his set mike was on and then to perform complaints about his leading actor, midtake, for everyone to hear: “Ah, we should’ve got the other Chris. Chris Pine, Chris Pratt, anything but Hemsworth.” Then there’d be a muffled scrabbling, and Waititi would say, “Oh, crap — sorry, guys, sorry.”

Cornel Ozies, an Australian Aboriginal filmmaker who was one of eight native people Waititi invited to shadow him on the “Ragnarok” shoot, characterizes Waititi’s on-set style as specifically indigenous: “If you talk about his Maori heritage, it’s big families. When you have big families, you’re going to have a lot of clashes,” adding, “you pick up the skill set of being a mediator.” For Waititi, the choice to maintain this disposition, which he calls “Happy Taika,” underlies his entire directorial philosophy. “I’ve been on a lot of film sets,” he said, “and I’ve always promised myself I wouldn’t create a set where people dread coming to work.” He made a face like a kid tasting something sour. “Shooting a movie should be fun! It’s not a real job. It can be hard, but at the end of the day we’re dressing up and playing pretend.”

Waititi found that a production this size lessened the responsibility he had to take on, making the job of a director a simpler one. On his earlier films, Waititi often felt he had to do everything. “When it’s low-budget,” he said, “every job you take is one you don’t have to pay someone else to do.” Here there were hundreds of crew members around, which encouraged Waititi to delegate. On those other films too, he knew that any decision he made about lighting, sets, even performances was “basically baked in forever.” On “Thor,” where digital artists waited to paint over every frame, that pressure was lessened. “In some ways,” Waititi observed, “this makes you feel a little lazier. You’re like” — he waved his hand dismissively — “ ‘Ah, I’m sure it’ll be fine later.’ ”

On a set where every action shot was previsualized and every stunt was choreographed, it wasn’t always easy to direct instinctively, as Waititi was used to doing. “Sometimes,” he acknowledged, “it’s just too late to say, ‘Oh, man, wouldn’t it be cool if like a thousand robots came in and Thor fell off a cliff?’ ” But he still found ways to play. One day, while doing the motion-capture for Korg, Waititi rushed into a battle sequence wielding a big prop hammer, then flipped the hammer around and started pretending to shoot it like a gun. “O.K., CGI,” he declared, “I want you to turn that hammer into a gun hammer.” In the finished movie, that dumb idea is a delightful reality.

Pretending at this scale is a lot easier for an indie director, of course, when he’s working inside a system expressly designed to have megamovie training wheels. Waititi was surrounded, the Marvel executive producer Brad Winderbaum noted, with experienced, talented technicians. Once the shoot was over, he had a year of postproduction to hone the story and several weeks of scheduled reshoots to fix anything that went wrong the first time around. “He’s never going to feel out at sea, wondering how he’s going to achieve this,” Winderbaum said, and then with a shrug offered a fittingly superhuman claim of omnipotence: “We know how to achieve everything.”

If Waititi, with his sense of frenetic rhythm, were to depict the long process of navigating security on Disney’s Hollywood lot and finding him in the “Thor: Ragnarok” postproduction suite, it would all zip past in a four-second montage of opening doors. The broad stone gate on Alameda Avenue, mouse ears embedded at the top of its arch, as the barricade swings into the air. The gentle fwoomp of the entrance to the Frank G. Wells building releasing the building’s air-conditioned atmosphere. A publicist’s waving her key card at the security console at a glass door in Marvel Studios headquarters, surveilled by a life-size Iron Man. The laminated sign Scotch-taped to an otherwise-anonymous wooden door as it opens: CREATURE REPORT.

“That’s our code name,” Waititi said in his office with a happy grin. He’s tall and slim, his hair that December day buzzed and gray at the temples, piled pell-mell in a dark Lyle Lovett pouf at the top of his head. It was now 330 days until release. “Hopefully by June, July, the film will actually look somewhat like it should look,” Waititi said. “At the moment it’s basically a blue screen with people in front of it. Its just blue, blue, blue, blue everywhere.” He gestured at an editing bay in the corner, its monitor featuring Goldblum posing before a blue tarp.

“I’m not a massive fan of the postproduction phase,” he said. “I really like being on set and making stuff up.” Nevertheless, here he was, for almost a full year. “I used to really laugh at everyone who was stuck in traffic, driving to the studios in Burbank,” he said. “And now I’m one of those people.”

Waititi walked across the hall into a dark, soundproof editing suite, where the editor Joel Negron, a veteran of Michael Bay blow-’em-ups, waited at the Avid terminal. Frozen on a wide-screen TV was the face of Hemsworth’s Thor, his once-flowing blond hair cut spikily short. “Is that a spoiler?” Waititi asked the publicist, pointing to the screen.

“Not by the time the story comes out,” she replied.

“Ah, you can write that down, then,” Waititi said cheerily. “We Ragnaroked Thor’s hair.”

The haircut is a potent symbol of the brand-new Thor that Hemsworth craved. Up to now, Thor has been the most boring of the Marvel movie superheroes. “I just ended up being the straight guy,” Hemsworth told me. “Sort of the guy from another world who the joke was on him half the time. I wanted a little more wit and charm.” In the first two films, Waititi said, Thor is “basically a rich kid from outer space who comes down to Earth and gets to kiss a cute girl.” He laughed. “This is the most human that Thor’s ever been. Luckily this film’s coming out on Earth, and the audience will be predominantly human, so I think they’ll relate to him much more than they have in previous films.”

Asked by the publicist to explain the context of the scene, Waititi thought for a moment. “Hulk has been Hulk since the end of ‘Avengers 2,’ ” he said. “Eventually, we’re going to have to see Bruce Banner” — his human counterpart, played by Mark Ruffalo — “in this movie.” The scene was loose and funny. “I was Hulk for two years?” Banner asked in dismay. The two heroes were inside a spaceship, an enormous set that was built for “The Avengers” and shipped to Australia at, presumably, astronomical cost. When the scene ended, Negron said, “Three minutes flat.”

“Cool,” Waititi said. “Cut it in half, then it’ll be amazing.” Over the next two hours, Waititi and Negron chipped away, deleting lines they didn’t find funny enough. They watched all 16 takes of Banner’s response, in which Ruffalo’s improvisations ranged from a deadpan “Oh, no” to screaming shock. Waititi by now was sunk deep into the couch. He came upon a tweet from Peyton Reed, director of “Ant-Man.” Looking at his picture, Waititi said, “All these Marvel directors look the same!” He laughed. “Scott Derrickson and James Gunn and Peyton all look like the same person.” He asked to watch the very beginning of the sequence again: “Do we have the other angle, from behind Banner?” Negron opened a folder full of neatly labeled shots, in each of which Ruffalo, enthusiastically pretending to transform from a monster into a human, fell out of frame. Waititi mentioned that he was hoping the camera might pan down with Banner as he shrank; he hadn’t shot it that way back in Australia, but in about two minutes Negron built a rough move inside the editing software, making it so.

“That’s fine for now,” Waititi said. “The VFX team will perfect it later.” One thing Waititi was delighted to discover while shooting a blockbuster is that it isn’t that hard to create a shot he didn’t actually get. “We scan every surface and every part of every set,” he explained, including the entire interior of the bespoke spaceship. “So this all exists inside the computer, and we can move the camera and create moves.”

Around the world, 18 effects houses had started creating the hundreds of shots that would fill in all those blue screens. “I don’t think there’ll be any bits of my particular style, which is, like, purposefully crap,” Waititi said. “I don’t think that’s what Marvel wants. They want purposefully amazing.” He stood and stretched, restless. “How long is it now?” he asked.

“About two,” Negron said.

“Pretty good, guys!” Waititi said. “Cut a minute out of the movie!”

“Couple more to go and we’re there,” Negron said.

Waititi opened the editing-room door with a satisfied flourish. “You’ve got to kill your babies, as they say.”

“Darlings?” Negron asked.

“I wouldn’t say I love them that much,” Waititi replied. “They’re just babies.”

In the summer — right before Waititi, dressed in a crisp pineapple-print shirt-and-shorts combo, delivered a bravura performance at San Diego Comic-Con — the directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were let go from the “Star Wars” Han Solo film. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that the directors’ improvisational style didn’t play well with the screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan or Lucasfilm executives, who in a news release cited “different creative visions” for the split. A fan suggested on Twitter that Waititi should direct a “Star Wars” movie. “Lolz, I like to complete my films,” Waititi replied. “I’d be fired within a week.”

“That particular franchise seems really hard,” he elaborated in September. “There’s not much room for someone like me.” Through its narrow canon, the tone of “Star Wars” has always been determinedly self-serious, whereas the Marvel movies, like the decades of comics they sprang from, veer wildly from high drama to low comedy. And improvisation has been a tool in every Marvel movie since Robert Downey Jr. riffed his way through “Iron Man.” “Taika’s a really funny actor,” says Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie in “Ragnarok.” “So we had a lot of guidance for the improv. It wasn’t a bunch of, like, ships without rudders slamming into each other.” Indeed, Waititi figures, if it wasn’t for his comedy chops, why would Marvel have hired him in the first place? “They want new voices and different ways of telling stories,” he says. “All the work to do with actors, all the rescripting stuff in the moment — that’s what I want to do, really. I’m always going to leave the CG stuff up to someone else.”

It was 50 days before release. Waititi, hair trimmed short and streaked with gray throughout, absolutely looked a year older. The movie would be delivered in its complete form around the beginning of October. “One day I’ll show up and my key card will stop working, I imagine,” he said wistfully. “That’s good. I’ve pretty much come very close to finishing what I can offer, you know?”

He admitted that the final product doesn’t betray much of his D.I.Y. aesthetic. But his stamp is on the film in other ways: in the way he has framed a superhero movie as a misfit family adventure with gun hammers. In the way he Ragnaroked Valkyrie — white and blond in the comics, but played here by Thompson, an actor of black and Latino descent. In the way the native filmmakers who shadowed Waititi learned that it’s possible for an indigenous artist to dance his way through a $180 million movie.

And in the way he ricocheted around the big Marvel ship, putting on a two-year show, using all the tools they bought for him to make something he likes — “a Taika version of one of these movies,” he said with satisfaction. It’s worth noting that Marvel’s next directors and superheroes also look less like Marvel directors, less like the stereotype of Marvel heroes: Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther” arrives in February, and Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden (the writer-director duo behind the 2006 Ryan-Gosling-on-cocaine drama “Half Nelson”) are in preproduction for a movie featuring the superheroine Captain Marvel for 2019. Waititi dressed up and played pretend, and with the help of Marvel’s omnipotence, he can now direct any movie he likes, big or small. As the Marvel ship plows on, churning up piles of money, its superheroes might soon come to resemble the predominantly human audience that watches them on Earth.

Seas have generally been rising in Maine since the glaciers retreated 15,000 years ago. Rising waters had transformed the Damariscotta estuary into an optimal oyster habitat by the time this midden, and another across the river, were created.

The middens around Damariscotta are the largest examples north of South Carolina, said Arthur Spiess, senior archaeologist with the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.

From about 2,200 to 800 years ago, Native Americans visited this site in late winter and spring. The inhabitants discarded the shells in heaps that grew year after year, century after century.

“They were eating oysters like crazy and catching alewives,” Dr. Spiess said, referring to a type of herring.

In later centuries, European settlers viewed the middens as a resource. One company burned the oyster shells for lime; another smashed them for chicken feed.

As the shells were unearthed, however, archaeologists found ceramics, bones and stone tools, and the remains of animals on which the tribes feasted. (Many of the artifacts went to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.)

This and other middens have revealed much of what is known about Native Americans in Maine over the past 4,000 years. The best-studied site, Turner Farm, on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay, has yielded artifacts more than 5,000 years old.

The inhabitants ate shellfish, of course, mostly soft-shell clams. But they also had a taste for deer, bear, moose, porpoise and seal; cod, sturgeon and swordfish; and even extinct species like sea mink and the flightless great auk.

Donald Soctomah, the historic preservation officer for the two Passamaquoddy tribes in eastern Maine, said middens tell important stories.

“To the Passamaquoddy, the shell middens are a link to the past, and give us an idea of how life was at a certain time and what people consumed,” Dr. Soctomah said in a phone interview. “To us, any information about our past is very important, because we didn’t have a written record.”

In an effort to more rapidly assess middens, Dr. Kelley has developed protocols to survey them using ground-penetrating radar. She thinks of the surveys as a sort of triage, a way of determining which sites are at greatest risk of erosion and which are best to study. With funding from Maine Sea Grant, she has surveyed six middens so far.

“If you want to know what was in the western Gulf of Maine 3,000 years ago, this is how you’re going to figure that out,” Dr. Kelley said.

To survey a site, Dr. Kelley and graduate student Jacque Miller pushed a wheeled radar unit about the size of a jogging stroller across the area, and followed a grid pattern at a walking pace. This allowed them to map a midden without excavating in just two or three days (longer for forested or brushy sites).

The radar not only shows the extent and thickness of the middens, but also reveals the detailed layering, including what may have been floors in historic settlements.

More Reporting on Archaeology

Ms. Miller said in addition to the cultural information buried in the middens, the shells are also a record of ancient climate. Researchers can analyze them to determine historic water temperatures and salinity in the Gulf of Maine.

Still, she said, the middens do not get much attention. “A lot of people just don’t know these things exist,” said Ms. Miller. “It’s just not a focus.”

During the radar surveys, Dr. Kelley’s team had some unpleasant surprises. In one case, they arranged permission to survey a southern Maine midden that had been recorded 49 years ago. When the crew arrived with their equipment, they found it had vanished into the sea.

At the conference, Tom Dawson and Joanna Hambly of the University of St. Andrews described the Shorewatch program, which enlists citizens to monitor archaeological sites in Scotland that are threatened by coastal erosion.

Florida has developed a similar network, called Heritage Monitoring Scouts. Dr. Kelley hopes to develop such a program in Maine.

Dr. Soctomah said he keeps an eye on middens in eastern Maine. “We try to do a walk-by after a bad storm, when you are going to see a site getting more damage,” he said.

“It’s bad because they are disappearing so fast, and the knowledge that is within those middens will be washed out to sea.”

Alarmed, Jake’s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

Photo

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

Before walking back to his dorm, where Jake’s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A’s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake? He hadn’t bothered to show up.

The March

The first event of the day was a rally at the Lincoln Memorial, with a lectern set in the same spot where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others had spoken during the March on Washington four years earlier. Meanwhile, soldiers, Defense Department civilians and reporters gathered across the river and waited to see if the tens of thousands of people massed on the Mall would in fact march on the Pentagon.

Jack Walker Then: Marine captain. Now: Retired lawyer.

I slept on my friend’s couch Friday night, and rose early to run. As I ran, I witnessed the morning preparations of both the march organizers and the government defenders. I couldn’t believe what I saw. It looked like prep for battle. Armed soldiers were building barricades, filling sandbags, raising fences, digging trenches, rolling out communication wire, positioning troops. Armored vehicles were everywhere.

Jane Ophoff Then: College student. Now: Retired musician.

Four of us drove to the rally all night long from Gerald Ford’s conservative city of Grand Rapids in a peach-colored VW Beetle on loan from a favorite college professor. We wolfed down coffee and doughnuts and headed straight to the Lincoln Memorial. We joined a large group of good people: parents with young children, disabled vets and a very special 80-year-old woman wearing high silver boots.

Albert Ihde Then: High school teacher. Now: Theater director.

As I rounded the hill beneath the Washington Monument, the breathtaking view before me brought to mind the exodus scene from Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Ten Commandments.” Even wide-screen Panavision couldn’t capture this massive expanse of humanity, stretched as far as I could see.

Jack Walker

My friend Jeannie and I arrived at the Washington Monument and wandered west along the reflecting pool. The streets were closed off and helmeted police clustered near vehicles with flashing lights, visible but out of the way. A tall, naked man was wading in the pool, waving a big American flag, trailed by skinny, hooting boys.

Don Berges Then: Radio reporter at the Pentagon and part-time college student. Now: Retired construction manager.

The press parking area behind the Pentagon that morning was nearly deserted, presided over by a dour Air Force major who examined my news media credentials and directed me to the press office entrance on the other side of the huge five-sided building. He denied my request to shortcut through the building. I would have to walk all the way around. This enabled me to see squads of helmeted, rifle-toting military policeman moving into positions around the building. To my untrained eye it looked like the Army was overdoing it, erring on the side of caution with all these troops. Most looked anxious and younger than me.

The formal portion of the day began at 11 a.m. with music by Peter, Paul and Mary and Phil Ochs, and speeches from torganizer David Dellinger, Spock, the comedian Dick Gregory and others.

Jack Walker

We found a spot near the Lincoln Memorial and sat, listening to the music and trying to follow the speeches. The snatches I heard were full of thunder against the government.

Jane Ophoff

We chanted “Hell, no; we won’t go.” I had a piccolo in my pocket and led a group who followed me as I played “When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again.”

Bill Ramsey Then: College student. Now: Peace and social justice activist.

When a member of the British Labour Party took the stage to announce his opposition to the war, members of the American Nazi Party rushed the stage and turned over the lectern.

Don Berges

I walked down the long stretch of the Pentagon’s broad ceremonial entrance stairs toward its vista of the Potomac River and the Memorial Bridge. Beyond was the Lincoln Memorial and the Mall. From that distance, I couldn’t see how many people were gathered at the feet of the Great Emancipator. The day’s big story would probably be coverage of fiery speeches over there and the whole Pentagon angle would turn out to be a waste of time.

As the speeches wound down after 1:30, people in the crowd began to watch for signs of movement toward the Memorial Bridge, which would take them to the Pentagon. They didn’t have to wait long.

Jack Walker

A trumpet blew and the crowd began to drift toward the Potomac. Press photographers rushed to get ahead of the flow, and antiwar banners and signs sprouted up. Some people started chanting. It had become a political parade.

Bill Zimmerman

Another large contingent soon moved toward the bridge holding aloft several 25-foot banners and a host of colorful signs. They were veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Americans who had volunteered to fight fascism during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. As these aging heroes passed, thousands first cheered and then joined them, eager to pick up the torch they had carried. Soon the march stretched all the way from the Memorial to the Pentagon, 50,000 people.

James Anderson

It was a pleasant fall day, a good day for a short walk in the company of friends. We formed a very earnest group, mostly young, mostly students, all committed.

Maurice Isserman Then: High school student. Now: Professor of history at Hamilton College

Helicopters, already as much the icon of the Vietnam War as jeeps and Sherman tanks had been for the Second World War, whop-whop-whopped overhead, doubtless keeping close tabs for the authorities on the progress of the march, while reminding us of why we were there.

Nancy Kurshan Then: March organizer. Now: Social justice activist.

At some point, the police blocked us from marching toward our preferred route. In response we sat down on the bridge, tens of thousands of us as far as you could see, forcing the government to yield.

Bill Zimmerman

There was no plan about what to do when we got to the building. Some wanted to simply stand in silent protest and defiance. Others were determined to get inside and ransack it. A few planned to deface its outer walls. The more whimsical spoke of “levitating” the building and “exorcising” the evil spirits inside.

Leslie H. Gelb Then: Director of policy planning at the Pentagon. Now: President emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.

It was already late in the afternoon, and the building had few of us, mostly military, doing our usual Saturday labors.







Don Berges

After an hour or so of hanging around exchanging wisecracks with other reporters, I walked back north for another view at the story that was probably unfolding without me across the river. I was brought up short by what I saw. Advancing slowly toward me was a broad deep wave of people, tens of thousands of people tightly packed the full length and breadth of both sides of the approach highways and back across the bridge.

Though the march was not an official part of the day, its details had been painstakingly negotiated between organizers and the Pentagon. The marchers asked to be allowed to encircle the building; they were refused, and told they had to stay in the North Parking Lot, several hundred feet from the Pentagon and across the Jefferson Davis Highway.

Maurice Isserman

Finally, we reached the Pentagon, or that is to say, an adjoining parking lot. Here was where the officially choreographed “resistance” was supposed to take place. Protesters would have the option of crossing a police line, and then submitting to arrest in orderly fashion. Everyone else would content themselves staying within shouting (or levitating) distance.

Joanne Seay Byrd

The Pentagon area was amazing. To my young mind there was a massive crowd chanting and marching.

Don Berges

Some were of an older generation, neatly dressed and smiling, advancing arm in arm with new friends, content and secure in their beliefs, occasionally chanting in unison polite slogans urging an immediate end to the conflict. Others were young, loud and angry; a few wielded crude signs with words so profane I would not dare repeat on the air.

By 4 p.m. the bulk of the marchers had arrived. Between them and the building stood a line of military police, and behind them federal marshals. Several prominent marchers mounted a flatbed truck and gave speeches. Off to the sides were temporary chain-link fences. Almost immediately, tensions among the crowd began to rise.

Noam Chomsky

I was with a group of somewhat older people, suits and ties. While gathering near the Pentagon, facing a line of soldiers, we took turns with the mike.

Standing on a flatbed [press] truck positioned near Corridor 7 at the Pentagon’s mall entrance, microphone attached to my two-way, I looked out over a vast sea of people. Helmeted military police, bayonets affixed to their rifles, and federal marshals faced thousands of protesters.

I was allowed to walk up to the roof and move to the flat part over the main entrance where the protest march ended. There were a number of snipers on the roof along with a few civilians whom I assumed were F.B.I., since they were using binoculars to search the crowd and identify known “subversives.” I heard them call out a few names, so they did locate some people of interest to their group.

Bill Ramsey

A young woman plucked a flower from her hair and stepped forward, placing it in the barrel of a soldier’s rifle. I heard the click of a camera’s shutter. The young soldier looked confused, his eyes riveted on the flower. His face seemed to mirror the same fear that I felt. I wondered, did he also feel trapped?

Sharon Smith

I was saddened, though not surprised, to come face-to-face with weapons-toting military men. Some girls pushed daisies into their rifle barrels. I wondered if the soldiers wished they could fire on us, or secretly applauded our efforts to protect them from being sent off to die for a bunch of greedy rich old men.

Bill Ramsey

Several demonstrators, apparently expecting what was to come and having arrived prepared, put on football helmets.

Don Berges

Every so often a demonstrator wormed past the line of soldiers and ran in arm-waving triumph toward the building until roughly tackled and hauled off by the authorities.

Paul Millman, a Students for a Democratic Society activist I knew, somehow got hold of a bullhorn and began a monologue of remarkable gentleness and persuasiveness. They were pleas to the Gis to recognize the immoral and futile nature of the war, to lay down their rifles and join us. After Paul went on like this for fifteen minutes or so, a small miracle of resistance occurred. I saw one soldier put down his weapon and his helmet and actually walk into the welcoming crowd. Then a second man did the same — or I think he did. We all wanted so badly for such a mutiny to occur that we interpreted any movement by a G.I., any anxious shuffling of feet or replacement of one man in line by another as a giant step toward pulling the United States out of Indochina and stoking the fires of revolt at home.

Leslie H. Gelb

No one in the building that day had much, if any, sympathy for the protesters, especially those waving Viet Cong flags. It was one thing to be against the war and another to wave those flags.

As the crowd gathered, several hundred protesters, led by Allen Ginsberg, Abbie Hoffman and the Fugs, a politically oriented band from New York, attempted to “levitate” the Pentagon. Through a sound system mounted on a truck, the band and Ginsberg led the crowd in an elaborate chant.

Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg of the Fugs, decked out in multicolored capes, provided the music. Ginsberg opened the ceremony with what would become his hallmark “Ommmmmmmmm.” Others led incantations of “Out, demons, out!”

We wanted to raise that symbol of the war off its foundation and say yes to what we believed America stood for.

Nothing happened to the Pentagon, not even a twitch. Not many demonstrators paid attention. However, the planned exorcism, the visual image and its overall weirdness played well in the press. Some justified their use by claiming the absurdity of the war should be matched by the absurdity of matching actions. Unfortunately, absurdity also provided a good argument for those hostile to the demonstration to dismiss, ignore and discourage the participation of serious people with serious criticisms of bad government policy.

By 5 p.m., the crowd’s joy at having reached the Pentagon was fading, replaced by fear among some and a determination among others to instigate a confrontation. The situation grew confused; a number of tear gas grenades were set off, reportedly by accident, while a contingent of protesters tried to make an end run around the soldiers and marshals toward the Pentagon. Federal marshals began arresting people, including Mailer and Chomsky.

Jane Ophoff

It was clear that we had reached an impasse between a teach-in and a standoff.

Joanne Seay Byrd

All was good until the first bayonet I had ever seen was wielded by a guardsman poised to deflect our advancement to the Pentagon wall.

Noam Chomsky

I happened to be speaking when the soldiers suddenly put on gas masks and started advancing forward to clear the crowd. Everyone sat down. Not knowing what to do, I kept talking — to the strangest-looking audience I’ve ever faced. Marshals took or dragged everyone to waiting vans. My audience of gas masks passed by me and I kept talking to a wall of the Pentagon, which I’m sure was most responsive. Until my turn came.

Joanne Seay Byrd

People began to scatter. Contact was lost between friends and groups.

Jane Ophoff

The great majority realized that it was time to disperse just as a radical element of protesters revealed their intentions, broke through barriers and ran toward the Pentagon.

Bill Zimmerman

As they turned toward the building, they encountered the first of two temporary fences. They immediately tore down part of it, which separated the parking lot from the grounds of the Pentagon itself. Marshals rushed over and forced them back.

Maurice Isserman

A few dozen protesters charged up the hillside and the steps, actually making it into the building before being beaten back. Hundreds, then thousands, followed in their steps.

Don Berges

I had just picked up the phone in the press room and dialed a station in Florida when there was a big uproar outside. Loud noises came from objects hurled against the building’s doors and walls. Guards struggled to secure the big doors against a bellowing offshoot of the crowd trying to charge through the entrance.

Maurice Isserman

I thought about what I should do for a few seconds until, saying goodbye to my uncle and aunt, I loped up the hillside after the others. By the time I reached the beachhead before the Pentagon steps, the opening behind me had been sealed. For better or worse, I was committed.

For the next two hours, the crowd battled with the military and marshals, until most of the fencing had been torn down. Soon the crowd, by then about 20,000 people, was within 30 yards of the Pentagon, face to face with a line of bayonet-wielding military police.

Bill Zimmerman

We sat down by the thousands on the grass or pavement directly in front of them. I was in the first row, and like others, I talked to the soldiers immediately opposite me about the war and why we were there to protest it. Some of the young soldiers were hostile, but many were ill at ease, unaccustomed to what they were experiencing and ambivalent about those of us confronting them.

Sharon Smith

I sang along to “We Shall Overcome.” It felt glorious to be part of a massive, peaceful gathering of like-minded folks. The chant started: “Hell, no. We won’t go!” I joined in — but realized no one was asking me to go. Back then, there were no female-inclusive anti-war chants. OK, we weren’t being drafted; but we girls and women were protesting the senseless potential loss of our friends, husbands, brothers, cousins and sons.

Maurice Isserman

“It is difficult to report publicly the ugly and vulgar provocation of many of the militants,” The New York Times’ James Reston wrote about what happened next, in a front-page think piece for the newspaper two days later. “They spat on some of the soldiers in the front line at the Pentagon and goaded them with the most vicious personal slander.” That’s not the way I remember it, and interestingly, it’s not the way that The Times’ reporters who were actually on the scene on Oct. 21 reported it — there is no mention of spitting in either The Times’ or The Washington Post’s news stories on Oct. 22.

Bill Zimmerman

A short distance to my right protesters stood up and moved closer to the troops. M.P.s emerged from behind the paratroopers. Their rifles had no bayonets but were held at their waists pointed up at an angle, directly at the heads of the demonstrators standing face to face in front of them. No one backed off.

Don Berges

The atmosphere was rapidly metastasizing into one of potential violence. No doubt I wasn’t the only one who held my breath when a young man among the protesters took a half-step forward, improbably produced a flower and inserted its stem into the barrel of a rifle pointed at him.

Bill Zimmerman

Calmly, he moved down the line of M.P.s and put each of his flowers into a different rifle barrel. This symbolic act was caught on film and the resulting photo splashed across front pages throughout the country the next day.

As evening set in, many in the crowd began to peel off, either from fatigue, fear of further clashes or both. Meanwhile, the hundreds of arrestees were taken to an impromptu processing center behind the Pentagon. Some were released; others, including Mailer and Chomsky, were sent to the jail in Occoquan, Va. At 10:30, the military police on the front line were replaced by soldiers from nearby Fort Meyer.

Bill Ramsey

With the standoff uncertain but feeling clearly unsafe, I “jumped ship.” Actually, I jumped a wall by the landing’s side stairs and headed up the embankment to the southbound highway. Relieved to be out of the fray, I stuck out my thumb. A red sports car stopped, and the young driver asked me where I was headed. When I said “High Point, North Carolina,” he responded, “I’m headed back to Camp Lejeune — get in.” Knowing Camp Lejeune to be a Marine base near the North Carolina coast, I warily lowered myself into the passenger seat. He asked, “Where have you been?” With not much more than a murmur, I answered, “The Pentagon.” And he said, “Thanks. I was there, too.” He told me that he was expecting orders to be deployed to Vietnam any day and that this was his first, and maybe last, chance to speak out.

Nancy Kurshan

As the sun went down, it became cooler and cooler. The crowd was getting younger and younger. We were on our own. The protection of the older generation was disappearing.

George Kirby

It seemed like a couple hundred buses were waiting to pick the demonstrators up right next to the Pentagon. I’d spoken to three coeds earlier. I walked near them as they searched for their bus. One looked at my short hair and neat civilian shirt and asked, “Are you in the service?” I replied in my best military manner, “Yes, ma’am, I just got back from Nam. I’m what you are demonstrating against.” The girl replied, “We’re not against you. Marines have really cool uniforms.” And they hurried off to find their bus.

Jane Ophoff

Like most others, we were committed to nonviolence, left the scene immediately and found a cheap motel room, where 10 of us packed in with the sleeping bags we had brought. In the morning we would find out that our peaceful rally and march had devolved into an overnight clash during which hundreds were arrested.

Bill Zimmerman

We made bonfires with the picket signs carried earlier. Impromptu speakers used bullhorns to urge the paratroopers to switch sides. We wanted our soldiers to abandon the government and join us, as Russian soldiers had in 1917. Around 9 p.m., one did. A single trooper dropped his rifle, threw down his helmet and advanced into the crowd of protesters. Before he got far, he was seized from behind and led away. We never found out what happened to him.

Nancy Kurshan

We were on a mission and we knew we were right. We looked to the right and we looked to the left and we knew that all of us would remain up until the point of arrest. For hours there was an impromptu teach-in to the troops. People climbed up on a ledge and, using a bullhorn, spoke to the troops. There was an open mike (well, actually a bullhorn) for anyone who wanted to speak. I did not have the confidence to speak, but I was very proud of what people said.

Noam Chomsky

Most of those arrested were young, uncertain, tense. The emotional pitch was high [in the jail in Occoquan]. There were some calls for actions that could have caused major problems. Mailer intervened quietly, decisively, with a touch of low-keyed and effective mockery, helping to restore a mood of serious dedication and to avert self-destructive militancy, an intervention of no small significance.

My unit did not move to the Pentagon until 10:30 p.m. We were not issued ammunition, but it was kept a short distance away. The troops were issued gas grenades. This gave me some anxious moments. Demonstrators could easily grab grenades off the soldiers’ web gear. In fact that happened to troops from other units earlier in the day.

Bill Zimmerman

Soon, I saw draft cards being burned. Many young men in the crowd had not yet taken that step. In the eerie scene, with bonfires encircling the Pentagon, they found the inspiration to do so. Over 200 draft cards went up in smoke.

Bob Gregson

Two things struck me most during that long chilly night as we stood, shoulder to shoulder, with unloaded rifles facing the crowd. First was the hostility of a very few demonstrators. One young man in particular spent the night putting his face within inches of the faces of our soldiers and staring at them, seemingly ready to spit in their faces. Second, our guys couldn’t respond verbally or physically, so it was very hard on each of them in turn. I was terribly proud of their self-control. After all, most of our men were draftees and perhaps had varying levels of sympathy for the protesters, but that man’s actions drew a lot of curses later on. My first sergeant — also an injured Vietnam combat vet — became enraged by that young man’s conduct and tried to jam his rifle under our troops’ legs from behind the perimeter to hit the shoes of that man. But the young guy simply hopped left or right and continued his mental and physical harassment.

Nancy Kurshan

The soldiers would every now and then make forays into the front of the crowd, clubbing a few people and dragging a few others away to be arrested. We sat, arms locked as tight as possible, to impede them as much as possible and to protect one another. In the end they dragged away everyone who remained. Well over a thousand people were arrested, with 780 of us held and several hundred released.

Bob Gregson

Every now and then during the night there would come the word that the demonstrators would attack at a certain part of the perimeter. The klieg lights from the flatbed press trailer would come on, the marshals standing behind our perimeter would rush over to that area with their batons, and a surge would happen. When some broke through our lines the marshals would whack them and, I assume, arrest them.

We stayed all night on the Pentagon steps, with tear gas wafting around us. In one of those surreal memories, I can still see Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara watching us, silhouetted, with a bright light behind him, on a lower Pentagon balcony. I imagined I could even see the distinctive part in his hair!

Pat Graves

From 11:45 to 12:30 the marshals pushed our troops forward from behind in order to push the protesters back, gaining 30 feet. Bob [Gregson] and I did not like this action by the marshals. We were in command of our companies, not them. The marshals were too aggressive, often reaching between our soldiers to hit protesters with their batons.

Jim Laurie

After midnight Sunday morning, tens of thousands had dwindled to several hundred hard core activists. They were ready to be taken off to jail. Marshals barked orders. Demonstrators sang “America the Beautiful” and “We Shall Overcome.” M.P.’s carried them into police wagons.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
in sculpture, Ms. Mack decided to enter all 73 craft categories in the Durham Fair.
PhotoIn 2006, Ms. Mack was at it again, entering all 69 craft categories of the Durham Fair.
“#45 Amy, Amy, anyone,” for instance, refers to the artist’s childhood fascination with Amy Carter.
“I was so curious about her,” said Ms. Mack, who still has the straight red hair, sprinkling of freckles and gently angular features she shared back then with America’s First Kid.
It reads “FACTS FAKES FREAKS.” Ms. Mack didn’t have political intentions when she made the sign last year — the wording came from an old sideshow banner she had seen.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
“I know every artist says this, but I was always making stuff as a kid,” she said. “Plus, you could win a few bucks of prize money and you’d get into the fair for free.” The ritual would begin each August with daily trips to the mailbox to check for the Durham Fair’s entry booklet, which contained the long list of craft categories that would guide Ms. Mack’s plan of attack. (Soap carving and pumpkin decoration were among her favorites.)

Photo

That annual tradition has evolved through many twists and turns into “Junk Kaleidoscope,” a phrase that Amy Smith-Stewart, the Aldrich’s curator, likes to think of as “a ruptured view of the world through everyday cultural artifacts,” she said recently while installing the show.

Photo

Hung in frames, displayed on shelves, or arranged in domestic-scaled installations, Ms. Mack’s new work quietly exudes the motley variety of a craft show crossed with a fair exhibition hall in its mix of stained glass, gilding, silk flowers, neon lights and lots of denim. There are references to early sideshow banners, commemorative wreaths, needlepoint samplers, teen longing, and American heartthrobs.

“I’m interested in my body of work looking like the things that came out of the fair, not in their craftiness, but in their diversity,” said Ms. Mack, who cites as inspirations Ree Morton (1936-1977), Rosemarie Trockel and Robert Gober, artists known for their idiosyncratic use of various materials.

She returns to the Durham Fair almost every year and took road trips to visit state fairs through the Southeast and the northern Midwest. “Fairs are great sources for images,” she said, while assuring me that she is not obsessed. What she does obsess over, she explained, is “their collections of things, the categorization, their repetitive nature.” Fittingly, a large poster-size list hangs at the entrance to the main gallery at the Aldrich, enumerating 73 categories.

Photo

The evolution of the kind of official list that Ms. Mack would eagerly pore over as a kid, the show at the Aldrich mixes existing competition categories, like “#14 Wood, three-dimensional construction” with more ambiguous entries, like “#38 My heart wants more” and “#55 After the fact.”

Photo

The list is also a link to the exhibition’s pivotal origins, Ms. Mack’s epic project, “The Fair” (staged in 1996 and 2006). Fresh out of the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, where she earned her M.F.A. in sculpture, Ms. Mack decided to enter all 73 craft categories in the Durham Fair. It was an act of near-manic D.I.Y. industriousness, done in the name of art rather than heartlandish moral rectitude. She taught herself leather tooling, screen-printing and chair caning, and won dozens of ribbons.

“Art gave me this framework to put around the fair, this permission to allow myself to allocate an insane amount of time to making crafts — all summer, every day, two crafts a day, while working a full-time temp job,” she recalled. Real Art Ways, a nonprofit art space in Hartford, showed the items — adorned with their ribbons. The following year, Postmasters Gallery in New York showed the project.

Photo

In 2006, Ms. Mack was at it again, entering all 69 craft categories of the Durham Fair. “That second time it was more about using repetition, remaking, and memorialization to think about how I was processing these familiar images and experiences,” she said. Ten years later, she was planning “Junk Kaleidoscope,” fleshing out her interest in commemoration. “All the work in the show came from either a memory I have or an image I saw, maybe a very specific object I walked by,” she explained. “But they’re not exact reproductions, they’re combinations of a few things.”

Photo

There are several wreath motifs in the show, including “Conn Con,” from 2017, a large ring of straw festooned with ornamental corn. It’s the kind of regional homage that one might find at the fair, but also an allusion to the false impression of household bliss that the mastery of the “domestic arts” might imply. “How you decorate your house, your curb appeal — it was all very important where I grew up,” said Ms. Mack, who now has work in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Seattle Art Museum, among others.

Ms. Smith-Stewart, who came across the artist’s work in a group show at MoMA PS1 in 2002, while working as an assistant curator, said: “Anissa is interested in the storytelling power of objects, and many of the works have a narrative that can be pieced together differently depending on the audience.”

Ms. Mack’s list is a gathering of ideas that have been percolating in her psyche over the years. “#45 Amy, Amy, anyone,” for instance, refers to the artist’s childhood fascination with Amy Carter. “I was so curious about her,” said Ms. Mack, who still has the straight red hair, sprinkling of freckles and gently angular features she shared back then with America’s First Kid. “She was my ageish, but a little older. And she sort of looked like me.”

Photo

Ms. Mack hasn’t tackled the subject of Amy Carter quite yet, but that doesn’t matter. The list, for her, is a live document for future work. It can be a catalyst (or excuse) to make something new, or a way of understanding something she’s already made.

Everything in the show refers to something on the list, she explained, but some might match three, “and some categories, like Americana, might cover everything.” “Everyone’s favorite angel, 2017,” for instance, a pencil sketch of Farrah Fawcett drawn on a canvas that the artist has molded to look like white denim, could be “#20 Best of the best,” “#33 I never thought she’d take his last name,” “ or “#60 Locations, actors, obstacles.”

“Wreath,” from 2017, is a good example of how Ms. Mack might bundle together different impressions into a cohesive work. It revolves around a story she read in the paper last year about a terminally ill 14-year-old British girl whose last wish was to be cryogenically frozen. The artist printed the condensed tale, word by word, on the surface of around 300 resin-cast rings (tiny wreaths, if you will), and then arranged them among dozens of inexpensive vintage rings in a rectangular grid of foam slots, the kind of display she frequently sees at fairs and flea markets.

Photo

The work shows how nuanced Ms. Mack’s state fair resonances can be. “The girl’s story reminded me of the midway,” she said. “It’s this place of incredible hope, where you might win this huge stuffed thing, but you also kind of know you’re going to lose.”

A white neon sign casting cold light in a dark side gallery transports viewers to the midway’s fleeting alley of rickety rides and ringtoss stands. It reads “FACTS FAKES FREAKS.” Ms. Mack didn’t have political intentions when she made the sign last year — the wording came from an old sideshow banner she had seen. But the relevance today doesn’t escape her.

“The emotions generated in the space of the midway are things that really play out in other parts of American culture,” she said. “The pride of winning something for someone else, the showing off, the hucksterism.” It’s all right there.

Those missives included memes: a cartoon bunny that blew kisses before the words “I Love You” exploded like a Roman candle; a snippet of Jason Alexander as George Costanza in “Seinfeld.” There were long, silly strings of colorful, silly icons. From George W. Bush, who had always worked so hard on that Texas swagger?

“He has gone deep into the emojis,” Barbara said. In her contacts he’s identified as Popsicle. In Jenna’s he’s Jefe, which is Spanish for “boss.”

We only think we know the people who wind up, intentionally or not, in the spotlight. We categorize them. Trivialize them. That’s maybe the main plaint and preoccupation of a joint memoir, “Sisters First,” in which Jenna and Barbara each present reminiscences that alternate with the other’s. It will be published on Tuesday.

“What we wanted to write about in the book was the nuance of people that we love,” Barbara said, and they’ve done just that, charting the distance between public image and private reality. The stories that they tell are often self-serving, and they skim over the failures and wages of their father’s presidency. But they do make you question the caricatures that we blithely traffic in, the assumptions that we breezily make and our reluctance to allow for how much the objects of our curiosity can change.

Their father’s late-blooming obsession with painting: Even they didn’t see that one coming. He skipped the trips to art museums that their mother, Laura, took them on when they were kids.

But after his presidency ended in 2009, he got an iPhone, Barbara said, and “discovered this little drawing app and would do little sketches and send them to us.”

Jenna added: “We would say, ‘Hey, Dad, Happy Sunday, what are you up to?’ And he would stick-figure a little airplane.”

“With his little face waving out of it,” Barbara chimed in. That meant that he was flying somewhere.

The book is stippled with insider anecdotes, my favorite of which recounts a meal that Barbara and her mother shared with Silvio Berlusconi in 2006, when he was Italy’s prime minister and Barbara was 24. (She and Jenna are now 35.) Berlusconi complimented her on her blue eyes, told her that she should mate with his son and, for good measure, announced: “If I was younger, I’d have children with you.” Barbara’s loss, obviously, but she has somehow soldiered on.

I told her that when I read that part, I immediately thought of Trump, and of his various comments over the years about the hotness — in Daddy’s eyes — of Ivanka. She didn’t take the bait.

They’re careful, she and Jenna. They have made clear over the years that they’re not perfect political overlaps with the rest of their family, which is the Republican Party’s great modern dynasty. Barbara, for example, appeared in a video endorsing same-sex marriage back in 2011.

Photo

But that’s not the kind of attention they usually court, and during our hours together at Café Altro Paradiso, where Jenna had ricotta dumplings and Barbara swordfish, they repeatedly registered their disgust with the divisiveness of our national conversation. They don’t want to add to the ugliness, which pains Jenna all the more, she said, because she has two daughters, Mila, 4, and Poppy, 2.

“This moment, as a mother, feels a little frightening, because I’m nervous to have the TV on to hear some of the rhetoric that is coming from the highest position,” Jenna said, conspicuously not uttering the syllable “Trump” itself. “The way I speak about elections and the way I speak about everything has changed, because I’m now a role model to two little humans who I want to teach about love and empathy and compassion.”

She and Barbara, who is single, woke up together in Jenna’s bed on the morning after election night, because Jenna’s husband, Henry Hager, was away, and Barbara had come over to watch the returns, which were still being counted into the wee hours. Jenna wouldn’t say if those results disappointed her, but she and Barbara both expressed a fierce wish to see a female president soon.

“One hundred percent,” Jenna said, and again mentioned her girls. “Mila, the other day in the car, goes, ‘Mommy, Poppy rules the world,’ about her baby sister. And I go: ‘Well, Poppy could rule the world. Maybe one day she could be president.’ And Mila goes, ‘But, Mom, presidents are men.’ She said that.”

From mid-1999 to late-2001 I covered their father’s campaign and the start of his presidency, and I remember seeing them on the fringes of events. I also remember the media’s sometimes cheap fascination with them when they went off to college — Jenna to the University of Texas, Barbara to Yale — and were repeatedly caught consuming alcohol before they were legally old enough to.

“Jenna and Tonic” was a headline in The New York Post. People magazine went with “Double Trouble,” while Newsweek opted for “Busted Again in Margaritaville.” They were embarrassed, yes, but also frustrated by what they insist were exaggerations in many accounts.

Back then I was never formally introduced to either of them. But perhaps five years ago, Barbara visited me at The Times to discuss the Global Health Corps, a public-health analogue to the Peace Corps and Teach for America that sends more than 100 recent college graduates annually into the most impoverished areas of the world. She founded it, raised money for it, is its chief executive and spends plenty of time in those places herself.

Partly because of her focus on health but largely to stir up trouble, I asked her and Jenna, whom I was meeting for the first time, about Trump’s move to make it easier for employers to deny coverage of birth control. He’d announced that just hours before our lunch.

“It does feel like we’re going backwards in some ways,” Jenna said, “and that’s probably as much as I can say.”

Is she pro-choice?

“I can’t say,” she answered. “I’d be in trouble at work.”

Barbara?

“I am very for women having everything they need to live healthy, dignified lives,” she told me.

“Is that a yes?” I asked.

“I think women should be able to make the right decision that would allow them to live — truly allow them to live,” she said.

Jenna shook her head: “He might have wanted a yes or no.” Indeed he might have.

Their father opposed abortion rights but their mother stayed mum, vaguely identifying herself as pro-choice only after the couple left the White House. That approximated the trajectory of her mother-in-law, the former first lady Barbara Bush, who pops up frequently in “Sisters First” and, like the rest of the clan, isn’t exactly who you expect.

Regal? Entitled? Not according to the account of the twins’ visit to the White House shortly after the first President Bush’s election, when they were 7. They discovered the bowling lane in the basement and, using the phone there, asked a staffer to bring them peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

“We were like Eloise in our Plaza!” Jenna writes. “When the door opened, it was not our sandwiches, but our Ganny, who appeared and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not in a hotel, but temporary guests in a historic home, and we were never to do that again.”

Laura Bush is “quiet and bookish,” Barbara writes, but then again not: “Beneath her flats and cardigans, my mom is in fact our closet hippie and Rastafarian.” She dragged Barbara, then a teenager, to a reggae concert in Austin, Tex.

Barbara also writes that while her father can be “loud and unthoughtful,” he “outreads us all.” After Barbara went through her first devastating romantic breakup a few years ago, he called or texted her daily, “just to check in, just to share the burden with me.”

The twins portray him as surprisingly self-effacing.

During his presidency, they spotted an anti-Bush bumper sticker with a withering put-down, and they not only told him about it but turned it into a running family joke. “Now,” Barbara writes, “this line comes up regularly when we want to rib our former-leader-of-the-free-world father: ‘Well, somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot.’ ”

After Jenna, covering the Golden Globes for NBC, conflated two movies about African-Americans by referring to “Hidden Fences,” he quickly texted her to remind her that where verbal pratfalls were concerned, he’d been there, done that and survived. She would, too.

Jenna and Barbara told me that for as long as they can remember, he has brought their mother coffee in bed every morning, including when he was in the White House, because he’s always up first. He brings them coffee in bed when they visit.

They seemed to me a long, long way from Margaritaville. They’re not the Manhattan party fixtures they could easily be. They show considerable restraint. They also show generosity.

Back in January, as Malia and Sasha Obama prepared to move out of the White House, Jenna and Barbara wrote them a letter that acknowledged the challenges that they’d already faced and that they would continue to confront, including “harsh criticism of your parents by people who had never even met them.”

“Your precious parents,” the Bush twins wrote, “were reduced to headlines.”

So were their parents. Their grandparents. Their low-energy uncle, Jeb. It goes with the territory. But it’s also part of what makes that ground so forbidding, and scares many good people away.

SPECIAL POST — Some solvers love them, some solvers hate them, but rebus elements are a fact of life when it comes to solving crosswords.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

Photo

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus. To cancel your entry instead, press Escape.

Entering a Rebus on an iOS Device

Step 1: Click on the square in which you want to enter the rebus. Tap the “More” key on the bottom left-hand side of the screen. Step 2: Tap the “Rebus” key. This will open up a larger square in which you can type multiple letters. Step 3: Type in the letters and then tap anywhere inside the grid to close and save your rebus.

Entering a Rebus on an Android Device

The process for entering a rebus on an Android device is the same as for the iOS process, except that on the Android app, the Ellipsis key [ ... ] on the lower left-hand side is used. Tap the Ellipsis key and then locate the Rebus key. Follow the instructions for entering the Rebus element on an iOS device.

Now that you have the hang of this crossword feature, give one of our free Mini puzzles a try.

Happy solving!

What May Seem Good for New York Is Not Always Good for Its Mayor

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
“When the mayor sends this kind of mixed message, it appears that he does not think his words matter,” she said.
“We welcome the mayor to join us for any of these happening regularly in his hometown,” the spokesman, Reggie Borges, said in an email.
“You don’t put that aside and say, ‘That’s my personal belief and I should go as a representative of Manhattan and New York City’?” Mr. Urcivoli said.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio dug in even further; the mayor, who said recently that he had never shopped on Amazon, urged the audience to follow his example — casually throwing Starbucks under the bus for good measure.

“If, like me, you love your local neighborhood stores, your bakeries, your cafes, your clothing stores, all these things, then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,” he said, to applause from the audience in northwest Brooklyn.

“A lot of this is economic and consumer-choice-based,” Mr. de Blasio said, shortly after his administration released a raft of documents, including a letter from the mayor, outlining why Amazon should base its operations in the five boroughs. “So a lot of people are turning to Amazon and other online options, that’s one of the underlying factors.”

Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group that supported the city’s Amazon bid, said the mayor’s comments looked to be at odds with the city’s public courting of the retailer.

“When the mayor sends this kind of mixed message, it appears that he does not think his words matter,” she said.

A spokesman for Starbucks pointed to the roughly 8,000 people employed by the company in New York City and the benefits they receive, including health coverage, and to efforts like a voting drive in Jamaica, Queens, and hosting meetings between police officers and New Yorkers in its coffee shops.

“We welcome the mayor to join us for any of these happening regularly in his hometown,” the spokesman, Reggie Borges, said in an email.

The mayor, his aides and supporters have defended Mr. de Blasio’s stances as a reflection of his true self and say that anything else would be pandering or false. Some find his honesty — especially when it comes to the Yankees, who can cause headaches for many New Yorkers — to be refreshing in a politician.

“I’m not going to fake anything,” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday at an unrelated news conference. “I’m going to be myself. They’ll have their games and if they win in the end, we will honor them.”

When the mayor adamantly told reporters at the outdoor event that he would not attend a game if the Yankees made it to the World Series, a fan standing nearby shouted: “The city takes precedence!”

After the news conference, the fan, Jerry Urcivoli, 45, said he was aghast that the mayor would put his loyalty to the Red Sox ahead of his role as mayor.

“You don’t put that aside and say, ‘That’s my personal belief and I should go as a representative of Manhattan and New York City’?” Mr. Urcivoli said. “It’s disgraceful the mayor’s not going.”

It did seem only recently that Mr. de Blasio was open to finally checking off a few boxes on his personal mayoral to-do list.

Last month, the mayor attended the opening night gala at the Metropolitan Opera, where “Norma” was performed. It was his first visit to that event. The next day, he visited the High Line for the first time.

But with polls showing him with a 44 percentage point lead over his closest challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican assemblywoman, Mr. de Blasio seems to be digging in again.

“I am a crazed, rabid baseball fan and Red Sox fan,” Mr. de Blasio told The Daily News editorial board on Tuesday. “It is constitutionally impossible to quote unquote root for the New York Yankees.”

It may also speak to both the nature of fandom and to the particularities of his deep devotion to the home team of Boston, where Mr. de Blasio grew up.

“Expectations would be that even when people move to new environments they tend to pick up the allegiance of the team,” said Edward R. Hirt, a professor of psychology at Indiana University in Bloomington, who studies sports fandom and social identity. “If you were the mayor of that community and wanting to build community spirit you’d want to be seen as identifying with that.”

“It is seemingly a head-scratcher,” he added.

Mr. de Blasio’s challengers in the mayoral race were less confused.

“Unconscionable,” Ms. Malliotakis told reporters Thursday.

“If you don’t like the Yankees, you don’t like being in New York,” said Bo Dietl, an independent candidate for mayor who attended Wednesday night’s game, seated behind home plate. “He should not be the mayor of this great city. It just shows his narcissism.”

As for Amazon, Mr. Dietl said he did not use the site, a rare point of harmony with Mr. de Blasio. “I like touchy-feely. I like to go to a store and look at what I’m going to buy,” he said.

Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant and Mets fan, said that past mayors had been rabid in their New York fandom — as Rudolph W. Giuliani was for the Yankees — or uninterested in sports and supportive of the local team, as was the case with Ed Koch and with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Boston native who grew up a Red Sox fan but rooted for the Yankees against his childhood team as mayor.

“As a baseball fan who also doesn’t like the Yankees, I’m following it with interest,” Mr. Skurnik said. But he added, “I don’t think any significant number of voters use this as a guide to who they’re going to vote for.”

Gov. Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, Pete King, my buddy. And Chuck and Kirsten couldn’t join us tonight because they are literally busy voting right now, they will have a budget vote. It should have happened 9 minutes ago, so knowing the Senate, it hasn’t happened yet.

I want to thank Patricia Heaton. Patricia and I do go back a long ways. Because you know what, Patricia Heaton, she is a Hollywood Republican. A Hollywood Republican. That is an oxymoron. Which clearly was the word that Rex Tillerson was searching for.

I just want to say, you all look great, everyone looks just great tonight. We feel right at home. Because this is exactly what our dinner parties in Janesville, Wisconsin look like.

You know this is really our favorite time of the year, just love it, October. We’ve got deer season, the leaves are changing. The beaches are empty, or as Chris Christie calls them, perfect.

I want to promise you though, as I’ve heard a few stories about how the dinner went last year. So I want to put your minds at ease, you can relax about my remarks. I know last year that Donald Trump offended some people. I know his comments, according to critics, went too far. Some said it was unbecoming of a public figure, and they said that his comments were offensive. Well, thank God he’s learned his lesson.

A lot of people, they ask me, you know, a guy from Wisconsin, what’s it like to work with an abrasive New Yorker with a loud mouth? But you know, once you get to know him, Chuck Schumer’s not all that bad.

I know why he’s been so hard on the president, actually— it has nothing to do with ideology. You see, Chuck’s mad that he lost his top donor.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Chuck is 66 years old, which makes him part of the Democratic leadership youth movement.

Now he’s not even here, so I feel like I need to apologize, probably, for that last joke. At one point, I did want to repeal and replace it, but I couldn’t get that to the Senate.

So, when you take a look at where we are this year, just think about it for a second. Think about all that has happened since the last Al Smith dinner. It’s been almost a year ago that on November the 8th, countless shocked Americans broke into tears over the election results. But enough about the press.

The truth is the press absolutely misunderstands and never records the big accomplishments of the White House. Look at all the new jobs that the President has created. Just among the White House staff!

And when you read the papers tomorrow, everyone’s going to report this thing differently. Breitbart is going to lead with, “Ryan slams the president amongst liberal elites.” New York Times is going to report “Ryan defends the president in a state Hillary won.” And the president will tweet, “300,000 at Al Smith Dinner cheer mention of my name.”

You are probably looking at this side and thinking I’ve seen that guy on TV before, I kind of know who he is, but a lot of you don’t know me. So let me just give some basic background facts. Let’s call it, my top 10 facts. And they all must be true because you can find them on the internet.

Fact #1. Like you’ve heard, I’m from Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a fantastic place to visit in the fall. Looking back, someone should have probably told Hillary Clinton that fact. Just saying.

You know, speaking of which, actually, I got a copy of her new book. This thing sums up politics perfectly. She took 8 months, writing 10 hours a day, to explain what happened in 512 pages. The president explained it in a tweet, #I won.

Fact #2. You know, we have primaries in the Republic Party these days. My primary opponent in 2016 was endorsed by Sarah Palin. And I’m really not that mad about it, because Sarah and I actually have a lot in common. We both lost for Vice President, we both debated Joe Biden. And given the current investigations, I, too, can see Russia from the House.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

By the way, I do really appreciate these laughs. I usually don’t get laughs like this except when I am actually debating Joe Biden.

Fact #3. All the experts, the pollsters, they all say that my popularity is going down because of my relationship with Donald Trump. Some disapprove of the way I defend the President. Others say I don’t defend him enough. Fortunately, the media understands all of this, and they choose to ask me only questions on policy and issues.

Fact #4. It’s true, I once drove the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile, which basically meant that people were constantly laughing at me. It was perfect preparation for being in Congress.

You know what we call the Weinermobile in Wisconsin? A chick magnet. It is!

Fact #5. I am proud member of this church. You know, the Catholic Church actually has a whole lot in common with Washington D.C. Either place, it takes about 7 years for someone to get confirmed.

I really wish Chuck were here at this moment right now.

The only basic difference between a Catholic Mass and a filibuster is that one ends with a sip of wine and the other ends with an entire bottle.

Fact #6. As a practicing Catholic, I believe in miracles. In fact, I’ve actually seen miracles.

In 2015, I saw Joe Biden give a 2-minute speech. And in 2012, and there are 3 witnesses who saw this, I saw Mitt Romney with a hair out of place.

I believe in miracles. Then again, I also believed in Brian Kelly when he became the head coach at Notre Dame.

Last year, Notre Dame Football and Cardinal Tim Dolan, they had a lot in common. Both made thousands of people stand up and say, “Jesus Christ.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Fact #7. When people ask me if I believe everything I see on Facebook, I answer, “Nyet.”

Here’s one that’s kind of interesting, Fact #8. The fact that you learn when you are speaker. I’m now second in line of succession since Steve Bannon has resigned.

Fact #9. Every morning, I wake up in my office and I scroll Twitter to see which tweets that I’ll have to pretend that I did not see later on.

Fact #10. Every afternoon, former speaker John Boehner calls me up. Not to give advice. Just to laugh.

Actually, it was John Boehner who was the one who tried to convince me to take this job as Speaker. In fact, and this is a true story, like all of the other one’s I’ve told, he even got Cardinal Dolan to call me to encourage me to take this job. God may forgive you, Cardinal, but I will not.

Talk about pulling the ultimate Catholic guilt card.

You may remember this, it got a lot of press at the time, but John retired after he got the Pope to take an official visit and address Congress. It was special moment for all of us as Catholics in Congress, but it was a really special moment for John Boehner. We all know how emotional he gets, and he decided right then and there to hang it up.

So, Cardinal Dolan, my friend, Tim, I need you to hurry up and become the Pope so that I can invite you to Congress and I can get the hell outta there.

Actually, we have some other things in common. In November a few years ago Cardinal Dolan himself ran for office in the 2007 United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, but he lost for vice president. So Cardinal, join the club.

It was last January, January 20th, that Cardinal Dolan gave the benediction at President Trump’s inaugural. He recited a prayer from the Book of Wisdom. It’s a book that no one in Washington is familiar with.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Actually, there was just this one kind of awkward moment—when the Cardinal talked about the infallible, almighty Supreme Being, the President stood up and took a bow. Both Presidents actually.

The truth is, no one is infallible, we all make mistakes, we all learn. I personally have learned so much in Congress. For example, I learned that tweeting after midnight is a really bad idea, whether you’re President Trump or especially Anthony Weiner. Or Ted Cruz for that matter.

You know, at one point, the President actually insulted me. I know that sounds kind of surprising. He described me as a Boy Scout who is boring to talk to. It didn’t hurt my feelings. What hurt my feelings was when my wife agreed with him.

I got to tell you, I really have learned so much. I learned that in Catholicism, you’re guilty until proven less guilty.

I learned that God is always listening…as is Vladimir Putin.

I learned how D.C. works. I play the good cop. Mitch McConnell plays the bad cop. And Bob Mueller plays the really bad cop.

I learned how to handle insults. Steve Bannon said that I was born in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation. This is amazing—no one knew Steve believed in science!

And most important thing I’ve learned of all, I am learning that becoming Speaker of the House is a steppingstone...to becoming ex-Speaker of the House.

Just because I am speaker you did not have to invite me and I am so honored you did.

And that is because this is really a magnificent event. People, Republicans and Democrats, citizens and Catholics, have watched this dinner on TV for years. We need an event like this more now than ever.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It is an opportunity for us to come together in support of a truly righteous mission—to bring hope to the neediest children in the Archdiocese of New York.

You know, earlier today, Cardinal Dolan brought me over to The Foundling, where they are just doing incredible work to help underserved families rebuild their lives, to reclaim a greater sense of dignity and hope.

We can achieve so much, and we can achieve so much when we tackle poverty eye to eye, soul to soul, person to person. As Catholics, we call this solidarity and subsidiarity.

We are not yet through the worst hurricane season, so we need to be thinking about other citizens who live beyond these boroughs.

It’s the worst hurricane season in recent memory. An inferno has blackened the homes and hillsides across Northern California. Dozens of people are still hospitalized after the massacre in Las Vegas.

So much has been taken.

I think back a few weeks ago, I went down to Houston, and I was on my way to a shelter. The sun was barely up, it was the crack of dawn, and it was already as humid as can be. And you could almost feel the exhaustion in the air.

But we get there, and I got to tell you, this shelter was alive. It was full of life, and hope, and prayer. Thirty-eight counties in Texas, people just out of their homes. And were volunteers from seemingly everywhere, people from the South, people from the Midwest, people from the Northeast.

People were telling me how they just felt they had to be there, that they didn’t care how long it took. They would stay and do whatever was needed. They just got up and came. It was truly something.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

So yes, much has been taken, but not our spirit. Not our nation’s resilience. Not our faith.

So in these moments when people are suddenly isolated and separated from everything they know, it is those unspoken bonds between us, it is that common humanity, which brings us together and lifts us up.

A lot of people are hurting tonight. Please keep them in your prayers. May they, in the fullness of time, find comfort and renewal.

Thank you for having me. God bless you and your families, this archdiocese. And God bless the United States of America.

Cornelia Bailey, Champion of African-Rooted Culture in Coastal Georgia, Dies at 72

['culture', 'island', 'ms', 'community', 'georgia', 'islands', 'wrote', 'champion', 'coastal', 'africanrooted', 'cornelia', 'geechee', 'bailey', '72', 'dies', 'sapelo', 'words', 'left']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Ms. Bailey grew up in one of these, Belle Marsh, and wrote of a childhood that was both idyllic and rugged.
When she was young, Ms. Bailey noted, children were taught to pray facing east; Sapelo women covered their hair in church.
Growing up, Ms. Bailey absorbed Gullah-Geechee culture even as she watched it shrink.
“I call it cultural genocide,” Ms. Bailey said in a video interview in 2013.
In 2004, Ms. Bailey received a Governor’s Award in the Humanities for her preservation work.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Ms. Bailey’s main preservation achievement may have simply been telling the stories of her ancestors and her own life, something she did eloquently in the memoir “God, Dr. Buzzard, and the Bolito Man: A Saltwater Geechee Talks About Life on Sapelo Island, Georgia” (2001, with Christena Bledsoe).

“Back in my youth in the 1940s and 1950s,” she wrote in the book, “we had five Geechee communities on Sapelo and more than 450 people. Today, we have one community left and fewer than 70 people; and I fear for the survival of my people on this island.”

Cornelia Walker Bailey was born on June 12, 1945. Her father, Hicks Walker, often worked for R. J. Reynolds Jr., the tobacco heir, at the mansion he owned on the island. The house had been the centerpiece of a plantation where, in the early 1800s, Thomas Spalding used slave labor to grow cotton, rice and sugar cane.

Photo

Ms. Bailey’s mother, Hettie Bryant, was, like many in the community, a believer in spirits; when the eyeglasses that she was sure she had left on a particular table would disappear, she would suspect a long-dead uncle of having moved them.

“Mama would call on the spirit of Uncle Shed to put her glasses back,” Ms. Bailey wrote, “and then she’d go and do her work and come back, and those glasses would be on the table right where she left them.”

Sapelo, which is about 11 miles long and part of a chain of barrier islands, is accessible only by boat or air. Today, almost all of it is owned by the state, but in the decades after the Civil War former slaves and their descendants bought land there and established several settlements. Ms. Bailey grew up in one of these, Belle Marsh, and wrote of a childhood that was both idyllic and rugged.

The family cooked with a wood stove, the dishes a genuine version of the Gullah cuisine trend now evident along the coast. They had, she wrote, “what most people would call an ‘outhouse’ but we called a ‘toilet,’ because we still used a few words from the French era of Sapelo and that was one of them.”

She would tell the story of how, when she was 3, she died — or so it appeared. She had become sick after eating unripe pears and seemed to expire. Her parents, who had already seen two infant sons die of fever, were preparing to bury her — they had a coffin made — when her mother’s sister, Mary, operating on some sixth sense, got some crushed garlic, “packed it in my nose, my mouth and God only knows where else, and I came around.”

After that, she said, everyone thought she had a some sort of special gift, an expectation that she could find burdensome.

“I just wanted to be a normal kid,” she wrote. “I didn’t want to be able to see the future or predict whether someone was gonna have a baby boy or girl. The only signs I wanted to read were the signs Papa could read from nature, like when the tide is right for fishing.”

Ms. Bailey traced her family to a man named Bilali Muhammad, an important slave on the Spalding plantation who is thought to have come from West Africa by way of the Caribbean and, like many other slaves, was a Muslim, a heritage evident in the distinctive Gullah-Geechee adaptations to the Christianity of their slave masters. When she was young, Ms. Bailey noted, children were taught to pray facing east; Sapelo women covered their hair in church.

Growing up, Ms. Bailey absorbed Gullah-Geechee culture even as she watched it shrink. It disappeared entirely from other barrier islands, and on Sapelo it was consolidated into one community, Hog Hammock, where she and her husband, Julius, acquired several pieces of property. They operated a guesthouse, the Wallow, and gave history-filled tours to visitors.

Photo

Ms. Bailey’s preservation battle was a difficult one, as young people left the island in search of higher education and jobs. In 1910 the island had a black population of 539; by 1970 it was estimated at 175, and when a reporter for The New York Times wrote about the island in 2012, it was around 50.

The island’s school closed in the 1970s. More recently, Sapelo’s limited amount of private land caught the eye of well-off people looking for vacation properties. Ms. Bailey did not want to see it go the way of nearby islands like Hilton Head, S.C., with its yachts and golf courses, and was blunt about her preferences.

“On the verge of sounding racist,” she told The Times in 2008, “which I have been accused of, which I don’t give a hoot — I would rather my community be all black. I would rather have my community what it was in the ’50s.”

In 2012, Hog Hammock residents were hit with a substantial property tax increase that some felt was an effort to drive out the remaining Geechee residents. “I call it cultural genocide,” Ms. Bailey said in a video interview in 2013. Some tax relief was negotiated, though the issue remains a concern.

In 2004, Ms. Bailey received a Governor’s Award in the Humanities for her preservation work.

Survivors include her husband as well as several children and grandchildren.

Although Gullah and Geechee — terms whose origins have been much debated and may trace to specific African tribes or words — are often used interchangeably these days, Ms. Bailey always stressed that she was Geechee. And, specifically, Saltwater Geechee (as opposed to the Freshwater Geechee, who lived 30 miles inland).

“We thought our speech was a bit more musical than theirs,” she wrote in her book, “because we talked a little faster, with fewer rest stops between our words, so that everything ran together. We’d listen to them and say, ‘Can’t they talk any faster than that? People don’t have all day.’ ”

Ms. Grovner said Ms. Bailey had been instrumental in a continuing effort by the Sapelo Island cultural society to establish a Geechee historical village on 25 acres on the island, where visitors could see how people cooked, planted and lived in times past.

“Hopefully we can get it up and going on her behalf,” Ms. Grovner said.

Dear Men: It’s You, Too
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
So many people want to believe there are only a few bad men.
So many people do not realize they are bad men.
So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry.
There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men.
And then they start to panic because not all men are predators and they don’t want to be lumped in with the bad men and they make women’s pain all about themselves.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
We are a long way from that better world, in part because so many seemingly well-intentioned people buy into the precepts of rape culture. So many people want to believe there are only a few bad men. So many people want to believe they don’t know any bad men. So many people do not realize they are bad men. So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry. There is no escaping the inappropriate attentions and intentions of men.

These same people buy into the myth that there are ways women can avoid sexual violence and harassment — if we act nicer or drink less or dress less provocatively or smile or show a little gratitude or, or, or — because boys will be boys, because men are so fragile, so frenzied with sexual need that they cannot simply control themselves and their baser impulses.

Some people insinuate that women themselves can stave off attacks. They insist we can wear modest clothes or be grateful for unconventional looks, or that we can avoid “asking for it” by “presenting all the sensuality and the sexuality,” as Donna Karan has said. With each of these betrayals, the burden we all carry grows heavier.

What this reasoning does not grapple with — and it is a perennial rejoinder to discussions of sexual assault and women’s vulnerability — is that no one escapes unwanted male attention because they don’t meet certain beauty standards or because they don’t dress a certain way. They escape because they are lucky.

Sexual violence is about power. There is a sexual component, yes, but mostly it’s about someone exerting his or her will over another and deriving pleasure and satisfaction from that exertion. We cannot forget this, or the women and men who have been harassed or assaulted but aren’t “conventionally attractive” will be ignored, silenced, or worse, disbelieved.

And then there are the ways that women diminish their experiences as “not that bad.” Because it was just a cat call. It was just a man grabbing me. It was just a man shoving me up against a wall. It was just a man raping me. He didn’t have a weapon. He stopped following me after 10 blocks. He didn’t leave many bruises. He didn’t kill me, therefore it is not that bad. Nothing I deal with in this country compares with what women in other parts of the world deal with. We offer up this refrain over and over because that is what we need to tell ourselves, because if we were to face how bad it really is, we might not be able to shoulder the burden for one moment longer.

In the wake of the Weinstein allegations, a list appeared online, an anonymous accounting of men in media who have committed a range of infractions from sleazy DMs to rape. And just as quickly as the list appeared, it disappeared. I saw the list. A couple of people didn’t belong on it simply because their behaviors weren’t sexual in nature, but some of them were men whose behavior called for a warning and who deserved public shame. Even where I live, outside the media bubble, in a small town in Indiana, I had already heard some of the stories that were shared.

There are a great many open secrets about bad men.

As the list circulated, there was a lot of hand-wringing about libel and the ethics of anonymous disclosure. There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men. There was concern that the “milder” infractions would be conflated with the more serious ones, as if women lack the capacity for critical thinking and discernment about behaviors that are or are not appropriate in professional contexts. More energy was spent worrying about how men were affected than worrying about the pain women have suffered. Women were not trusted to create a tangible artifact of their experiences so that they might have more to rely upon than the whisper networks women have long cultivated to warn one another about the bad men they encounter.

Meanwhile, there was a hashtag, #metoo — a chorus of women and some men sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Me too, me too, me too. I thought about participating but I was just too tired. I have nothing more to say about my history of violence beyond saying I have been hurt, almost too many times to count. I have been hurt enough that some terrible things no longer even register as pain.

We already know victims’ stories. Women testify about their hurt, publicly and privately, all the time. When this happens, men, in particular, act shocked and surprised that sexual violence is so pervasive because they are afforded the luxury of oblivion. And then they start to panic because not all men are predators and they don’t want to be lumped in with the bad men and they make women’s pain all about themselves. They choose not to face that enough men are predators that women engage in all sorts of protective behaviors and strategies so that they might stop adding to their testimony. And then there are the men who act so overwhelmed, who ask, “What can I possibly do?”

The answer is simple.

Men can start putting in some of the work women have long done in offering testimony. They can come forward and say “me too” while sharing how they have hurt women in ways great and small. They can testify about how they have cornered women in narrow office hallways or made lewd comments to co-workers or refused to take no for an answer or worn a woman down by guilting her into sex and on and on and on. It would equally be a balm if men spoke up about the times when they witnessed violence or harassment and looked the other way or laughed it off or secretly thought a woman was asking for it. It’s time for men to start answering for themselves because women cannot possibly solve this problem they had no hand in creating.

Key ISIS Operative in Philippines ‘Taken’ in Gunfight, President Says

He said of Mr. Ahmad, “He was taken this afternoon and that completes the story.”According to analysts, Mr. Ahmad had acted as a link to the ISIS central command in Syria, helping funnel money and foreign fighters to local militants trying to seize territory in the Philippines.
Mr. Hapilon was killed in a gunfight with government forces on Monday along with another militant leader, Omarkhayam Maute.
After their deaths, Mr. Ahmad assumed leadership of about 30 militants still fighting government forces in Marawi.
Mr. Ahmad reportedly funneled 30 million Philippine pesos, or about $580,000, to militants for the attack, according to intelligence officials.
While Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Hapilon may have died, there are other militant leaders waiting to emerge, Mr. Banlaoi said.

Officials were not immediately available to reconcile the different accounts.

In public remarks on Thursday, Mr. Duterte portrayed the Islamic State as an existential threat, and defended his decision in May to declare martial law on Mindanao, the southern island that includes Marawi.

“We have to finish this or we go kaput,” Mr. Duterte said.



He said the police and the military had warned about “retaliation” from the Islamic State in the face of their defeat in Marawi.

He said of Mr. Ahmad, “He was taken this afternoon and that completes the story.”

According to analysts, Mr. Ahmad had acted as a link to the ISIS central command in Syria, helping funnel money and foreign fighters to local militants trying to seize territory in the Philippines.

Mr. Mahmud was also a close associate of Isnilon Hapilon, one of Asia’s most-wanted terrorists and the leader of Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group linked to the Islamic State. Mr. Hapilon was killed in a gunfight with government forces on Monday along with another militant leader, Omarkhayam Maute.

After their deaths, Mr. Ahmad assumed leadership of about 30 militants still fighting government forces in Marawi.

Mr. Ahmad trained at camps run by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in the 1990s while studying at Islamabad Islamic University in Pakistan. He was a former lecturer of Islamic studies at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, one of the country’s top schools.

Analysts say Mr. Ahmad had helped organize and finance the travel of recruits from Indonesia before the Marawi siege in May to join in the fighting. The Philippine authorities have said that about 30 foreigners took part in the monthslong battle.

According to Philippine military intelligence, Mr. Ahmad also facilitated the travel of at least four Malaysians to join the Islamic State in the Middle East, including in Syria. He arrived on Mindanao, in the Philippines’ restive south, in 2014, where he sought out Mr. Hapilon and helped plan the Marawi siege and organize local terrorist cells.

A video released by the military showed him in a meeting with Mr. Hapilon and Mr. Maute as they meticulously planned the siege, which began on May 23. Mr. Ahmad reportedly funneled 30 million Philippine pesos, or about $580,000, to militants for the attack, according to intelligence officials.

Rommel Banlaoi, a terrorism expert who leads the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, said the funds went to help Mr. Hapilon’s group stockpile firearms, weapons and other logistical items for the siege.

“Mahmud, also called Abu Hanadzalah, was being sought by the Malaysian authorities for ties to global terrorists,” Mr. Banlaoi said. “He has been identified as a militant recruiter for the I.S.,” he added, using the initials of the Islamic State.

He said that among the people Mr. Ahmad had helped to go to the Middle East was Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki, who drove a car packed with bombs into an Iraqi police headquarters, killing 25 people in 2014.

While Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Hapilon may have died, there are other militant leaders waiting to emerge, Mr. Banlaoi said.

“I.S. may have lost a very valuable conduit in Mindanao with the reported death of Mahmud,” he said. “His death can severely affect financing terrorism in the region. However, threats of attacks from other terror groups remain imminent. It’s not yet over.”

More than 200,000 residents are crammed into refugee camps, waiting for the military to declare an official end to the operation.

The battle in Marawi has been financially draining and has tested the abilities of one of the region’s most poorly equipped armies. After Mr. Hapilon’s death, Mr. Duterte flew there and declared the area “liberated from terrorist influence.”

We spoke to a few local bagel shops and asked them to weigh in on what makes a classic New York bagel.

• It “should be crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside,” said Melanie Frost, the chief operating officer at Ess-a-Bagel, in Midtown East. And they should be hand-rolled, she added.

• “They should always be boiled, never steamed,” said Philip Romanzi, owner of Bagel Hole in Park Slope, where they use malt syrup instead of sugar.

• Niki Russ Federman, the co-owner of Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side, knows what a New York bagel is not. “It should not be sweet and you should never find blueberries, jalapeños, or rainbow colors in your bagel.”

• For Adam Pomerantz, the owner of Murray’s Bagels in Greenwich Village, New York bagels must have a hole and a generous amount of seeds on both sides, if the recipe calls for them. They should also be slightly well done. “A bagel should be a bit of struggle to bite into,” he said. “That’s what a true New York bagel is all about.”



How would you describe a real New York bagel? And what bagel place in the city do you think gets it right? Let us know in the comments.

Here’s what else is happening:

Dear New Jerseyans,

Do you have a question you’d like to ask your next governor before the election on Nov. 7? Perhaps it’s a statewide problem that you encounter every day — maybe it’s about schools, jobs or health care. Or maybe it’s more specific, like your commute to work, legalizing marijuana or your property taxes.

We want to gather readers’ questions in hopes of getting responses for you — yes, you.

This race — its two leading candidates are Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, a Republican — marks the end of Gov. Chris Christie’s tumultuous tenure and has the potential to shift the governor’s seat from red to blue.

Did the concept of your show change while it was simmering?

I always thought it was going to be more of a PBS show with interesting people in front of a live audience. But it was hard to fill 24 and a half minutes and not go in for laughs, and we were boring ourselves. So now I’m a bored housewife on a funny show.

Do you have a current lifestyle inspiration?

No, once “I Like You” came out [in 2006], I didn’t entertain anymore because I was tired of it. If I have a few friends over, I’ll order in. But I don’t rent tables and chairs and cook for 18 people. I look back on those years and can’t even believe I was that person — I was so obsessive. And the same with crafting. I mean, I make a few things if I’m going somewhere there’s an audience and I can sell stuff. But I got sick of having crafting supplies around me. They take up a lot of space, and I hate coming across a needle on the floor.

You once had a cupcake and cheese ball business.

I was making cupcakes, and then they became really popular. But I always wanted to sell them for a dollar, and everyone else was charging $3 or $4. Then butter went up, and then I got a cockroach problem. So I moved on to cheese balls. And then I got a huge mouse problem, and I was like, “I’m done with making food inside my apartment.”

The cupcakes are gone?

I’ll do it for a special request. Like if there’s a school charity, I’ll say: “You get two dozen cupcakes, but my rules are only vanilla, I’ll leave it with my doorman, you pick it up, you don’t call me, maybe I’ll put pokes on it, maybe not, maybe jimmies on it, maybe not.” And they’re like, “Lady, we don’t even want your stupid cupcakes.” I’m so awful — because I do it because I want to do it, not because I have to do it. When I have to do it, I don’t want to play anymore.

And the cheese balls? They’re such a rarity in New York.

That’s why I brought them back! I mean, it’s a ball of cheese that you can use over a period of four or five days. You just have to reshape it and roll it in more nuts, and nobody will ever know.

You’re a rabbit lover.

I’m on my third rabbit. I’ve had her for three years, and her name’s Tina, and she’s got a deformed paw. She’s seven pounds and the bossiest one I’ve ever had. She’ll stop me in a hallway where I can’t get past her, or, if I’m sitting down, she’ll get behind me and nibble on my back. She’s just in my face a lot.

So you’re a real homebody?

I’m not a shut-in, but I do work a lot on my home, and I’m surrounded by everything that I love. And I think about people who have lost their places with the flooding and fires, and I look around my apartment and think, “God, I would hate to lose that taxidermied chipmunk or cluster of wax flowers.” I’m always amazed by people who don’t do anything to their house. They’re renting their apartment, so they don’t want to paint or put holes in the wall so they’ll get their deposit back. And the way I look at it is, “Oh, it’s only going to cost me $1,500 to trash my place.”

An eclectic mix of accessories and clothing boutiques, home-goods shops like Sayville General Store and some 23 restaurants can be found in the hamlet, along with a four-screen movie theater. “Sayville has such a charm about it, and there is a pride among the residents,” said Angie M. Carpenter, the Islip town supervisor.

“They hold many country-like festivals” — like the Sayville Apple Festival, on Oct. 21, at the Islip Grange — “throughout the year,” she said. “There is a real sense of community.”

“The Porch Is Open” reads a sign on the wraparound front porch of the 100-year-old house that Cathy Cohen, 75, has lived in for 48 years. “Neighbors party on it all the time,” Ms. Cohen said. “Even when I’m not home.”

During Ms. Cohen’s 65-year tenure in Sayville, the hamlet has grown and “changed tremendously,” she said. The dairy farm she used to walk to is long gone, and once-vacant lots are now filled with “huge tracts of housing.” Yet the affability remains in what she said is still “a quaint village.”

There are “an amazing amount of people who never left,” Ms. Cohen said. “They grew up, their kids grew up, and generations down, they are still here. It is a great place for raising a family.”

What You’ll Find

Victorians abound. South of Montauk Highway, the main east-west thoroughfare, grandes dames are set back on deep lots along broad, shady avenues stretching south to the bay.

“A sprinkling of homes have docks,” said Andrea Casey, a salesperson with Century 21 Bay’s Edge Realty. While most of the coastline is reserved for commercial and public use, houses along Sunset Drive and West Lane back up to canals.

At the tip of Foster Avenue, Sayville Marina Park’s three tennis courts, sandy beach and boat docks dominate the waterfront. Nearby, manicured gardens and a gazebo at Land’s End Caterers provide a picturesque bay-front setting for weddings, said Manon Compitello, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who lives in Sayville.

North of Montauk Highway, there are newer two-story houses built on three-quarter-acre lots on cul-de-sacs. Capes and ranches occupy smaller lots. Condos, co-ops, age-restricted rental apartments and an assisted-living facility line Lakeland Avenue, the thoroughfare stretching north to Sunrise Highway’s big box shopping areas.

What You’ll Pay

“We get a lot of first-time home buyers who want to be in Sayville,” said Leesa Byrnes, broker-owner of Leesa Byrnes Realty. A three-bedroom, two-bath ranch in good shape on a quarter-acre lot, she said, will run between $375,000 and $400,000. Homes that need work range from the low- to mid-$300,000s, while trade-up homes with four bedrooms and two and a half baths on half-acre lots will cost about $650,000.

On Oct. 11, there were 39 houses and nine condominiums on the market. The priciest, at $1,199,000, was a restored five-bedroom 1890 Victorian with an in-ground pool on a half-acre. The least expensive, at $245,000, was a two-bedroom, one-level condo at the age-restricted Sunrise Village, a gated community built in 1987.

Good schools are a draw, Ms. Compitello said, and because Sayville is not incorporated, “you get all the benefits of a town without a village tax.”

But “one of our biggest struggles is our lack of inventory” coupled with “lots of buyers,” she added, noting that homes are selling faster and at higher prices than a year ago. The average sales price in 2017, through Oct. 11, was $453,736, a 5.8 percent increase over the average price of the same period the previous year, $428,691.

The Vibe

Locals buzz about plans for the former Island Hills Golf Club, at the hamlet’s northern edge. Developers Gregg and Mitchell D. Rechler, who bought the property last year, have been meeting with community groups, hoping to change the single-family zoning to build Greybarn, a multifamily rental community with 1,378 apartments “geared to keep millennials and downsizers close to home,” Gregg Rechler said.

Clustered in three- and four-story buildings, with rooflines and eaves resembling large Hamptons-style summer houses, the property is being designed to “benefit the people who already live in the community, as well as the residents who live in Greybarn,” Mr. Rechler said. A 22-acre “perimeter park around the property that equates to a two-mile walking and bike trail will have various pocket parks as it goes along,” he continued, including a playground, an exercise park and a dog park. Plans also call for a community farm, a pond, multiple swimming pools and a large clubhouse with a fitness center and screening rooms.

A shuttle will take residents from Greybarn to stores and restaurants downtown.

The Schools

There are 2,948 students in the well-regarded Sayville public schools, which draw from Sayville and West Sayville.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Students in kindergarten through grade five attend Cherry Avenue Elementary School, Lincoln Avenue Elementary School or Sunrise Drive Elementary School. Grades six to eight are served by Sayville Middle School. Students move up to Sayville High School for grades nine to 12.

The latest available mean SAT scores were 533 in reading, 564 in math and 521 in writing, compared to New York State scores of 489, 501 and 477.

Some Sayville properties are zoned for the Connetquot Central School District.

The Commute

Commuters to Manhattan, 56 miles west, can catch a train at the Sayville station on the Babylon branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour rides to Penn Station take from an hour and 16 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes. Most trips to Manhattan require changing trains in Jamaica or Babylon. The monthly fare is $391.

The History

Once the South Side Railroad reached Sayville in 1868, the hamlet became a summer resort. Actors and actresses stayed in hotels and rented houses in the area. From 1909 to 1919, a seasonal trolley — initially horse-drawn, later electric — connected the railroad station with hotels along Candee Avenue, said George J. Munkenbeck, the Islip town historian.

Lately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy, carrying fake news, spreading hate messages (and selling ads against them) and undermining American democracy. What I learned is that, for better or worse, they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monastery.

Road maps, a mainstay of my pre-cellphone trips to Europe, were nowhere to be found, nor were the bookstores that used to sell them. The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport, but that was about it. Everyone assumes you have access to Google Maps.

Once you’re off the major highways, Italian roads are a spider web connected by roundabouts, bristling with signs pointing to the nearest tiny villages but lacking any route numbers.

The tried-and-true method of asking for directions prompted some human interaction and gave my traveling companion the opportunity to practice his Italian. But it was a reminder that human beings are often unreliable. The rental car agent in Milan gave us directions to Siena via Genoa, a route, we later learned, that added about two hours to the trip.

Trying to find a house in the Tuscan countryside by asking passers-by was futile. No one in rural Italy seems to use street addresses, which, in any event, don’t correspond in any rational way to actual streets.

Living in the moment isn’t so great when you’re lost.

While I had no phone of my own, others with me had theirs, and I had to rely on them on several occasions, starting with simply finding our house. We had to call the housekeeper for directions (three times).

After that, I relied on borrowed phones, and we used Google Maps for navigation.

I shared my experience this week with Adam Alter, an associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of “Irresistible: the Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.”

“One problem for people who choose to be without phones is, as you found, that people expect you to have one, and infrastructure is designed with the knowledge that almost everyone does,” Mr. Alter said. “You’re borderline forced to carry one for basic utility even if you’d prefer not to.”

Without access to texts or email, I couldn’t see or respond to any messages, no matter how important. I waited three days before breaking down and (again) borrowing a cellphone to check email. But to gain access to my email from an unfamiliar device required a code sent via text to — where else? — my dead cellphone.

Once I gave that up, I was fine, perhaps because I didn’t feel any guilt — it wasn’t my fault the phone failed and I couldn’t check messages. For others, this may be difficult: Mr. Alter’s book reports that checking emails has become a widespread addiction.

At first I missed my phone’s camera feature. I was on holiday in a beautiful country, after all. But after a few days I stopped thinking about documenting the trip and simply enjoyed it.

Without internet access, I had no access to travel mainstays like TripAdvisor or OpenTable. But there were some old guidebooks at the house where we stayed, and major historic sites, tourist attractions and even restaurants don’t change much in a place like Italy.

I found it’s not hard to sniff out a promising restaurant that appeals to your personal taste, as opposed to crowdsourced recommendations. We made some wonderful discoveries. And afterward there were no emails asking me to review the experience (and provide sites like TripAdvisor with free editorial copy).

Mr. Alter pointed out that “this sort of serendipity is often the route to novel, exciting, trip-making experiences.”

He added, “Phones overschedule and over regiment our lives, which robs us of these opportunities.”

I quickly grew accustomed to having no news, stock market quotes or weather forecasts. I’d never want to live permanently without them, but checking out for 10 days was therapeutic.

I read nothing about Donald Trump.

Still, I broke down midweek when the housekeeper asked me what I knew about Harvey Weinstein. The accusations of the movie producer’s serial sexual misconduct had broken the day after I left, and were now blanketing Italian media. I knew nothing. So I borrowed a phone and read The New York Times account and then The New Yorker piece that followed. Both were riveting but interfered with what had, until then, been blissfully untroubled sleep.

After returning the rental car in Milan, I realized that no phone meant no Uber app. That meant we did a lot of walking in what turns out to be a fascinating city. And my anxieties about my return trip proved unfounded. I skipped the check-in kiosks at the airport, went to the check-in counter and got an old-fashioned paper boarding pass with minimum fuss.

I’d never leave home without a working smartphone again. But denied access to the internet, I had time to read several books. I focused more on the people with me and the beauty of my surroundings. I was more open to unplanned experiences. I had time for self-reflection. I’d like to think that, on future trips, I’d use the phone only when essential.

It turns out there’s an app to help people do that.

Called “Moment,” from the software developer Kevin Holesh, it is designed to curb cellphone dependence and promote “a sustainable work life balance,” as he puts it, by letting users set limits on their phone and internet use. (Put aside, for the moment, the paradox of needing a phone app to break you of your phone addiction.)

“Recently, I spent two weeks in a place without cellphone coverage and had a similar experience to you,” Mr. Holesh told me. “It was really inconvenient not to have Maps, but refreshing to not constantly be worrying about what’s going on.

“It was literally the longest stretch of time I’ve not accessed the internet in 15 years,” he continued. “The first few days were tough, but after that, I got used to the lack of connectivity and loved it.”

Regulator Blasts Wells Fargo for Deceptive Auto Insurance Program
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Last year, the comptroller’s office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo.
For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo’s oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance.
Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.
Wells Fargo’s auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said.
Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
That internal report said the costs of the unneeded insurance, which covered collision damage, had caused some 274,000 Wells Fargo customers to fall behind on their car loans, and almost 25,000 vehicles were wrongly repossessed. Customers on active military duty were among those hurt by the practice.

In the comptroller’s report, regulators said management at the bank’s auto loan unit, Wells Fargo Dealer Services, had ignored signs of problems in the business such as consumer complaints, focusing instead on sales volume and performance. The report described its management of compliance risk — essentially the ability to abide by regulations and best practices — as “weak.” It noted that Wells Fargo in 2015 had characterized the risks associated with this business as “low.”

Wells Fargo has set aside $80 million to compensate the 570,000 customers it said were harmed by receiving auto insurance they didn’t want. The comptroller’s office said that the amount was inadequate and that the bank might have to pay out substantially more as additional victims were identified — partly because Wells Fargo’s analysis of how much money it needed to set aside excluded many years when the insurance was being imposed.

The report does give Wells Fargo’s management credit for taking action after identifying the problems at the auto loan unit, such as hiring legal and consulting firms to assess customer harm, changing staff at the operation and notifying regulators.

The comptroller’s findings are likely to affect how Wells Fargo does business, not just in the auto lending operation but across the bank. The comptroller’s office said it would require Wells Fargo to ensure that all of its business units had effective systems in place to identify and prevent risky practices.

Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement that the bank had made significant changes in recent months to strengthen controls and oversight of insurers and outside vendors with which it does business.

“We are also working to enhance our customer care program and improve complaints resolution,” she said. “We will continue to work with regulators on the remediation and make improvements to our auto lending business to build a better Wells Fargo.”

Wells Fargo stopped the auto insurance program in September 2016.

Once the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency makes its findings formal, Wells Fargo will have time to correct the problems. A spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office declined to comment on the report.

The report did not mention penalties or fines. The comptroller can impose penalties for violations of laws or unsound business practices in an attempt to deter violations and encourage corrective measures.

Last year, the comptroller’s office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo. A report in April by the office’s ombudsman concluded that the agency “must continue our efforts to improve and refine the agency’s supervisory program, to sharpen our early warning processes, and to enhance our supervisory capabilities.”

The comptroller’s review of Wells Fargo’s auto lending and insurance practices has been underway for several months.

The report paints a damning picture of a bank that didn’t monitor its contractors, that lacked the impetus to correct problems once they were uncovered and that proved unresponsive to complaints from its customers.

For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo’s oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance. National General was not obligated to — and did not — alert Wells Fargo to customer complaints about the unneeded insurance, the report said.

And when auditors at Wells Fargo detected and then flagged problems with National General in 2015, the comptroller’s office said, the bank didn’t act on those concerns promptly.

Christine Worley, a spokeswoman for National General, disputed elements of the report. “We believe that our customer service in this area was handled in a timely manner,” she said in a statement. “We work closely with our financial institution clients and advise them of complaints on a regular basis.”

The bank’s lapses in handling consumer complaints and managing vendors are not new. Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Wells Fargo’s ability to track consumer complaints efficiently, for example, had been part of a 2015 compliance-improvement plan at the bank, the report noted. And a so-called consent order in 2011 between Wells Fargo and the comptroller’s office involving the bank’s mortgage foreclosure operations required it to establish a more effective program to manage its relationships with outside companies and contractors.

The comptroller’s office also concluded that the bank’s plan to compensate customers who were harmed by the improprieties was insufficient. When calculating potential damages, the bank limited its payments to customers who were affected beginning in January 2012 and extending to July this year. But the auto insurance program has been in place for almost 12 years, and the bank didn’t calculate potential damages caused for much of that period.

“The number of customers harmed in this time period could be substantial,” the report said.

Wells Fargo also used “an overly complicated reimbursement methodology which lacked clear support for addressing all the customer costs incurred,” according to the report.

Wells Fargo’s auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said. For example, the bank did not break out the insurance costs embedded in car loans; rather, it included the amounts owed on the unneeded coverage in the monthly payments. Had borrowers known what the cost increases were for, the comptroller’s office said, they could have taken action more quickly to avoid harm.

Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges. The comptroller office’s review of loan files and consumer complaints showed that Wells Fargo’s customers often had to submit proof of coverage multiple times before the coverage was canceled.

Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.
They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry.
They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.
It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces.

Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.

A 100-Car Army of Sound in Los Angeles Image Credit Andrew White for The New York Times

LOS ANGELES — There were multiple options for experiencing “A (for 100 Cars),” a new composition by Ryoji Ikeda that had its premiere here late Sunday afternoon.

Image Credit Andrew White for The New York Times

You could look and see 100 tricked-out cars arranged in a phalanx on the roof of a parking lot across the street from Frank Gehry’s Walt Disney Hall, many with their doors open and angled up to the sky. You could listen to the sometimes sharp, sometimes guttural tones that were pealing from their speakers, each a variation on the standard tuning of the note A. Or you could close your eyes and feel how the music pushed against the ears, the head, the skin, throbbing and droning and crashing.

“A (for 100 Cars)” was, by turns, a placid deliberation, a thunderous roar, an ambitious lark. A public sound art installation made possible through corporate largess — the performance was part of the first Los Angeles edition of the Red Bull Music Academy festival — it turned negative space in the center of downtown Los Angeles into a sublime womb. All around, tall buildings loomed, while on the performance stage, 100 cars worked through what felt like a meditation.

Mr. Ikeda’s composition juxtaposed precision and imprecision: 440Hz is the current tuning standard for A, but that wasn’t always the case. Each car here was paired with a historical tuning, with frequencies ranging from 376.3Hz to 506.9Hz. Also, though this composition could have been performed cleanly by computer, it instead relied on amateur performers — the drivers, who in many cases were the creative and technical architects of their cars, but in this case were also the musicians. Each had a pocket-size synthesizer programmed to one specific frequency and a dedicated score instructing him or her how to manipulate the knobs at various points in the 27-minute piece.

“It’s impossible to follow, exactly, the timing,” Mr. Ikeda said after the performance. But he added: “All the drivers were so serious. I was kind of underestimating them.”

The influential photographer Estevan Oriol was in the front row with his lovingly-detailed 1964 Chevrolet Impala SS lowrider. “I’m trying to expand our car culture,” he said. “The lowrider community for the most part only do lowrider community-related stuff. I never even heard of anything like this.”

Among the 100 cars, the lowriders stood out for their candy-bright paint. But plenty of unassuming vehicles with astonishing sound systems participated as well. “Some cars look normal, but inside is like a weapon,” Mr. Ikeda said.

Even the most vibrant speaker systems were tested by Mr. Ikeda’s bulbous tones, which pushed their speakers in directions they’d not previously gone. “Each frequency coming though my speakers, I’d never heard,” said Jasond Moody, behind the wheel of his supercharged 2011 Chevrolet Camaro SS. (Each driver was outfitted with huge headphones.) “If you got a 4 kilowatt sound system and you’re playing 55 Hz at 120 decibels, physically, it’s a real kind of experience,” said Tatsuya Takahashi, who built the synthesizers. “What the driver is feeling in the driver’s seat is very different than what the audience hears.”

Image Credit Andrew White for The New York Times

Mr. Ikeda’s composition wasn’t limited to the stereo systems; it also took advantage of the cars’ headlights, horns and roaring engines. Though in the case of one car, the revving proved to be too much. Just as the performance was coming to a close, Edwin Hammond Meredith’s 1978 Cadillac DeVille began billowing out smoke from under its hood: Clamps securing a hose to the radiator had blown off.

Other drivers and mechanics rushed to help, some pouring bottles of water down the side of the car to keep things cool. Like the sound bath that had just finished, the acrid scent spread through the air with slow determination, making this a concert you could hear, see, feel and also smell.

When in Roam is still in its infancy: Its concierges currently provide just a couple itineraries a week, as well as answering a follow-up question should clients want their interaction to last a bit longer. (Anything beyond that will cost more; a contractor’s take is $12 per $29 itinerary.)

But in attempting to whisk her profession into the Digital Age, might Ms. Miller be inadvertently cannibalizing it, byte by byte?

“For the most part, we’re trying to reach users who don’t have access to a [physical] concierge,” she said. “This might be someone staying in an Airbnb or with family or friends, or hotels without services. At a time when concierges are more important than ever, hotels are eliminating positions. We can both Google ‘best restaurants in Chicago’ and get the same answers. But is your best restaurant my best restaurant? No. It takes the concierge to qualify that.”

Herein, Ms. Miller acknowledges Airbnb, the hotel industry’s arch enemy. Somewhat ironically, Airbnb recently launched an initiative to have its hosts act more like hospitality experts, replete with recommended activities, cucumber water and maybe a mint on the pillow for good measure.

All of this strikes Robert Marks, the chief concierge of San Diego’s Omni Hotel, ascockamamie. Mr. Marks is president of the American chapter of Les Clefs d’Or, a concierge society whose members must display profound expertise to gain entry. To him, if you aren’t staying in a hotel, you may as well pitch a tent in the parking lot.

While he acknowledges that When in Roam “is an option” for people who choose not to stay at full-service hotels, he said he feels that the service is “cold and non-interactive.”

“It’s no better than something that you could find online,” he said. “One of the great joys of having a concierge is you build this wonderful relationship with them. They get to know your life and share their expertise. That face time is so valuable.”

Colin Perceful said he wouldn’t necessarily disagree with the latter half of that statement. He’s a concierge at the Four Seasons, one of downtown Seattle’s more opulent hotels, and also one of the contractors who might wind up filling out your itinerary should you choose to patronize When in Roam.

“That’s kind of where the concierge profession is trending,” he says of his auxiliary gig’s virtual bent.

Besides the beer money, When in Roam currently provides for him, Mr. Perceful says his involvement with Ms. Miller’s company forces him to stay engaged with parts of the city far from the downtown core.

“There’s very little variance among customers in a five-star hotel, whereas with When in Roam, you’ll get bachelorette parties staying at an Airbnb on Capitol Hill or someone staying with their grandmother in Fremont,” he said, referring to two of Seattle’s more happening neighborhoods.

When I requested an itinerary from When in Roam, I asked for destinations and activities in and around West Seattle, a peninsula that’s accessible by either passenger ferry or bridge from mainland Seattle. Coincidentally, Mr. Perceful was the one who snapped up my request, and nimbly pointed me to such hyper-local haunts as Mashiko (sustainable sushi), Sisters and Brothers (hot chicken) and La Rustica, a family-owned Italian restaurant with a location so obscure that you’d have to crash your bicycle into it if someone didn’t tell you where it was.

“The restaurant doesn’t even have a web page,” Mr. Perceful noted in his summary.

That’s true, but the stove sure works.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

Photo

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

Though Monika Bulaj grew up in Communist Poland, she was nonetheless a devoutly Catholic child who studied mystics and dreamed of a life as a cloistered nun. But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
These days, some cars can serve as Wi-Fi hot spots, backup power generators or remote controls for your home. In the future, they might also monitor your health; seat suppliers are tinkering with sensors that can monitor a driver’s heart rate and body temperature.

Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book, the automotive research company, said cars were on a path that resembled the one taken by the iPhone.

“When the iPhone came out 10 years ago, you could make phone calls and text and access the internet, but no one knew how far it would go with apps,” he said. “Cars are going the same way. They are going to serve us in ways and are going to be able to do things that we haven’t even conceived of yet.”

Myriad technologies are reshaping what automobiles can do. Most new car are already loaded with computer chips and have wireless communications links, and they are gaining more abilities in those areas every year. Underneath the sheet metal, new cars also usually have fewer mechanical devices and more electronic components than earlier models, a change that allows for advances simply by changing software.

All of this is allowing auto engineers to expand their imaginations.

That was the case at Ford. After dreaming up his drinking-water idea, Mr. Martin hesitated before entering it into an internal innovation competition. “I thought: This is crazy. I hope nobody laughs at me,” he recalled.

But eventually he and Mr. Rollinger ran out to Home Depot and spent about $100 on hoses, tubing and plumbing fittings. They grabbed a standard automotive pump and a water filter, and commandeered a rectangular baking pan from Mr. Martin’s kitchen.

“This was really fun,” Mr. Rollinger said. “It was like doing a science project in school.”

They devised a way to collect water droplets from an air-conditioner’s condensing coils. Normally that water drains onto the road beneath the car. In their system, the water is run through a filter and then stored in a reservoir.

Turn a switch inside the car, and a pump sends water from the reservoir up and out a spout mounted near the front console. The water arrives chilled because it condensed on the cool surfaces of the air-conditioner coils, Mr. Rollinger said.

The pair entered the prototype they built into Ford’s innovation contest last year, and it was selected as one of the winners. They have also applied for a patent.

For now, they are talking to suppliers and working on the business case for the idea. “I’m very hopeful of seeing it go into production,” Mr. Rollinger said.

Here’s a look at some other features that cars are starting to offer.

WI-FI HOT SPOT Most weekends, Jesse Chandler and his wife load their two daughters into their 2017 Audi Q5 and head for their vacation home in the mountains of North Carolina, a two-hour trek that is made easier by the car’s built-in internet connection.

“The kids have tablet and they watch videos on YouTube on all kinds of things,” said Dr. Chandler, an orthopedic surgeon in Greensboro, N.C. “That keeps them pretty occupied.”

Sometimes his wife, a pediatrician, connects to the internet to finish up medical reports. “If we leave on a Friday afternoon, she can bring her laptop and get her work done before,” he said.

Several other automakers also offer in-car Wi-Fi and internet connections. For the manufacturers, they are easy add-ons because most modern cars need communication abilities for their navigation systems. General Motors, for example, offers a high-speed 4G link, and many models come with a free three-month trial.

POWER GENERATOR Fuel-cell cars are now on sale in California. They generate electricity through a chemical process that turns hydrogen into water. In a pinch, they can be used as a backup power source.

The Toyota Mirai, for example, has an AC outlet in its trunk that can be used to run a refrigerator and other appliances in a blackout. G.M. recently built a three-ton fuel cell truck for the Army, and the power-generating capability is one of the main features.

“You have so much electricity production from hydrogen fuel cells that you could use it to power a field hospital, or power tools and provide power relief in a natural disaster,” said Charles Freese, executive director of G.M.’s Global Fuel Cell Business.

HOME REMOTE When cars connect to the internet, they can communicate with our homes while on the road. An app is now available with Tesla models to communicate with homes wired for remote control, for example. Drivers have the potential to turn up the heat, turn lights on or off, and check in with home security system.

In a similar vein, Ford is working with Amazon on integrating Alexa, the online retailer’s voice-activated assistant. That would also allow drivers to control a wired home from the car.

Empowering Girls Rescued From Child Marriage

The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.
“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.

Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

Photo

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

A Boom in Credit Cards: Great News for Banks, Less So Consumers

That is occurring at an opportune moment for the banking industry, which is suddenly struggling to earn as much money from traditional profit engines.

In the years since the financial crisis, the largest United States financial institutions churned out profits largely thanks to a booming business in trading and structuring bonds and other securities. Advising corporations and other institutions on their finances and strategies was another lucrative revenue stream.

Now, though, those businesses are flagging, in part because financial markets have been eerily calm.

So banks are turning more to lending to consumers — especially through credit cards — to pick up some of the slack.

Banks earn money from credit cards in two ways: They take a small cut of each card transaction as a fee, and they typically charge annual interest rates of 15 percent or more on balances that customers don’t pay off at the end of each month.

That business model is increasingly lucrative. Many consumers, their wages stagnant and their costs rising, are growing reliant on credit cards for essential goods and services, including medical and dental care. Across the industry, profits rose in the latest quarter.

At Bank of America, credit and debit card spending is up 7 percent this year compared with last. “Consumers are spending,” Brian T. Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call last week. The bank’s chief financial officer noted that the company’s cards business enjoyed better growth “than we’ve experienced in quite some time.”

Rivals are experiencing a similar surge. A strong consumer business, including card growth, helped JPMorgan increase its profits last quarter despite declines in traditional profit engines such as trading.

At Citigroup, an exclusive card deal with Costco — in which the bank provides branded credit cards to the discount-retail giant — has been “a real winner,” said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. He said customers were spending more on their Costco cards and rolling over larger balances.

Such surprisingly strong performances — the four leading banks raked in a total of $21 billion in profits during the third quarter — helped propel shares of banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America to their highest levels in years.

Spending on plastic is part of a broader debt bonanza. In May, total household debt levels hit a post-recession peak of $12.7 trillion.

Photo

The rising numbers reflect a growing economy and a robust financial system able to provide credit to people who need it, banking officials and analysts say.

“Delinquencies on credit cards have stayed remarkably low for five years. They’ve been well below their historical averages,” said James Chessen, the chief economist for the American Bankers Association. “We attribute that to consumers continuing to be very smart about how they use their cards, and very careful about how much debt they take.”

But what’s good for banks and their shareholders isn’t necessarily good for all bank customers.

Cynthia Regis, 73, worked for more than two decades as a home health care aide but has virtually no savings. To help pay her electric bill and to buy groceries, she racked up a balance of more than $6,000 on a Discover credit card. The annual interest rate is 29 percent, which makes it hard for her to whittle down her outstanding balance. One month this year, for example, her payment of $159 mostly covered her interest payments, shaving only $5 off her total debt.

“I’m barely making it,” Ms. Regis said.

Many Americans have seen their savings winnowed by a combination of the recession and stagnant wages. Almost half of adults said they could not pay for a $400 expense without selling something or borrowing money, the Federal Reserve has found. Some 44 percent of people with credit cards are currently carrying a balance, according to the American Bankers Association’s latest quarterly analysis, up 1.7 percentage points from the same period two years ago.

Older Americans, like Ms. Regis and Ms. Murray, living on a fixed income, are turning to credit cards to make ends meet, according to economists, lawyers and other experts.

“These cards are a social safety net,” said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan. He said he had seen thousands of clients made insolvent by a single unexpected cost.

For borrowers with shaky credit, interest rates can near 36 percent. Some borrowers end up owing more in interest than they originally spent on their cards.

Just making the minimum monthly payments on her cards costs Ms. Murray $500. That eats up more than half of what she receives from Social Security.

Photo

The cost to borrowers is creeping upward. The average interest rate on new credit card offers currently hovers at 16.15 percent, the highest level in at least a decade, according to data collected by CreditCards.com.

For banks, this is especially welcome because relatively few borrowers appear to be at risk of default. That means the banks pocket big fees and interest payments with minimal costs.

“A lot of the signs we look for in terms of the deterioration of the consumer, I’ve got to say, right now, we just don’t see,” Michael L. Corbat, Citigroup’s chief executive, told analysts last week. “We would rate the health of the consumer right now as pretty good.”

But a few small cracks are starting to show. Most of the major banks increased the amount of money they put aside to cover possible credit-card defaults in the most recent quarter. The recent spate of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, took a toll, and all of the banks expect to see their rate of defaulted loans rise in the coming months.

A recent analysis of Federal Reserve data by the debt-rating firm Moody’s found that working-class families, those with a median income of about $33,000, were starting to spend a higher portion of their income — slightly more than 15 percent — on debt payments, compared with what they spent three years earlier. As other expenses like health care and housing rise, more of those families are at risk of falling behind on their debts, it warned.

Pearline Rivers-Sobers got a credit card from Synchrony Financial at a local chiropractor when her late husband needed treatment that she couldn’t afford. The card later came in handy when her son needed glasses. Then she got another and another. Soon her wallet was stuffed with cards from CareCredit, Modell’s Sporting Goods, Linens ’n Things, Toys “R” Us, Sleepy’s and Old Navy. (Despite the logos they carry, those cards are also issued by banks.)

For a while, she kept up on payments, even managing to pay off two cards. But she has fallen behind on payments to at least five different banks, including Citigroup and Capital One.

“I was spending each month scrounging together money that basically did not even pay the interest,” Ms. Rivers-Sobers said.

Now, she said, she is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The banks that issued her the cards are likely to receive a fraction of what she owes them.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

Harsh Words Back Home for Tom Marino, Congressman Tied to Opioid Law

“His hand got caught in the cookie jar,” Robert Gibbs, a retired shipping clerk and a Democrat, said of Mr. Marino.
Mr. Yaw sponsored a bill in Harrisburg, the state capital, to restrict how many pain pills doctors can prescribe at once.
Mr. Marino, a former county and federal prosecutor, who was one of Mr. Trump’s earliest supporters in Pennsylvania, won his race last year in a landslide.
He noted Mr. Marino first won his seat in 2010 even after resigning as a United States attorney under the cloud of a Justice Department investigation.
William Carlucci, 62, a lawyer in Williamsport, predicted that Mr. Marino would win easily if he ran.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Since the president pledged in August to declare the opioid crisis a national emergency, he has been criticized for not following through. He added on Monday that he planned to make a “major announcement” on the subject next week.

In Williamsport, reactions were almost universally harsh.

“His hand got caught in the cookie jar,” Robert Gibbs, a retired shipping clerk and a Democrat, said of Mr. Marino.

Residents described how drugs had changed the city. Local hospitals treated 51 overdoses in a 48-hour period in June. A juror on a smoking break outside the county courthouse called Williamsport “little Philadelphia” because of its drug problem. Adrienna Snyder, a postal worker, said businesses on her downtown route now lock their restrooms to keep people from dying in them.

State Senator Gene Yaw, a Republican from Williamsport, who has been a leader in the Legislature on opioid issues, said the strong Republican lean of Mr. Marino’s 10th District might not be enough to ensure his re-election if he seeks a fifth term next year.

“The drug problem is nonpartisan,” Mr. Yaw said. “There’s no question the pharmaceutical companies have contributed to it.’’ He said the controversy over Mr. Marino’s withdrawal from consideration to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy was “not a plus” for his political future.

Mr. Yaw sponsored a bill in Harrisburg, the state capital, to restrict how many pain pills doctors can prescribe at once. It is meant to limit the amount of opioids in circulation — the opposite of what critics say is the effect of the legislation Mr. Marino promoted in Congress, known as the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act.

Mr. Marino issued a statement on Tuesday expressing pride in the 2016 law, which passed by acclamation in the House and Senate and was signed by President Barack Obama.

He criticized the news media for distorting the bill, which he called “landmark legislation” that balances the needs of patients for pain medicine with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s powers to stop abuse.

On Sunday, a joint investigation by The Washington Post and “60 Minutes” revealed how the drug industry had worked behind the scenes with Mr. Marino on the law, helping to draft its language, hiring former D.E.A. lawyers as consultants and showering $1.5 million in donations to Congress.

The law weakened the D.E.A.’s power to stop prescription opioids from being shipped to rogue doctors and pharmacies suspected of corruptly distributing them. A flood of narcotics to “pill mills” has been a major cause of the opioid crisis. Many people who became addicted to prescription pills have turned to heroin since the authorities began tightening access to legal opioids.

On “60 Minutes,” a former top D.E.A. enforcement official, Joseph T. Rannazzisi, said, “I just don’t understand why Congress would pass a bill that strips us of our authority in the height of an opioid epidemic in places like Congressman Marino’s district.”

In his statement, Mr. Marino referred to Mr. Rannazzisi as “the subject of a professional conduct investigation” whose “assertions may be motivated by financial self-interest.”

Mr. Marino’s largely rural district, which stretches in a northern arc from the Susquehanna Valley to the Delaware Water Gap, on the New Jersey border, has been drawn to favor Republicans. Mr. Marino, a former county and federal prosecutor, who was one of Mr. Trump’s earliest supporters in Pennsylvania, won his race last year in a landslide.

A Democratic opponent, Judy Herschel, who is a drug and alcohol abuse counselor, has announced a challenge in the district next year, and the contrast ads over opioids seem inevitable.

Still, Michael Allison, a political scientist at the University of Scranton, said it was too early to know if Mr. Marino’s re-election prospects would suffer. He noted Mr. Marino first won his seat in 2010 even after resigning as a United States attorney under the cloud of a Justice Department investigation. Federal agents were looking into his role in helping to win a casino license for an accused mobster.

William Carlucci, 62, a lawyer in Williamsport, predicted that Mr. Marino would win easily if he ran. “I think he’s well liked,” he said.

Mr. Carlucci, who does commercial litigation, was conferring on the courthouse steps with his adversary in a case, Megan Wells.

Ms. Wells, 30, described Mr. Marino’s role in the controversial legislation as a case of “the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Her law firm represents the interests of a neighboring county in cases in which children are removed from the custody of parents with drug addictions. “We are seeing an astounding number of grandparents stepping in to take custody,” she said. “Things are worse now than they’ve been. It’s just so pervasive.”

When archaeologists started excavating shortly thereafter, they found a plaster floor of a palace near the huge wine storeroom.
“It is like eating shawarma and pita, but a little more elegant,” Dr. Cline said.
Intact pits indicate olives used for eating, while broken pits from heavy stone mills were used to make oil.
“By working together, we are finding bits of information to understand the economy of Kabri and what happened here,” Dr. Cline said.
“We know that, because of new technology, techniques and interpretations, we or others will do it better in the future,” Dr. Cline said.

Tel Kabri was found by accident, like many archaeological sites, in the 1960s when workmen were digging ditches for water pipes connecting springs in the north to Nahariya and Akko. When archaeologists started excavating shortly thereafter, they found a plaster floor of a palace near the huge wine storeroom. Less than 10 percent of the site has been explored so far.

From pottery found through the years, the archaeologists know that the inhabitants of the palace drank their wine from a ceramic cup, unique to the site, today called the Kabri goblet. Among the artifacts there were clues to the sea and land travel of the inhabitants, including a local imitation of a scarab from Egypt and potsherds from Greece.

As the volunteers tap with picks, fragments are given to archaeologists to determine if they are bone, ceramic or an artifact. Animal bones reveal much about who was eating there. The front left parts of the animals were considered the choicest for eating, while the right front parts were for sacrifice to the gods. A found piece of bone from an aurochs, an extinct cow that was typically seven feet tall and weighed one ton, provided insight into the scale of ancient banquets.

“If you figure half a pound of meat a person, one aurochs could feed 1,000 people,” said Assaf Yasur-Landau, co-director of the project and a professor of archaeology at the University of Haifa. “The meal could have been for the heads of households of a city state.“

Since they had no utensils with which to eat, the meat was boiled or roasted, scooped up with flatbread and washed down with wine. “It is like eating shawarma and pita, but a little more elegant,” Dr. Cline said.

The size of the ancient rooms is also revealing. A 30-foot-square space could accommodate 100 people standing or sitting on stools and footstools at receptions where nuts and olives were probably served. Olive pits, intact or broken, are often found at the site. Intact pits indicate olives used for eating, while broken pits from heavy stone mills were used to make oil.

“By working together, we are finding bits of information to understand the economy of Kabri and what happened here,” Dr. Cline said. “And we are trying to find out what catastrophe destroyed this place — was it too much or too little water, an earthquake, disease, abandonment or something else?”

As the team carefully sieve through the layers of ancient terroir, they never excavate an entire site, leaving a part of it for future generations.

“We know that, because of new technology, techniques and interpretations, we or others will do it better in the future,” Dr. Cline said. Then he paused. “We live for these summers. They are a great escape from the real world.”

Kelly Delivers Fervent Defense of Trump Call to Soldier’s Widow

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
“Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud,” Mr. Kelly told an unusually hushed room filled with reporters.
“The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.
The movie, which recounted the return of the Marine’s remains, “is worth seeing,” Mr. Kelly said.
“When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country,” Mr. Kelly said.
“We don’t look down upon those of you who haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said before concluding his remarks.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Late Thursday night, Mr. Trump assailed Ms. Wilson in a tweet, accusing her of listening “SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!”

Mr. Kelly struck a tone that was more even, if just as powerful. He displayed scorn for a society that he said does not appreciate the sacrifice of those in the military. “Most of you as Americans don’t know them,” he said, bemoaning that “there’s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate but required.”

A retired Marine general whose son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was slain in battle in 2010, Mr. Kelly has long guarded his personal story of loss even as he served as a high-profile public official. He broke that silence in dramatic fashion on Thursday, offering — from his personal and professional experience — a detailed, even excruciating description of what happens to the remains of those killed in combat, and how the grieving families back home are notified.

“Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud,” Mr. Kelly told an unusually hushed room filled with reporters. “They’re packed in ice, typically at the air head, and then they’re flown to — usually Europe, where they’re then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the medals that they’ve earned, the emblems of their service.”

He testified to the deep pain that parents feel when they get an early-morning knock on the door from an official to tell them that their son or daughter has been killed in action. “The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

And he described the moment that he got the knock on his own door: A military official telling him that his son “was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed,” Mr. Kelly recalled. “He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we were at war.”

Mr. Kelly also revealed, apparently for the first time, that he was standing next to Pfc. Chance Phelps, the subject of the HBO movie “Taking Chance,” as the Marine private was killed by hostile fire in Anbar Province in Iraq. The movie, which recounted the return of the Marine’s remains, “is worth seeing,” Mr. Kelly said.

Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Kelly’s blunt remarks will have impact because of the stark contrast with an administration that has repeatedly lost credibility with the public.

“Its great power was you knew he was telling the truth, and in all specifics,” said Ms. Noonan, a Wall Street Journal columnist. “Kelly comes to the podium and it was credible, and you felt a kind of relief, and respect and gratitude.”

The surprise appearance by Mr. Kelly came after Mr. Trump and the White House were defensively consumed by the president’s actions this week — first, appearing to criticize former presidents for failing to call the families of fallen service members, and later for the words Mr. Trump chose to use in speaking with Sergeant Johnson’s widow.

Their conversation was first revealed by Ms. Wilson, who quoted Mr. Trump as saying that Sergeant Johnson “knew what he signed up for.” The congresswoman told reporters that she and the Johnson family were offended by the president’s bluntness.

Mr. Kelly’s initial grief on Thursday quickly gave way to an anger that was fueled by what he said was an unfair attack on his boss.

He said Mr. Trump was merely trying to express what Mr. Kelly had discussed with the president before the phone call — that soldiers like Sergeant Johnson were doing what they loved, and what they had chosen to do, when they were killed serving the country.

“That’s what the president tried to say to four families,” Mr. Kelly said. He later appeared to attack Ms. Wilson by noting that, during an emotional 2015 ceremony, a congresswoman had crassly claimed political credit for getting funding for an F.B.I. building in Miami that was named for fallen agents. Ms. Wilson’s congressional district includes parts of Miami.

“And we were stunned — stunned that she’d done it,” Mr. Kelly recalled, though he did not name Ms. Wilson. “Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ms. Wilson’s office declined to respond. The congresswoman also had pushed legislation to quickly name the F.B.I. building.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had not intended to suggest during an impromptu White House news conference on Monday that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had not done enough to honor the fallen. Mr. Trump’s words incensed former Obama administration officials.

Mr. Kelly said that he had advised Mr. Trump that presidents generally do not directly call family members of slain service members, and he confirmed that Mr. Obama had not called him when Lieutenant Kelly was killed — as Mr. Trump had alluded to this week.

“That was not a criticism; that was just to simply say, ‘I don’t believe President Obama called,’” Mr. Kelly said. He said that Lieutenant Kelly’s friends in Afghanistan called him in the hours after his son died, and noted that presidents often write condolence letters to grieving military families instead of calling.

“Those are the only phone calls that really mattered,” Mr. Kelly said, his voice cracking. “And yeah, the letters count, to a degree. But there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.”

Mr. Kelly said that he sought refuge during his trip to the national cemetery, surrounded by the gravestones of service members, some of whom “I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.” Mr. Kelly commanded Marines in Iraq in 2008, one of the bloodiest years of the American-led war there.

But even if he found solace at Arlington National Cemetery, he clearly remained angry on Thursday as he addressed reporters. At one point, he would take questions from anyone who is “a Gold Star parent or sibling.” At another, he described the United States as a place that regularly breaches the sacred trusts that had once underpinned a polite society.

“When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country,” Mr. Kelly said. “Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life, the dignity of life, is sacred. That’s gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.”

Mr. Kelly did not explain his critique or say whether he was referring to Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who embraced politics by speaking on behalf of Hillary Clinton last year at the Democratic National Convention.

Nor did he acknowledge the irony in his comments. Many people accused Mr. Trump of failing to respect Gold Star families by attacking Mr. Khan. And Mr. Trump’s behavior toward women in an “Access Hollywood” tape was seen by many as a failure to respect women.

Instead, Mr. Kelly said that he was “sorry” that most Americans are unfamiliar with the young people who fight in the military on behalf of a country that, in his view, takes them for granted.

“We don’t look down upon those of you who haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said before concluding his remarks. “In fact, in a way, we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our servicemen and women do. Not for any other reason than they love this country.”

“So just think of that,” he said. “And I do appreciate your time.”

“Why not?” I remember him asking. “Because I don’t like vodka, and I don’t like diet soda, and I don’t like them together,” I said. “You are going to drink that,” he insisted. I smiled again and said that I wouldn’t. He gave up and called me stubborn. I said, “I know.” And the meal proceeded without much further ado. In this second encounter with Harvey, I found him to be pushy and idiosyncratic more than anything.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.

Tarantino on Weinstein: ‘I Knew Enough to Do More Than I Did’
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said.
Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology.
Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.
But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply.
Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he recalled, saying he wrote them off as mild misbehavior. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

In the hourlong conversation, Mr. Tarantino, 54, apologized for not doing more while also explaining why; admitted his own culpability while also calling for sweeping change in Hollywood’s treatment of women; and condemned Mr. Weinstein, 65, while acknowledging their father-son closeness.

The producer and director have been symbiotic for decades: from 1992, when Mr. Weinstein distributed “Reservoir Dogs,” through “Pulp Fiction,” the “Kill Bill” films, “Inglourious Basterds” and “The Hateful Eight,” until a few weeks ago, when he threw Mr. Tarantino an engagement party.

When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said. But some of the accounts were deeply familiar to him. “Everyone who was close to Harvey had heard of at least one of those incidents” chronicled in the first few articles, he said. “It was impossible they didn’t.”

The Weinstein Investigation

When he and Ms. Sorvino started dating in 1995, she told him that not long before, Mr. Weinstein had massaged her without asking, chased her around a hotel room and even showed up at her apartment in the middle of the night, a story she recently shared with The New Yorker.

“I was shocked and appalled” back then, Mr. Tarantino said. “I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira.” She had won accolades for her performance in “Mighty Aphrodite,” and “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way,” Mr. Tarantino said. “Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

The problem was resolved, he said he felt at the time, because he and Ms. Sorvino were dating. “I’m with her, he knows that, he won’t mess with her, he knows that she’s my girlfriend,” Mr. Tarantino said, describing his attitude back then.

Over the years, he learned of other accounts. Another actress friend told him a troubling story of unwanted advances by Mr. Weinstein in a hotel room. Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology. (She confirmed the account to The Times but declined to be identified.)

Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. Recently, she tweeted that Mr. Weinstein had raped her.

Mr. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex made by Ms. McGowan and others.

There were rumors too, shadowy accounts that Mr. Tarantino continued to hear second- or thirdhand and never pursued further. Now Mr. Tarantino said he regretted not taking the women’s stories seriously enough. “I chalked it up to a ’50s-’60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s O.K. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

In the interview, Mr. Tarantino issued several calls to action. In its treatment of women, Hollywood has been “operating under an almost Jim Crow-like system that us males have almost tolerated,” he said. “We allowed it to exist because that’s the way it was.”

On the discussion of who knew what about Mr. Weinstein and when, he said: “I’m calling on the other guys who knew more to not be scared. Don’t just give out statements. Acknowledge that there was something rotten in Denmark. Vow to do better by our sisters.”

He added, “What was previously accepted is now untenable to anyone of a certain consciousness.”

His own relationship with Mr. Weinstein, who has been fired from his own company and ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, spanned deals and shoots, publicity tours and film festivals. But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply. Mr. Weinstein needs to “face the music,” he said.

Despite their closeness, he said he could offer no insight into Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misdeeds. “I don’t have an answer for why he could do this and be stripped of his entire legacy,” he said.

Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused. “I don’t know,” he said. “I hope it doesn’t.”

And talking on the phone meant I didn’t have to hide it when I got bored. And oh boy, did I get bored. Each Talk interview lasts at least an hour, which produces anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 words of transcript, and we only need about 800 of those words in the finished product.

Being a good interviewer takes skill, just not the skill most people assume: You don’t have to be able to ask or come up with great questions. You need patience and humility. The more focus you put on asking a great question, the more it’s about you, and that shows. An interviewee can tell, and it detracts from that gentle magic that focused curiosity can work.

When the magic worked, it could yield delightful surprises: Mary Karr talking to me about not wanting to talk about David Foster Wallace’s penis. DJ Khaled admitting that he, just like all humans, was scared to be around Beyoncé, despite being on tour with her. Rashida Jones sharing her first experience with porn.

Of course, ginning up such a high level of intimacy and trust with a stranger could get weird. I cried with several interviewees. Two wanted to hear, off the record, about my experience getting sober. I got asked out once — very politely and respectfully, and with flattering, wistful chagrin when I said I was married. A handful of genuinely famous people told me to “stay in touch,” and I think a few of them even meant it. Dan Rather told me I should call my father and tell him I love him (which I immediately did). DJ Khaled gave me his cellphone number and offered to give me a pep talk whenever I needed it, a favor I am saving for some particularly dark night of the soul.

It’s also true that genuine curiosity cannot make a person reflect if he or she does not want to be reflective, and those were the slowest hours of my life … not that I would want any of them back. Not a single person failed to deliver 800 words that felt fresh, a fact I take some comfort in. We can all be interesting for a page.

Goodbyes were almost always awkward. A publicist might butt in, or another appointment might create a terse “hard out,” or maybe I just realized that we were in the area of diminishing returns (and too much transcript to wade through) … none of these are natural end points, especially if the conversation had started to feel like a real one. For a while, I struggled with how to wrap up in a way that was professional but that acknowledged our fleeting familiarity. “I hope our paths cross again” is what I settled on: closing the door on our relationship but not slamming it shut.

It’s been a pleasure spending Sundays with you, and I hope our paths cross again.

Senate Approves Budget Plan That Smooths Path Toward Tax Cut

“This is the last, best chance we will have to cut taxes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Budget Committee, who warned that the consequences would be ruinous if the party failed.

“That will be the end of us as a party,” he said, “because if you’re a Republican and you don’t want to simplify the tax code and cut taxes, what good are you to anybody?”

Mr. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 1 a.m. to congratulate the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell — whose tensions with the president have been well-documented — for a “first step toward delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for the American people!”

Others were quick to condemn the blueprint. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, declared the budget to be “extremely cruel,” and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said it would burden the middle class.

“This nasty and backwards budget green-lights cuts to Medicare and Medicaid in order to give a tax break to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans,” Mr. Schumer said.

The Senate approved the budget blueprint after considering a flurry of amendments, a tedious process that gives the minority party an opportunity to force the majority to endure politically difficult votes. One Democratic amendment that was rejected sought to stop tax cuts from going to the top 1 percent; another would have restored cuts to Medicare.

The Senate approved the budget after a so-called vote-a-rama, a legislative whirlwind in which amendments are considered one after another. One proposal would have deleted language that could allow for drilling legislation; the amendment failed, 48 to 52.

“The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine areas of the United States, and we have been protecting it for decades for a reason,” said Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

But Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska and the chairwoman of the energy panel, said erasing the language would “deprive us of a substantial opportunity to benefit our country at the same time that we care for our environment.”

In Congress, the annual budget resolution provides an outline of federal spending and revenues. The Senate’s blueprint, for the 2018 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, claims to achieve a balanced budget within a decade, assuming greater economic growth and using an accounting method that excludes Social Security. In order to erase projected deficits, it calls for trillions of dollars in spending cuts over the coming decade.

But the cuts exist only on paper, without legislation to achieve them.

Even so, Democrats sounded the alarm, warning that the aspirational cuts in the budget plan called for slicing more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and about $470 billion from Medicare over a decade.

They also lamented the approach that Republicans are taking on taxes, which mirrors the strategy that they employed in their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On that matter, Republicans successfully laid the groundwork for a repeal measure that could pass without any Democratic votes, but party leaders could not ultimately get 50 Republican senators to agree on a health bill.

Though Democrats have pleaded to have more say in the tax overhaul, parliamentary language in the budget resolution would allow Republicans to pass a tax bill without any cooperation from the minority party. The tax measure could add as much as $1.5 trillion to budget deficits over a decade.

“Passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan. “Passing this budget is only a requirement to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible, without input or buy-in from members of the minority.”

For Republicans, the budget debate provided a moment to showcase their main goal in the coming months: Approving an overhaul of the tax code for the first time in decades, which they hope will lead to greater economic growth.

The House approved its budget resolution, which had long been stalled, on Oct. 5. The House budget also lays the groundwork for a tax bill, but, unlike the Senate’s approach, it calls for the legislation to not add to the deficit.

The House budget resolution also seeks more concrete action when it comes to cutting spending, instructing committees to come up with legislation that would produce at least about $200 billion in savings.

The chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, had seemed reluctant to jettison that piece of the blueprint. “What part of ‘cut spending’ does @SenateGOP not understand?” she wrote on Twitter last week. But Senate Republicans have shown no appetite to make spending cuts in tandem with the tax overhaul.

As the brilliant Spanish philosopher Javier Gomá Lanzón reminds us, most moral education happens by power of example. We publish the book of our lives every day through our actions, and through our conduct we teach one another what is worthy of admiration and what is worthy of disdain.

Public figures are the primary teachers in this mutual education. Our leaders have outsize influence in either weaving the moral order by their good example or ripping it to shreds by their bad example.

McCain’s career has had its low moments, as all of ours do — a banking scandal, Sarah Palin — but he exemplifies a practical standard of excellence to an extraordinary degree: enduring in Vietnam, seeking compromise legislation on everything from immigration reform to campaign spending, condemning torture after 9/11.

Moreover, I don’t think there’s another politician now living who devotes so much of his speeches to little biographies of his own exemplars, people like James Stockdale, Bud Day, Morris Udall and Master Sgt. Roy Benavidez. He has turned his own heroes into educational resources for his country, and used them to evangelize our national ideals.

These sorts of testimonies help weave a shared moral order, which is necessary to unite, guide and motivate a diverse country.

That is an essential bulwark in the age of Trump. That is what needs rebuilding. Books will someday be written on how Trump, this wounded and twisted man, became morally acceptable to tens of millions of Americans. But it must have something to do with the way over the past decades we have divorced private and public morality, as if private narcissism would have no effect on public conduct.

It must have something to do with the great tide of moral libertarianism from Herbert Marcuse on down. This tide taught that progress meant emancipating the individual from shared moral orders. It taught transgression was always delightful and that morality was individual and optional.

The acceptability of Trump must also have something to do with millions of religious voters being willing to abandon the practical wisdom of their faiths — that what exists inside a person is more important than what is external, that no bad tree yields good fruit, that you should never trade spiritual humility for worldly ferocity because in humility there is strength and in pride there is self-destruction.

We’ve reached a point in which the tasks of paideia have been abandoned and neglected. “One could say,” Gomá writes in his book “Public Exemplarity,” “that we are looking for the ideal of a virtuous republic composed of citizens relieved of the burden of citizenship.”

It’s not working out. Gomá continues, “In a time of freedom such as ours marked by subjectivism and vulgarity, a tolerance not tempered by virtue will lead inevitably toward barbarism.”

Barbarism and vulgarity we have in profusion. Through his daily utterances, Trump is influencing the nation in powerful ways, but none would call it paideia. Few would say he is spreading a contagion that we’d like our children to catch.

The moral fabric of society is invisible but essential. Some use their public position to dissolve it so they can have an open space for their selfishness. McCain is one of the strongest reweavers we have, and one of our best and most stubborn teachers.

Tricky Clues

1A: When you hear the word “place,” you’re thinking of an external locale, aren’t you? So, “Place where analysis is done?” doesn’t lead you immediately to LEFT BRAIN. But it’s true. The right hemisphere of the brain is the more creative side.

15A: I remember the television show UGLY BETTY, but did not know that it was based on a Colombian telenovela.

16A: A biblical quote from HOSEA: “They have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.”

22A: Don’t be fooled by that capitalized C in China. “China assembly” is not something made in China. It’s a TEA SET, which can be made of china.

40A: Isn’t it wonderful how words can mean different things to different age groups? To someone just out of college, a “Senior moment?” is a PROM. That’s nice, Mr. Ezersky. Give it a couple of decades and then we’ll ask you to clue that one again. Bet you come up with a whole new ... oh, what was that word? It was right on the tip of my tongue.

62A: How did it take this long for someone to debut the CHOCO TACO in the crossword?

64A: Super model TYRA BANKS popularized the term “smize,” which is smiling with your eyes, or so I’m told. It’s not as easy as, say, simultaneously rubbing your belly and patting your head, but you can learn to do it, too:

1D: A “Spin out on the ice?” sounds dangerous, like a car gone out of control. Today, however, it refers to the LUTZ, a figure skating movement.

11D: Clues like this are when my brain shuts down, but yay, math. “What turns 1,000 into 3, in base 10” is a LOGARITHM.

12D: Much more my speed. Have some Pink Floyd:

34D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. How long did it take you to get ATTIC DOOR for “One way to the top”?

54D: “It’s just in your head” for IDEA is runner-up for Clue of the Day for me.

Constructor Notes

While it may not necessarily be my magnum opus, this is my favorite puzzle I’ve ever created. That’s because the puzzle is me*. I’ll shamelessly admit that I’ve listened to “TRAP QUEEN” at least 1,738 times. I’m equally obsessed with Pink Floyd, and “US AND THEM” is a classic. I graduated from U.V.A.’s engineering school this past May, though I was an ECON MAJOR as well. CHOCO TACO as a crossword entry feels animated yet quirky, and that about sums me up. LEFT BRAIN? My right brain doesn’t exist. LOGARITHM? I’m a numbers guy. ATTIC DOOR? Eh, I’m weird and have my flaws, I suppose. I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed making this thing, but like talking about myself, it just feels awkward. I guess it’s worth noting that on top of everything else, this is my first true crossword publication since I became the Times’ new assistant puzzles editor! Thanks to Will for letting me edit this with him, to Joel for checking this out over a text conversation two years ago, to you solvers for dealing with me in grid form ... and to just everybody in general for giving me a shot. *With the exception of EGOMANIAC, I hope! Also, I prefer a mojito to a PIÑA COLADA any day.

Thank you, Mr. Ezersky. That was an eye-opener.

GroupMe, it should be said, is a text client like WhatsApp that allows a user to be added to multiple group chats that vary in size from two to 200 members. A group chat over text message requires personal phone numbers or email addresses, but GroupMe is much easier: You can join or be added to different chats using a public Facebook or Google account.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many. Online or real world: It’s all the same.

Australia’s Amazon Book Battle

Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia’s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.
The rules essentially give Australian publishers a national monopoly over any book they publish.
PhotoWould Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion?
Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers.
But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
You know all those bespoke experiences that American urbanites have been reviving: the artisanal butcher and barber shops, the gourmet grocer and the community bookstore? In Australia, though weakened by shopping centers, they never really died.

This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.

Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia’s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.

Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they’ll eventually embrace and come to love.

Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon’s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia’s own writing, and way of life.

“Our culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,” Mr. Rubbo said. “We’re fighting to defend our voice.”

What Do You Want and When Do You Want It?

Amazon’s first “fulfillment center” in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.

Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia’s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.

What comes next is anyone’s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.

The company is known for this sort of thing, preferring buzz to transparency, and here in Australia, that’s led to excitement for many who are hoping for an easier, much broader online shopping experience — along with real estate speculation in the warehouse market, the rollout of a new free delivery service by Australia’s postal service, and what the chief executive at one large retailing conglomerate described as “a healthy sense of paranoia.”

Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn’t explained why it’s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon’s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.

There are other digital booksellers already in Australia too, including Book Depository, an Amazon subsidiary from Britain, and Booktopia, a start-up that nearly went public last year.

Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia’s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.

Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers’ hands, in some cases on the same day they’re ordered.

“It’s not about price,” Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, “it’s about the logistics.”

But isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.

Sean Guy, a manager at The Bookshop in Darwin, Australia’s northernmost major city, said if he lived in a more isolated community like Alice Springs, in the nation’s interior desert region, “I’d probably find it a lot easier to go online for five minutes than call the local bookshop.”

For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.

“You’ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,” he said. “And people like supporting local businesses.”

Australians already buy more books per capita than Americans (based on Nielsen sales figures) and spend more hours reading.

Michael Heyward, the publisher at Text, an independent publisher with a mix of new and established Australian writers, including Helen Garner, said that maybe Australia’s built up enough independence to live with Amazon in peace.

“I would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,” he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.

But just below his own bookish calm — and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books — there are wider concerns.

“Let’s not outsource our minds to the narcissism of the global algorithm,” warned Anna Funder, the author of “Stasiland” and “All That I Am,” at a booksellers conference last year. And she’s not alone.

“People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce,” said Tim Winton, the author of Australian classics like “Cloudstreet,” and one of Australia’s best-known writers. “When you take away their role as agents of culture and reduce them to instruments of capitalism, it changes the dynamic.”

In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.

One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia’s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers’ orders at the end of the line.

“Amazon controls the negotiating process,” said David Gaunt, the co-owner of Gleebooks in Sydney. “If they choose to sell the new Richard Flanagan book at $9.99,” he added, referring to Australia’s last winner of the Man Booker Prize, who has a new novel out, “we’ll sell none.”

The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia’s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.

Stock grants for employees could be used to decrease tax liability, as Amazon has done in Europe. What else Amazon might do is a question lawyers and consultants are already gaming out, while lobbying the Australian government, which at this point seems determined to protect its own.

Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.

Australian lawmakers have also resisted calls from economists on the government’s own Productivity Commission to eliminate the country’s parallel import restrictions. The rules essentially give Australian publishers a national monopoly over any book they publish. Booksellers are not allowed to import books from another country if the book has been published by an Australian copyright holder within 30 days of overseas release and if the Australian publisher can supply the book within 90 days.

Critics say the rules are protectionist, and a cause of overpriced books.

But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia’s literary culture.

The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.

Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.

“What makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,” said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: “It’s a retrograde move.”

Price vs. Personal Interaction

Inside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.

At Riverbend Books in Brisbane, another independent bookseller well known to publishers and authors, roughly 60 percent of the books are written by Australians.

Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?

“We have a lot of questions,” said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.

He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.

The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia’s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.

Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. “I like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn’t find otherwise,” said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.

Authors are even more zealous. “If literature is a religion, the bookstore is the church,” said Alec Patric, an award-winning novelist who also happens to work at Readings. “It’s a delicate equilibrium.”

Amazon’s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.

Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. “They were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,” she said.

But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: “We welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators’ rights.”

Ms. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon’s power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods.

“It’s really crucial that these places survive and thrive,” Ms. Wilson said. “I wish I was more optimistic.”

By the end of this year, San Francisco is expected to finish converting roughly 18,500 of its sodium high-pressured streetlights to dark sky-compliant LED bulbs.

People can expect to see a noticeable difference, including more visible stars in the night sky, said Tyler Gamble, a spokesman with the city’s public utilities commission.

Los Angeles has also embraced LEDs in its streetlights, though the city chose a bulb with a bluish cast that critics say has only worsened the light pollution.

Dark sky groups recommend “warmer” LED bulbs with an amber glow. They also push the use of dimmers, motion sensors and timers wherever they make sense.

Softer lighting has been promoted in part on health grounds.

Research has shown that high-intensity lights at night actually do harm by suppressing hormones that help people fall asleep.

Mr. Murali, the photographer, said too many city dwellers seem to be unaware of what they miss in the absence of a truly starry sky. “We are always lost in our busy lives,” he said.

As a reminder, one might consider a trip to a place like Death Valley National Park.

“It’s really incredible,” he said. “You really feel as if you’re just walking on Mars.”

And Finally ...

In the charred rubble of Santa Rosa it was the McDonald’s that drew Penny Wolin, a photographer who lives nearby.

Touring the destruction last week, she said she was stunned by the amount of destruction. “I had to really calm down,” she said.

She arrived at a shopping complex on the western edge of the 101 Freeway, which the Tubbs Fire had leapt in its sprint into the Coffey Park neighborhood.

A Kmart and an Americas Best Value Inn had been incinerated. So had the McDonald’s, yet some of the restaurant’s cheery exterior remained intact.

“It’s still looking sort of normal, like ‘Come on in,’” said Ms. Wolin, 64. “But in fact the plastic is melted on the post and the arches had fallen to the ground and the ‘McDonald’s’ is so burned it’s almost a black-and-white photograph.”

She continued, “I’ll tell you, that, for me, tells the whole thing and points the way to our larger American society for the moment.”

Ms. Wolin shared a collection of her images. It’s called “Good Morning McDonald’s.”

WASHINGTON — Let’s just get this out of the way: There are other matters of consequence going on in the world.

But in these fractious times, a series of puppy photos sent by none other than the fun-loving scamps at the Central Intelligence Agency qualifies as a feel-good, stick-it-to-the-man moment, shared by thousands of people who are marooned in office jobs. Meet Lulu, the black Labrador retriever and free spirit who bucked expectations and flunked out of the C.I.A.’s explosive detection “puppy class.”

Maybe it was her shiny coat that made Lulu’s story ricochet around the internet. Maybe it was her soft brown eyes. Or maybe her story just sounds familiar to any American who has experienced workplace ennui: She underwent rigorous training for a daily grind job and decided that sniffing out bombs was not her calling. (And who actually wants that job, anyway?)

The photos were a rare attempt at a cutesy moment from a secretive agency better known for much darker stories. The number of C.I.A. personnel killed in Afghanistan now rivals the number of agency operatives who died in the wars in Vietnam and Laos decades ago. The agency has pushed for extended powers to carry out covert drone strikes in active war zones. So even the course load for its bomb dogs is high-stakes and rigorous.

“A few weeks into training, Lulu began to show signs that she wasn’t interested in detecting explosive odors,” read a statement on the C.I.A. website. “Usually it lasts for a day, maybe two.”

Trump, Trade and Tantrums

In 1994, when the agreement went into effect, many people hoped that it would jump-start rapid growth in the Mexican economy; it didn’t. Some proponents also argued that the United States would run large surpluses in its trade with Mexico; in fact, after its 1995 financial crisis Mexico began running surpluses instead.

Photo

Furthermore, growing trade definitely hurt some U.S. workers. Some U.S. companies laid off workers and moved production to Mexico (although others added jobs to produce goods for Mexican markets, or gained a competitive advantage from the ability to purchase components from Mexican suppliers).

By any measure, the costs inflicted by Nafta were far smaller than those created by imports from China — and these in turn were far smaller than those created by changing technology. For example, the decline in coal-mining employment — caused almost entirely by technological change — or the collapse in truckers’ wages — reflecting deregulation and the collapse of union power — had nothing to do with Nafta. Still, the trade deal caused some real pain.

But admitting this unpleasant reality has almost no bearing on the question of what to do now. Nafta’s disruptions are mostly in the rearview mirror.

We now live in a North American economy built around the reality of free trade. In particular, U.S., Canadian and Mexican manufacturing are deeply enmeshed with one another. Many industrial plants were built precisely to take advantage of our economic integration, buying from or selling to other industrial plants across the borders.

As a result, breaking up or degrading Nafta would have the same disruptive effects that came from Nafta’s creation: Plants would close, jobs would disappear, communities would lose their livelihoods. And, yes, many businesses, small, large and in some cases huge, would lose many billions of dollars.

Oh, and it’s not just manufacturing. What do you think would happen to the farmers of Iowa if they lost one of the most important markets for their corn?

So what I and others have been assuming is that these realities would stay Trump’s hand. No matter how ignorant he may be about the realities of North American trade, we assumed that he would in the end balk at alienating big businesses and big money.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But now I’m not so sure.

For one thing, Nafta negotiations are going very badly. America’s demands — requiring renewal every five years, taking away the ability of businesses to appeal government actions — would undermine the predictability, the assurance of future market access, that was the trade agreement’s main point.

Meanwhile, documents leaked to The Washington Post show key administration advisers attributing virtually every social ill, from spousal abuse to divorce, to the loss of manufacturing jobs — and we know that the administration, wrongly, believes that trade treaties are the cause of those job losses.

Most important, look at what Trump has been doing with his open, indeed gleeful sabotage of the U.S. health care system. Never mind the huge human costs he’s imposing; he isn’t even following any plausible political strategy, since he and his party are likely, with good reason, to be blamed for the damage. Furthermore, his actions will cost big businesses — insurers and health providers — billions; he’s even boasting about how much he has hurt their stock prices.

So we’ve now seen Trump deliberately hurt millions of people and inflict billions of losses on a major industry out of sheer spite. If he’s willing to do that on health care, why assume he won’t do the same thing on international trade policy?

Nafta, then, is at real risk. And if it does get destroyed, the only question is whether the consequences will be ugly, or extremely ugly.

A Boom in Credit Cards: Great News for Banks, Less So Consumers

That is occurring at an opportune moment for the banking industry, which is suddenly struggling to earn as much money from traditional profit engines.

In the years since the financial crisis, the largest United States financial institutions churned out profits largely thanks to a booming business in trading and structuring bonds and other securities. Advising corporations and other institutions on their finances and strategies was another lucrative revenue stream.

Photo

Now, though, those businesses are flagging, in part because financial markets have been eerily calm.

So banks are turning more to lending to consumers — especially through credit cards — to pick up some of the slack.

Banks earn money from credit cards in two ways: They take a small cut of each card transaction as a fee, and they typically charge annual interest rates of 15 percent or more on balances that customers don’t pay off at the end of each month.

That business model is increasingly lucrative. Many consumers, their wages stagnant and their costs rising, are growing reliant on credit cards for essential goods and services, including medical and dental care. Across the industry, profits rose in the latest quarter.

At Bank of America, credit and debit card spending is up 7 percent this year compared with last. “Consumers are spending,” Brian T. Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call last week. The bank’s chief financial officer noted that the company’s cards business enjoyed better growth “than we’ve experienced in quite some time.”

Rivals are experiencing a similar surge. A strong consumer business, including card growth, helped JPMorgan increase its profits last quarter despite declines in traditional profit engines such as trading.

At Citigroup, an exclusive card deal with Costco — in which the bank provides branded credit cards to the discount-retail giant — has been “a real winner,” said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. He said customers were spending more on their Costco cards and rolling over larger balances.

Such surprisingly strong performances — the four leading banks raked in a total of $21 billion in profits during the third quarter — helped propel shares of banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America to their highest levels in years.

Spending on plastic is part of a broader debt bonanza. In May, total household debt levels hit a post-recession peak of $12.7 trillion.

Photo

The rising numbers reflect a growing economy and a robust financial system able to provide credit to people who need it, banking officials and analysts say.

“Delinquencies on credit cards have stayed remarkably low for five years. They’ve been well below their historical averages,” said James Chessen, the chief economist for the American Bankers Association. “We attribute that to consumers continuing to be very smart about how they use their cards, and very careful about how much debt they take.”

But what’s good for banks and their shareholders isn’t necessarily good for all bank customers.

Cynthia Regis, 73, worked for more than two decades as a home health care aide but has virtually no savings. To help pay her electric bill and to buy groceries, she racked up a balance of more than $6,000 on a Discover credit card. The annual interest rate is 29 percent, which makes it hard for her to whittle down her outstanding balance. One month this year, for example, her payment of $159 mostly covered her interest payments, shaving only $5 off her total debt.

“I’m barely making it,” Ms. Regis said.

Many Americans have seen their savings winnowed by a combination of the recession and stagnant wages. Almost half of adults said they could not pay for a $400 expense without selling something or borrowing money, the Federal Reserve has found. Some 44 percent of people with credit cards are currently carrying a balance, according to the American Bankers Association’s latest quarterly analysis, up 1.7 percentage points from the same period two years ago.

Older Americans, like Ms. Regis and Ms. Murray, living on a fixed income, are turning to credit cards to make ends meet, according to economists, lawyers and other experts.

“These cards are a social safety net,” said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan. He said he had seen thousands of clients made insolvent by a single unexpected cost.

For borrowers with shaky credit, interest rates can near 36 percent. Some borrowers end up owing more in interest than they originally spent on their cards.

Just making the minimum monthly payments on her cards costs Ms. Murray $500. That eats up more than half of what she receives from Social Security.

Photo

The cost to borrowers is creeping upward. The average interest rate on new credit card offers currently hovers at 16.15 percent, the highest level in at least a decade, according to data collected by CreditCards.com.

For banks, this is especially welcome because relatively few borrowers appear to be at risk of default. That means the banks pocket big fees and interest payments with minimal costs.

“A lot of the signs we look for in terms of the deterioration of the consumer, I’ve got to say, right now, we just don’t see,” Michael L. Corbat, Citigroup’s chief executive, told analysts last week. “We would rate the health of the consumer right now as pretty good.”

But a few small cracks are starting to show. Most of the major banks increased the amount of money they put aside to cover possible credit-card defaults in the most recent quarter. The recent spate of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, took a toll, and all of the banks expect to see their rate of defaulted loans rise in the coming months.

A recent analysis of Federal Reserve data by the debt-rating firm Moody’s found that working-class families, those with a median income of about $33,000, were starting to spend a higher portion of their income — slightly more than 15 percent — on debt payments, compared with what they spent three years earlier. As other expenses like health care and housing rise, more of those families are at risk of falling behind on their debts, it warned.

Pearline Rivers-Sobers got a credit card from Synchrony Financial at a local chiropractor when her late husband needed treatment that she couldn’t afford. The card later came in handy when her son needed glasses. Then she got another and another. Soon her wallet was stuffed with cards from CareCredit, Modell’s Sporting Goods, Linens ’n Things, Toys “R” Us, Sleepy’s and Old Navy. (Despite the logos they carry, those cards are also issued by banks.)

For a while, she kept up on payments, even managing to pay off two cards. But she has fallen behind on payments to at least five different banks, including Citigroup and Capital One.

“I was spending each month scrounging together money that basically did not even pay the interest,” Ms. Rivers-Sobers said.

Now, she said, she is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The banks that issued her the cards are likely to receive a fraction of what she owes them.

And Finally ...

In the charred rubble of Santa Rosa it was the McDonald’s that drew Penny Wolin, a photographer who lives nearby.

Touring the destruction last week, she said she was stunned by the amount of destruction. “I had to really calm down,” she said.

She arrived at a shopping complex on the western edge of the 101 Freeway, which the Tubbs Fire had leapt in its sprint into the Coffey Park neighborhood.

A Kmart and an Americas Best Value Inn had been incinerated. So had the McDonald’s, yet some of the restaurant’s cheery exterior remained intact.

“It’s still looking sort of normal, like ‘Come on in,’” said Ms. Wolin, 64. “But in fact the plastic is melted on the post and the arches had fallen to the ground and the ‘McDonald’s’ is so burned it’s almost a black-and-white photograph.”

She continued, “I’ll tell you, that, for me, tells the whole thing and points the way to our larger American society for the moment.”

Ms. Wolin shared a collection of her images. It’s called “Good Morning McDonald’s.”

Trump had that “kind of bluntness and occasionally even crass language which, if nothing else, at least meant authenticity,” said Jay Heiler, a lawyer considering a run against Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a rare Republican critic of Trump. “The president just hit a lot of nerves that a lot of conventional politicians didn’t even know were there.”

Those nerves still tingle. Nine months into the presidency, the support of Trump’s base remains fervid. I am often asked whether I believe Trump will be impeached. I’ve taken to responding that it’s more likely he’ll be a two-term president. I’d put the chances of impeachment at under 10 percent and of his re-election at about 25 percent.

That’s partly because the Democratic Party has not yet begun a serious reckoning with its defeat last year. It hasn’t grasped the degree to which it lives, still, in a coastal echo chamber of identity politics and Trump-bashing. Being anti-Trump won’t cut it. As Chuck Coughlin, a Republican political consultant who once worked for Senator John McCain, put it to me: “Somebody who speaks to common-sense American values — that is what the Democrats need.” I’m not sure who that person is but am pretty sure she or he does not reside in New York, Massachusetts or California.

Coughlin went on: “A Democratic party that can’t tell me how many genders there are, that ain’t flying in this country.”

American fracture is the nation’s overriding condition. It keeps widening. Jeff DeWit, the Republican state treasurer of Arizona, picked up Trump at the airport for that 2015 Phoenix rally; he remains an ardent fan of Trump’s “movement of people dying for something different.”

His deputy, Mark Swenson, told me: “America was formed by a bunch of people who just wanted to be left alone.” For that, guns help. “Bad guys have guns, so good guys should have guns, too,” Dewit said, rejecting my suggestion that the recent American carnage in Las Vegas showed the need for stricter gun laws.

Trump winks at white supremacists, thrives on confrontation and debases the Oval Office. But it would be a huge mistake to conclude from this that his defeat is inevitable; or that his supporters do not include millions of decent, smart Americans who just view the world differently. Americans who feel culturally alienated from the globalized metropolis (and sense their worldview elicits contempt in a Democratic Party that often seems to have lost touch with ordinary Americans).

Heiler, the pro-Trump lawyer considering a Senate run, turned to the president’s campaign against black footballers who refuse to stand for the national anthem. “Many African-Americans are focused on a particular set of facts and circumstances” that “drive that conduct, that protest,” Heiler said. “But when many other Americans see it, and Americans of all races,” they think “gosh, these guys all have it pretty good. You know they make a really good living, playing football. This country’s been really good to them. And so, even if they have an ax to grind, they shouldn’t grind it against the country or its symbol or its anthem.”

Heiler said he wouldn’t condemn the protesting players’ choice, even if he disagreed, but “there’s simply no getting around that when you make that choice you’re going to alienate a lot of Americans.”

Now the vague particular “circumstances” alluded to by Heiler includes gross police brutality against black kids and the history of oppression of African-Americans. Players who protest are exercising a fundamental American right. But yes, they are “going to alienate a lot of Americans.” Trump, at some level, is going to win this argument.

An overriding lesson of 2016 for liberals is that without hard-nosed realism about the state of the country and Trump’s talents, you lose. And that’s the truth.

The announcement that a coalition had been formed came after a tumultuous campaign in which the National Party won 56 seats — more than any other party — but failed to capture the 61 needed for a parliamentary majority to govern in New Zealand’s political system.

In the Sept. 23 election, the center-left Labour Party won 46 seats, and its left-leaning allies the Greens won eight, giving the left bloc a total of 54.

The close result set off a scramble between the two groups to win the favor of New Zealand First, a populist party that won nine seats — enough to put either National, or the Greens and Labour, over the line in forming a government.

In the kingmaker position was New Zealand First’s leader, Winston Peters, an eccentric veteran politician who has long campaigned on cuts to immigration, curtailing foreign ownership of New Zealand land, and securing pensions and other benefits for retirees, who make up a large percentage of the party’s base of support.

While those issues were not at the forefront of political debate ahead of the election, they were thrust front and center after the vote as both major parties spent the last month wooing Mr. Peters with policy proposals.

Mr. Peters, 72, has been in this position twice before: once in 1996, in a coalition with National that fell apart two years later, and in a coalition with Labour in 2005. He has a famously truculent relationship with the news media and remained tight-lipped throughout the coalition negotiation process, leaving analysts speculating about whom he would anoint as prime minister.

In throwing his support to Ms. Ardern, Mr. Peters said, “It’s time for capitalism to regain its human face.”

The New Zealand First leader kept the country guessing for weeks about whom he would support, keeping it secret until the minute he took to a podium at the Parliament building Thursday. He revealed he had told neither Ms. Ardern nor Mr. English of his decision before announcing it.

Ms. Ardern took control of the Labour Party in July after its leader, Andrew Little, quit amid dismal poll numbers. She enjoyed a wave of attention for her charisma, for her youth, and for condemning a television commentator’s question about whether employers have a right to know whether a woman plans to become a parent.

During the campaign, she emphasized issues including child poverty, environmental management and housing affordability.

The campaign was raucous, at least by the standards of New Zealand, a prosperous member of the Commonwealth that has largely been spared the divisive debate over migration that has roiled its larger neighbor, Australia.

Mr. English, a former finance minister, had taken the reins of the country in December after his predecessor, John Key, unexpectedly resigned, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. During the campaign, Mr. English emphasized the party’s stewardship of the economy, which has recovered strongly from the financial crisis that was underway when the National Party swept to power in 2008.

Before Ms. Ardern captured Labour’s leadership, the party had cycled through five leaders since the last Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, lost the 2008 election. None of those leaders managed to cut into National’s popularity — which was buoyed by New Zealand’s strong economy — but Ms. Ardern’s call for change and youthful energy invigorated her party, winning it new supporters.

After discussing its role in the new government, the Green Party said it would not be a formal part of the Labour-New Zealand First coalition but would lend its votes to help the government pass laws. Some of its lawmakers will become government ministers.

That tremor you felt last week was the dropping of a new John Green novel, “Turtles All the Way Down,” his first since “The Fault in Our Stars” and a seismic event not just in young people’s literature but in all people’s literature. The other tremor you felt was the dropping of a new Ron Chernow biography, “Grant,” the story of the general turned president tasked with the ultimate political challenge, uniting a post-civil-war society. We recommend them both — just don’t drop Chernow’s actual book; at 1,074 pages, it might break something.

THE COLLECTED ESSAYS OF ELIZABETH HARDWICK, Selected and with an introduction by Darryl Pinckney. (New York Review Books, $19.95.) “To move one’s way through Hardwick’s essays is to bump into brightness on nearly every page,” writes our critic Dwight Garner about this volume of writings by one of the co-founders of the New York Review of Books and a landmark American critic. Hardwick, who died in 2007, “had fresh eyes, quick wits, good feelers and was murderously well-read.”

TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN, by John Green. (Dutton, $19.99.) Green’s new novel, his first since the mega-best-selling “The Fault in Our Stars,” is “by far his most difficult to read,” writes our critic Jennifer Senior. “It’s also his most astonishing.” The story of Aza, a 16-year-old who suffers from anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, delves into familiar Green themes of love and suffering, working toward an ending that Senior describes as “so surprising and moving and true that I became completely unstrung.”

GRANT, by Ron Chernow. (Penguin Press, $40.) Chernow gives us a Grant for our time, comprehensively recounting not only the victories of the Civil War general but also the challenges of a president who fought against white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan and championed the right of eligible citizens to exercise the vote. “For all its scholarly and literary strengths,” writes former President Bill Clinton, “this book’s greatest service is to remind us of Grant’s significant achievements at the end of the war and after, which have too long been overlooked and are too important today to be left in the dark.”

GOOD ME BAD ME, by Ali Land. (Flatiron, $25.99.) This debut novel’s teenage narrator, Milly, is speaking to the mother she loves and misses. It’s a one-sided conversation because her mother is about to go on trial for murder, and her daughter is the one who turned her in. Land is a mental health nurse who has worked with traumatized children, and her portrait of Milly has a powerful sense of authenticity.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
We are a long way from that better world, in part because so many seemingly well-intentioned people buy into the precepts of rape culture. So many people want to believe there are only a few bad men. So many people want to believe they don’t know any bad men. So many people do not realize they are bad men. So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry. There is no escaping the inappropriate attentions and intentions of men.

These same people buy into the myth that there are ways women can avoid sexual violence and harassment — if we act nicer or drink less or dress less provocatively or smile or show a little gratitude or, or, or — because boys will be boys, because men are so fragile, so frenzied with sexual need that they cannot simply control themselves and their baser impulses.

Some people insinuate that women themselves can stave off attacks. They insist we can wear modest clothes or be grateful for unconventional looks, or that we can avoid “asking for it” by “presenting all the sensuality and the sexuality,” as Donna Karan has said. With each of these betrayals, the burden we all carry grows heavier.

What this reasoning does not grapple with — and it is a perennial rejoinder to discussions of sexual assault and women’s vulnerability — is that no one escapes unwanted male attention because they don’t meet certain beauty standards or because they don’t dress a certain way. They escape because they are lucky.

Sexual violence is about power. There is a sexual component, yes, but mostly it’s about someone exerting his or her will over another and deriving pleasure and satisfaction from that exertion. We cannot forget this, or the women and men who have been harassed or assaulted but aren’t “conventionally attractive” will be ignored, silenced, or worse, disbelieved.

And then there are the ways that women diminish their experiences as “not that bad.” Because it was just a cat call. It was just a man grabbing me. It was just a man shoving me up against a wall. It was just a man raping me. He didn’t have a weapon. He stopped following me after 10 blocks. He didn’t leave many bruises. He didn’t kill me, therefore it is not that bad. Nothing I deal with in this country compares with what women in other parts of the world deal with. We offer up this refrain over and over because that is what we need to tell ourselves, because if we were to face how bad it really is, we might not be able to shoulder the burden for one moment longer.

In the wake of the Weinstein allegations, a list appeared online, an anonymous accounting of men in media who have committed a range of infractions from sleazy DMs to rape. And just as quickly as the list appeared, it disappeared. I saw the list. A couple of people didn’t belong on it simply because their behaviors weren’t sexual in nature, but some of them were men whose behavior called for a warning and who deserved public shame. Even where I live, outside the media bubble, in a small town in Indiana, I had already heard some of the stories that were shared.

There are a great many open secrets about bad men.

As the list circulated, there was a lot of hand-wringing about libel and the ethics of anonymous disclosure. There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men. There was concern that the “milder” infractions would be conflated with the more serious ones, as if women lack the capacity for critical thinking and discernment about behaviors that are or are not appropriate in professional contexts. More energy was spent worrying about how men were affected than worrying about the pain women have suffered. Women were not trusted to create a tangible artifact of their experiences so that they might have more to rely upon than the whisper networks women have long cultivated to warn one another about the bad men they encounter.

Meanwhile, there was a hashtag, #metoo — a chorus of women and some men sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Me too, me too, me too. I thought about participating but I was just too tired. I have nothing more to say about my history of violence beyond saying I have been hurt, almost too many times to count. I have been hurt enough that some terrible things no longer even register as pain.

We already know victims’ stories. Women testify about their hurt, publicly and privately, all the time. When this happens, men, in particular, act shocked and surprised that sexual violence is so pervasive because they are afforded the luxury of oblivion. And then they start to panic because not all men are predators and they don’t want to be lumped in with the bad men and they make women’s pain all about themselves. They choose not to face that enough men are predators that women engage in all sorts of protective behaviors and strategies so that they might stop adding to their testimony. And then there are the men who act so overwhelmed, who ask, “What can I possibly do?”

The answer is simple.

Men can start putting in some of the work women have long done in offering testimony. They can come forward and say “me too” while sharing how they have hurt women in ways great and small. They can testify about how they have cornered women in narrow office hallways or made lewd comments to co-workers or refused to take no for an answer or worn a woman down by guilting her into sex and on and on and on. It would equally be a balm if men spoke up about the times when they witnessed violence or harassment and looked the other way or laughed it off or secretly thought a woman was asking for it. It’s time for men to start answering for themselves because women cannot possibly solve this problem they had no hand in creating.

It’s when we get to the social world that things really get gnarly. A lot of our thinking is for bonding, not truth-seeking, so most of us are quite willing to think or say anything that will help us be liked by our group. We’re quite willing to disparage anyone when, as Marilynne Robinson once put it, “the reward is the pleasure of sharing an attitude one knows is socially approved.” And when we don’t really know a subject well enough, in T. S. Eliot’s words, “we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts,” and go with whatever idea makes us feel popular.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Back when they wrote the book of Proverbs it was said, “By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.” These days, a soft tongue doesn’t get you very far, but someday it might again.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

One theme entry that I had to think about, but which I eventually got, was 10D’s “Where ‘flanked’ is in the dictionary?” The answer is UNDER FIRE, which is technically true from a dictionary standpoint. A “flanking maneuver” in a military sense can mean to attack around a flank to achieve an advantageous position over an adversary.

In non-theme news, I really liked Mr. Mahnken’s fill, which I’m told was a collaboration between the puzzle maker and the editors. Any puzzle that can debut both BROWNIE MIX and SONIC YOUTH is O.K. by me, and I GOT NEXT and DARE I SAY next to each other was a lot of fun.

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

2D: I had REFILL before REFUEL.

26D: “Glam rock?” is some nifty misdirection. You were thinking of a bunch of longhaired, bespangled musicians in heavy eyeliner, weren’t you? Not today. Another type of glamorous rock would be a GEM.

Let’s say hello to Evan Manhken:

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

Mr. Mulherin is a devotee of the genre’s older standard-bearers — “I never stopped listening to these bands,” he said of groups like Mineral and the Promise Ring.

“I haven’t spoke to you since 17/Just thought I’d let you know you’re dead to me,” he lovingly sings on the spooky, abraded “Clarity in Kerosene,” one of the album’s most anguished songs. At the chorus, Mr. Mulherin toggles back and forth between shrieking and soothing, and in the verses, he alternates between a kind of whispered, conspiratorial singing and nimble rapping.

The music is similarly piercing and caressing. Mr. Mulherin often plays with an arid electric guitar tone redolent of lonely folk music. “I’m really into open tunings,” he said. “There’s something about that tone that’s chilly, that’s kind of cold and removed.” His beats are urgent and dark. (He produced the album with the punk producer Erik Ron and JayVee, a SoundCloud collaborator.)

The music of nothing,nowhere. is an intriguing turn for emo, which has been through at least four waves, and has been celebrating a revival by classicist-minded new bands in recent years. Mr. Mulherin is a devotee of the genre’s older standard-bearers — “I never stopped listening to these bands,” he said of groups like Mineral and the Promise Ring. But he’s part of a young, still relatively fringe group of artists, largely gathered on SoundCloud, that is melding vintage emo with contemporary hip-hop production, finding unlikely kinship.

In the way that the rise of Drake portended the final obliteration of the wall between hip-hop and R&B, the music of nothing,nowhere. — along with other SoundCloud-first artists including Lil Peep — helps bridge the chasm between rock and hip-hop. Unlike the rap-rock of a decade and a half ago, which was often clunky, expressed via brute force and a constant reminder of its forebears, Mr. Mulherin’s blend is seamless and intuitive.

That’s clearest on the ethereal and sinewy “Hopes Up,” which features a guest appearance by the emo godfather Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional.

Mr. Carrabba likened nothing,nowhere.’s embrace of hip-hop to his own generation’s engagement with hardcore: “Some of the trappings are similar: posturing, hypermasculine, not necessarily inclusive, cocky and braggadocious,” he said in a phone interview. “Joe seems to have embraced the best pieces of that and laid the tropes aside. That’s where I see a connection to our generation.”

Mr. Mulherin still has the voice mail saved on his phone of Mr. Carrabba agreeing to sing on the track and asking “to hear more of your music just because I’m kind of obsessed with this song.” He said hearing that kind of praise from someone he looked up to “really puts wind in my sails, because I’m not the most confident person.”

Mr. Mulherin was raised in Foxborough, Mass. but spent summers in this part of Vermont. By the time he began taking guitar lessons at 12, he was already immersed in the bruising rap-rock of the era, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park (“my first vulnerable band”), and also emo and post-hardcore bands like Taking Back Sunday, Thursday and Senses Fail.

Allergan’s deal with the tribe did not extend to the legal battle playing out in the Eastern District of Texas, where manufacturers of generic drugs, including Teva Pharmaceuticals and Mylan, are also fighting Allergan over the validity of the patents. The tribe did not claim sovereign immunity in that case.

In a ruling on Monday, Judge Bryson criticized Allergan’s deal with the tribe and said such arrangements could ultimately damage the country’s patent process.

“Sovereign immunity should not be treated as a monetizable commodity that can be purchased by private entities as part of a scheme to evade their legal responsibilities,” he wrote.

In a statement, Allergan said it was “carefully reviewing the court’s decision.”

The patent office is still reviewing the case, including the Mohawks’ argument that the patents are protected by the tribe’s sovereign immunity. The two legal processes operate independently of each other, although decisions in federal court typically supersede the administrative review, experts said.

“If a court overturns the patent, then that is game over for the patent,” said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law.

Brendan F. White, a spokesman for the tribe, said it was “in the process of reviewing the decision and its impact on our patent business.” Under the deal, Allergan paid the tribe $13.75 million, with the promise of $15 million in annual royalties as long as the patents remained valid.

Allergan’s arrangement with the Mohawk tribe had been greeted with outrage by members of Congress and consumer groups, who said it was just the latest tactic by drug makers to foil generic competitors and protect their profits.

The tribe had countered that it was within its rights and that further deals could serve as an added source of revenue for its community of more than 15,000 people in a rural, economically depressed region near the Canadian border.

Allergan has said it entered into the deal with the tribe to avoid what it described as the double jeopardy of having its patents challenged in both federal court and through the administrative review. Many patent holders have argued that the administrative process is unfair and unnecessary because patents already can be challenged in federal courts.

The review was created by Congress in 2011 as a way to streamline patent challenges by allowing them to be decided by a panel, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The Supreme Court will take up the issue next year in the case Oil States vs. Greene’s Energy Group.

There’s no shortage of images from New York City’s subway system, with millions of smartphone-toting riders each day. Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

In St. Louis, Protests Over Police Violence Disrupt Economy, and Win Attention

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
While regional leaders say they are confident the area can thrive economically amid the demonstrations, protest leaders have gotten their attention.
“But we’re not done.”There have been protests nearly every day since the verdict in the Stockley case on Sept. 15.
They have swept up an undercover officer, an Air Force lieutenant, a reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and people who were not protesting.
“The Police Department has taken a black eye,” said Heather Taylor, a police sergeant here who is president of the Ethical Society of Police, the union representing black officers.
“I think we’ve earned it.”Ms. Krewson, who is white, made the unusual step of publicly criticizing her chief, calling his remarks inflammatory.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
In the weeks since, a small but spirited group has taken to the streets of St. Louis and surrounding communities almost every night to protest police violence, inspired by the acquittal last month of Jason Stockley, a white former police officer, in the fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, who was black.

Although the demonstrations have not drawn the crowds or national media attention of those in nearby Ferguson and other cities, the outrage of Mr. Sommers reflects the surprising impact they have had.

While regional leaders say they are confident the area can thrive economically amid the demonstrations, protest leaders have gotten their attention. The protesters have largely won the public relations battle against the police — who have made some embarrassing missteps in their handling of the demonstrations — and have seized the media narrative, with the local press reporting on their complaints against particular officers and police tactics.

With a focus on disrupting the city’s economy, the protests have forced the city to pay more than $3 million in police overtime and have led to lost revenue after a couple of major concerts were canceled. Demonstrations — or even just the fear of them — have prompted grocery stores and malls to temporarily close. And some wonder whether the unrest will harm the region’s bid to lure the new Amazon headquarters.

Since the protests started, Ms. Krewson, who came to the mayor’s job this year lacking a reputation as a racial justice advocate, has vowed to work quickly to enact police reforms and address racial inequities. She has publicly criticized Lawrence O’Toole, the interim police chief she selected, and questioned the tactics his officers employed during the protests, calling for an independent investigation into allegations of brutality — a call that Chief O’Toole joined.

Joe Reagan, the president of the St. Louis Regional Chamber of Commerce who is white, published an opinion piece in a local African-American newspaper urging swift police reforms to help the region’s economic health, and voiced support for an investigation.

“I think people are nervous about irreparable harm to the civic identity,” said the Rev. Starsky Wilson, a co-chairman of the commission created in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting.

If nothing else, said Mr. Wilson, who is black, the persistent protests should alert cities nationwide that people will not be satisfied by endless commissions and policy proposals that do not result in action.

“They’ll be back if you don’t take seriously their concerns,” he said.

Still, demonstrators are not declaring victory.

For as much as they have gotten Ms. Krewson’s attention, she has not heeded one of their loudest demands — to immediately replace Chief O’Toole, who is white, with a chief they believe would work better with the community.

Many of the changes they are asking for — more robust civilian oversight, a more diverse department, bridging racial inequalities — are fixes that will take time. And many familiar racial divisions remain: At a recent St. Louis County Council meeting over police pay raises, the pro-police crowd was largely white, applauding those who spoke in favor of officers but remaining silent when others advocated reforms.

“We haven’t seen any real, tangible, systemic change at all, from how the police are allowed to police us to how they’re allowed to engage with us during protests,” said Dhoruba Shakur, a 27-year-old black man, as he marched alongside a group of about 50 protesters on a recent evening with an AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder. “But we’re not done.”

There have been protests nearly every day since the verdict in the Stockley case on Sept. 15. The core group organizing the demonstrations cut their teeth in Ferguson and say they have adjusted their strategy based on their experiences there.

They focus on protests that cause economic disruption, often targeting white neighborhoods.

“We are bringing it to the doors of people who do not have to live this life and just giving that little bit of uncomfortableness,” said LaShell Eikerenkoetter, a protest leader who is black. “Now you understand what we as black folks feel and why we are out here.”

The demonstrations employ an element of surprise to throw off the police. They have attracted a diverse crowd and word is spread by live-streaming demonstrations online.

“Ferguson, we were driven off passion, anger. We were just flat out mad,” said Bruce Franks Jr., a state representative who is black, and who began his activism in Ferguson. “Now we’re mad, we’re still passionate, we’re still angry. But we concentrate heavily on strategy now.”

The demonstrations have made some people afraid to come to the city because they fear that there is chaos and that police officers are afraid to do their jobs, said Brad Waldrop, a real estate developer who is white. Mr. Waldrop is skeptical that the attempt by protesters to apply economic pressure will lead to broad reforms, because of all the municipalities and counties in the region that operate independently.

Some of the activists’ biggest victories have come at the expense of the police.

Officers have made more than 300 arrests, some of them questionable. They have swept up an undercover officer, an Air Force lieutenant, a reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and people who were not protesting. The newspaper published accounts of people who said the police struck or pepper-sprayed them after they had been taken to the ground.

The police took on more criticism when video captured some officers stealing a protest chant: “Whose streets? Our streets.” Chief O’Toole only made things worse when he later declared that the police had “owned tonight.” And many were outraged at a photo that showed a suburban police officer with his hand around the throat of an elderly black woman during a demonstration in a shopping mall.

The episodes have eroded trust in a force already struggling to improve community relations in a city trying to rein in its high murder rate, residents said.

“The Police Department has taken a black eye,” said Heather Taylor, a police sergeant here who is president of the Ethical Society of Police, the union representing black officers. “I think we’ve earned it.”

Ms. Krewson, who is white, made the unusual step of publicly criticizing her chief, calling his remarks inflammatory. She requested that the Justice Department investigate allegations of officer misconduct in their response.

“I hear them louder,” Ms. Krewson said of the protesters. “I understand them better because we’re living this day-to-day.”

When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
(“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.)
A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy.
On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend.
It’s not good.”If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career.
“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.

An Apple Pie That Lasts for Days

Many home bakers assume that when it comes to pie crust, thinner is better. “People are worried that they’re doing it wrong,” said Kate McDermott, a professional “pie coach” who holds frequent workshops. “So they keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, until the crust is much thinner than it needs to be.”

Many modern recipes call for a crust that is an eighth-inch thick. But Ms. McDermott rolls out her crusts to at least a quarter-inch, a more traditional proportion.

Double-crust pies were invented many centuries ago to serve as durable cases for valuable ingredients like meat, sugar, spices and citrus peel (and occasionally live birds, frogs and humans). “It was the original Tupperware,” said Ms. McDermott, author of “Art of the Pie.”

Those crusts were not necessarily meant to be eaten. To this day, a good pie must have a stable marriage of filling and crust.

To achieve this, a fully baked, not-soggy crust is essential. A sturdy crust (like the one on a baguette) can often be chewy and tough. The genius of the traditional method for making pie crust — with large, flat flakes of flour and butter — is that, once baked, it is both strong and tender.

A thick crust demands a heavy, heat-conducting dish. Thin metal does not provide the even, steady heat that’s needed to cook this crust through. Thick glass is fine if you want to check the color of the crust, but heavy ceramics (like stoneware, earthenware and porcelain) are actually better at browning, according to Ms. McDermott. Her trick of baking the pie on a preheated baking sheet (to ensure that heat reaches the crust quickly) means that there’s no reason to doubt that the bottom crust is cooked when the other signs of doneness (bubbling filling, brown top crust) are there.

However, you do not need a pie pan to bake a pie, especially a deep-dish pie. The sloped sides of a traditional pie dish are there to make it easier to slice and serve, but they are certainly not necessary. Any baking dish of any shape can be used, as long as it is at least two inches deep and holds 2½ to 3 quarts. Use your most-loved casserole or cast-iron skillet. Your favorite dish may not have a rim, but you don’t need one — this pie’s crust is thick enough to make its own.

And which apples? A pie made with a dozen Granny Smith apples may be inedible, but a pie made with four Granny Smith apples may be irresistible. Generally, a mix of tart and sweet apples gives the best odds of a great filling. Though some claim that ancient breeds like sweet Bramleys and tart Pippins make the best pies, many of the newer apples on the market — Honeycrisps and Pink Ladys, Ginger Golds and Cameos — offer a good balance of sweet and tart.

These new apples also hold their shape in baking, because snacking apples are bred to be firm and “explosively crunchy,” according to Rowan Jacobsen, author of “Apples of Uncommon Character.”

“Crispness has become super-valued,” he said.

An interplay of sweet and sour flavors, plus firm and soft textures, is the goal. “You need the mortar and you need the bricks,” Mr. Jacobsen said of a good filling. If using crunchy apples, toss in a MacIntosh, Idared or Cortland. Those apples will break down during baking and bind the filling. (A spoonful of applesauce will do the same thing.)

And when it comes to maximizing apple flavor, Ms. McDermott takes no chances, boosting it at every opportunity. Instead of lemon juice, commonly added to balance the sweetness of added sugar, she uses unfiltered apple cider vinegar; she also deploys a shot of apple liqueur, schnapps or brandy, like French Calvados. Cider syrup, apple cider and apple juice are perfectly fine nonalcoholic alternatives.

“Pie is very forgiving,” she said. “It is happy as long as it is made.”

Republicans Ready to Move on a Tax Plan Few Have Seen

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Party leaders say they have learned from those setbacks, including the collapse of the health care push this summer.
It centers on deep cuts to business tax rates, which Republicans promise will deliver income gains to middle-class workers.
That document, which would be an agreement between the House and Senate, is crucial to allowing Republicans to change tax law without any Democratic support.
Republican leaders say there has been enough discussion of tax issues to warrant a fast vote.
“The quicker we can get this done, the quicker we can start growing the economy,” said Matthew M. Miller, a vice president for the Business Roundtable who handles tax issues.

The last major tax overhaul, which passed in 1986, took nearly 11 months from introduction to presidential signature.

“Some have described Washington as the slowest town until it is the fastest town,” said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax Policy in the House Ways and Means Committee, “and I think that’s what’s going to happen here.”

Congressional Republicans are under intense pressure from campaign donors, business groups and the White House to deliver a major legislative victory after nine months of congressional disappointment on big issues. Party leaders say they have learned from those setbacks, including the collapse of the health care push this summer.

Lawmakers “should have had a bill six months ago,” said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, who is advising the White House on the tax effort. “They will look so incompetent if they don’t get this done,” he said, adding that Republicans know the economy could suffer and that they could lose badly in the midterm elections next year if they do not pass something quickly. “Ultimately, that’s why I’m optimistic.”

The bills being drafted, as described by top Republicans and lobbyists, would affect family budgets across the United States, by altering tax brackets and some popular deductions, and investment decisions around the globe, by changing the way the United States taxes multinational companies. It centers on deep cuts to business tax rates, which Republicans promise will deliver income gains to middle-class workers.

Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress released an outline of their plan in September, which included reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a doubling of the standard deduction for individual income tax filers and the elimination of several widely claimed deductions for individuals. The framework put down a marker but left dozens of questions unresolved, many of them potentially worth billions of dollars to businesses and the federal government.

Business groups are meeting frequently with key Republicans, seeking to shape the bill, but no snippets of legislative text have yet become public.

However, party leaders cannot finalize a bill until another budget hurdle is cleared — the Senate and House must agree on a consensus budget document, which will include instructions for how much a tax bill could reduce federal tax revenues over the next decade. That document, which would be an agreement between the House and Senate, is crucial to allowing Republicans to change tax law without any Democratic support. Such agreement could come quickly or drag out over a week or more, depending on whether House members agree to the Senate version or demand substantial changes to it.

Republican leaders hope to finalize and introduce the House version of the tax bill as soon as early November, allow amendments from both parties in committee and on the House floor, and pass something by Thanksgiving. Senate leaders hope to pass a bill by December or early next year.

Democrats say that process does not allow time for careful consideration of the bill, or for the sort of bipartisan compromise that marked the 1986 effort.

“I can’t imagine that something this momentous would be done without hearings, when you consider they’re about to fundamentally alter the architecture of the nation’s revenue collection,” said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.

Republican leaders say there has been enough discussion of tax issues to warrant a fast vote. The House Ways and Means Committee has conducted more than 40 hearings on tax issues over the past five years, and the Senate Finance Committee has held 70.

“The quicker we can get this done, the quicker we can start growing the economy,” said Matthew M. Miller, a vice president for the Business Roundtable who handles tax issues. “There’s been thorough opportunity to have discussions on what the policy needs to be.”

Michael A. Steel, a managing director at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington and a longtime aide to John A. Boehner, the former House speaker, said that he expected “an intense, if not frenetic” debate between the introduction of the bill and the votes in committee and on the floor. Businesses, he added, were preparing their arguments in the hopes of changing any provisions that could hurt them financially.

He said he was optimistic that the House could finish its work by the end of November — a contrast to several fiscal fights waged in late December when Mr. Boehner was speaker and Barack Obama was president.

“This is a wrinkle, having a legislative deadline threaten Thanksgiving,” Mr. Steel said. “We usually screw up Christmas.”

Puerto Ricans Ask: When Will the Lights Come Back On?

In contrast with Texas after Hurricane Harvey and Florida after Irma, where thousands of repair workers rushed in to restring power lines, only a few hundred electrical workers from outside the island have arrived to help.

It was not until Saturday that the Puerto Rican government said it had the federal funding needed to bring in more workers. And until a week ago, the small Montana company hired to get the lights back on had only 165 workers on the ground; it now has about 300.

In comparison, 5,300 workers from outside the region converged on coastal Texas in the days after Hurricane Harvey to restore a power loss that was about a tenth the size, said Larry Jones, a spokesman for AEP Texas. Electricity was back on for almost everyone within two weeks.

In Florida, 18,000 outside workers went in after Hurricane Irma knocked out electricity to most of the state last month, according to FPL, Florida’s largest power company.

In Puerto Rico, the brunt of the work has been left to the 900 members of local crews.

Industry experts said poor planning, a slow response by power officials and Puerto Rico’s dire financial straits had led to a situation that would be unfathomable in the continental United States. Logistical challenges — like where to house the thousands of extra workers needed to get the lights back on — still have not been resolved.

“Thirty days after the storm, I see very little progress,” said Eduardo Bhatia, an opposition senator who in 2014 wrote an energy reform law. He added, “I don’t see the boots on the field doing the work, and that is a tragedy.”

At the White House on Thursday, President Trump said the administration deserved a 10 for its response to the hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico and other parts of the United States.

But he conceded that the destruction of the power grid was one of Puerto Rico’s biggest long-term challenges, despite the provision of “massive numbers” of generators to temporarily provide electricity to hospitals and other crucial facilities.

“You can’t really bring electric back until you rebuild the power plant,” Mr. Trump said during an appearance with Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico. The federal government will help rebuild the power grid, he said, but “the plant itself is going to take a while.”

In Gurabo, just outside Caguas, Reynaldo De Hostos spends most of his time outside seeking relief from insufferable indoor heat. “Ever since we lost electricity, we can’t sleep,” he said, standing inside his pitch-dark home. Every hour or so at night, he said, he and his family use the air-conditioning in the car for a brief respite.

Even local utility employees are frustrated. “We need trucks, we need poles, we need crews, we need lines, we need more people,” said Javier Hernández Saurí, a lineman who led a team of repair workers making their way up Mr. Rodríguez’s street. “It’s going very slowly.”

He added, “We’re rewiring mostly with materials that can be reused.”

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with restoring Puerto Rico’s power, estimated that it needed at least 2,000 additional workers. So far, the Corps has brought only about 200 workers, and most of them were dedicated not to restoring power but to installing generators at crucial locations.

After major storms, power companies typically rely on mutual aid agreements to get electricity restored. Outside companies send thousands of workers, and electric companies pay for the service with funds from FEMA.

Such agreements are “absolutely critical,” said Devon Streit, the deputy assistant secretary for infrastructure security at the Department of Energy, which is helping to coordinate the restoration of power. But in this instance, some companies were concerned about getting paid, she said, because the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, had filed for bankruptcy protection in July after defaulting on $9 billion in debt.

Ricardo Ramos, chief executive of the power authority, said outside companies had been hesitant to come until they knew where the storm would make landfall. After that, he needed several days to assess the damage, and communications were down.

By the time Mr. Ramos had a full grasp of the damage a week after the storm, he said, the Corps of Engineers had been tasked with overseeing power restoration, a duty outside its usual purview.

That was something of a relief, Mr. Ramos said, because mutual aid agreements cost millions of dollars that the power authority cannot spare.

“With the Corps of Engineers, they do the work, they pay for it, and they get reimbursed by FEMA,” he said. “So it never goes through my pocket.”

The Montana company he hired, Whitefish Energy Holdings, agreed to do the work without a down payment. The chief executive, Andy Techmanski, said that he got the contract because he showed up in Puerto Rico unannounced.

Mr. Ramos expressed no regrets.

“I mobilized what I could, which was private contractors, and I am happy with the decision. I would do exactly the same,” he said. “I think we’re right on target.”

The Corps of Engineers did not announce its large contract, for $240 million, until this week. An earlier $35 million contract was for mobile gas turbines, but the Corps said it did not know when the companies would be sending employees to Puerto Rico.

Brig. Gen. Diana Holland, the commander of the Corps’ South Atlantic Division, said the contracting process went “really quickly,” despite the fact that taxpayers demand a careful review of such emergency contracts.

For now, thousands of power poles remain on the ground. Most Puerto Ricans survive by storing food in ice chests or eating in the few open restaurants. They swat mosquitoes that fly in through the open windows, and some wait in line for hours to get ice. With about a third of the island’s bank branches still closed, lines snake around the block for access to cash machines.

“Last night, someone tried to break into my house and into two of my neighbors’ houses to steal. They tried to force the lock on our door,” said Mario Luis Casanova Caballero, a lineman working with Mr. Hernández Saurí who was using a generator to power his lights and to help keep refrigerators running for three neighbors.

When Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989, Mr. Ramos said, repairs took six months.

But on Saturday, Governor Rosselló committed to a more aggressive timetable, pledging to have 95 percent of power restored by December. His public affairs secretary, Ramón Rosario Cortés, acknowledged that the crews in place were not enough.

“We have 230 brigades. If we used only these brigades, we’d be talking long months — years,” Mr. Rosario said.

The governor said an additional 966 brigades would be trickling in over the next three weeks.

The number of workers, however, is not the only problem. The Corps of Engineers said damage to the island’s ports had slowed shipments of needed equipment, including utility poles and cable.

The task is also daunting, Mr. Ramos said, because some of the power plants date to the 1950s and were never maintained. Power was restored to parts of San Juan three times in the last few weeks, only for the grid to collapse.

As he waits, Mr. Rodríguez tries to get by the best that he can.

Generators are expensive, he said, and hard to find. And lines at the supermarket remain long.

“I buy our drinking water in Costco,” he said. “I made a three-hour line on Sunday to buy eight gallons of water. That’s what we’re surviving on.”

BARCELONA, Spain — These days, the city of Barcelona wears two hats. And not too comfortably.

On the one hand, Barcelona is a global city, a former host of the Olympics, and the home of one of the world’s most famous soccer clubs, F.C. Barcelona. It is a magnet for more than 10 million visitors a year, an example of the ways large cities increasingly influence global politics, economics and culture.

On the other hand, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, Spain’s restive northeastern region, and the nerve center of a drive for Catalan independence that is described by its opponents as parochial, exclusive and nationalist.

In that campaign — which the Spanish government now says it will take emergency measures to halt — there is no place in Catalonia with more at stake. In Barcelona, the issue of independence has provoked exceptionally sharp soul-searching and debate over allegiances and identity, with an intensity not seen since Britain voted to leave the European Union.

In short, people are worried. First among them is the city’s leftist mayor, Ada Colau, who is not in favor of leaving. “It’s a very pluralistic city and there is a lot of diversity of opinions in Barcelona,” she said in an interview this week.

The city is not exactly comparable to London — which favored remaining in the European Union — since Barcelona is still home to many separatists. “But if you compare it with people in the heart of Catalonia,” Ms. Colau said, “it’s not as pro-independence.”

In St. Louis, Protests Over Police Violence Disrupt Economy, and Win Attention

In the weeks since, a small but spirited group has taken to the streets of St. Louis and surrounding communities almost every night to protest police violence, inspired by the acquittal last month of Jason Stockley, a white former police officer, in the fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, who was black.

Although the demonstrations have not drawn the crowds or national media attention of those in nearby Ferguson and other cities, the outrage of Mr. Sommers reflects the surprising impact they have had.

While regional leaders say they are confident the area can thrive economically amid the demonstrations, protest leaders have gotten their attention. The protesters have largely won the public relations battle against the police — who have made some embarrassing missteps in their handling of the demonstrations — and have seized the media narrative, with the local press reporting on their complaints against particular officers and police tactics.

With a focus on disrupting the city’s economy, the protests have forced the city to pay more than $3 million in police overtime and have led to lost revenue after a couple of major concerts were canceled. Demonstrations — or even just the fear of them — have prompted grocery stores and malls to temporarily close. And some wonder whether the unrest will harm the region’s bid to lure the new Amazon headquarters.

Since the protests started, Ms. Krewson, who came to the mayor’s job this year lacking a reputation as a racial justice advocate, has vowed to work quickly to enact police reforms and address racial inequities. She has publicly criticized Lawrence O’Toole, the interim police chief she selected, and questioned the tactics his officers employed during the protests, calling for an independent investigation into allegations of brutality — a call that Chief O’Toole joined.

Joe Reagan, the president of the St. Louis Regional Chamber of Commerce who is white, published an opinion piece in a local African-American newspaper urging swift police reforms to help the region’s economic health, and voiced support for an investigation.

“I think people are nervous about irreparable harm to the civic identity,” said the Rev. Starsky Wilson, a co-chairman of the commission created in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting.

If nothing else, said Mr. Wilson, who is black, the persistent protests should alert cities nationwide that people will not be satisfied by endless commissions and policy proposals that do not result in action.

“They’ll be back if you don’t take seriously their concerns,” he said.

Still, demonstrators are not declaring victory.

For as much as they have gotten Ms. Krewson’s attention, she has not heeded one of their loudest demands — to immediately replace Chief O’Toole, who is white, with a chief they believe would work better with the community.

Many of the changes they are asking for — more robust civilian oversight, a more diverse department, bridging racial inequalities — are fixes that will take time. And many familiar racial divisions remain: At a recent St. Louis County Council meeting over police pay raises, the pro-police crowd was largely white, applauding those who spoke in favor of officers but remaining silent when others advocated reforms.

“We haven’t seen any real, tangible, systemic change at all, from how the police are allowed to police us to how they’re allowed to engage with us during protests,” said Dhoruba Shakur, a 27-year-old black man, as he marched alongside a group of about 50 protesters on a recent evening with an AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder. “But we’re not done.”

There have been protests nearly every day since the verdict in the Stockley case on Sept. 15. The core group organizing the demonstrations cut their teeth in Ferguson and say they have adjusted their strategy based on their experiences there.

They focus on protests that cause economic disruption, often targeting white neighborhoods.

“We are bringing it to the doors of people who do not have to live this life and just giving that little bit of uncomfortableness,” said LaShell Eikerenkoetter, a protest leader who is black. “Now you understand what we as black folks feel and why we are out here.”

The demonstrations employ an element of surprise to throw off the police. They have attracted a diverse crowd and word is spread by live-streaming demonstrations online.

“Ferguson, we were driven off passion, anger. We were just flat out mad,” said Bruce Franks Jr., a state representative who is black, and who began his activism in Ferguson. “Now we’re mad, we’re still passionate, we’re still angry. But we concentrate heavily on strategy now.”

The demonstrations have made some people afraid to come to the city because they fear that there is chaos and that police officers are afraid to do their jobs, said Brad Waldrop, a real estate developer who is white. Mr. Waldrop is skeptical that the attempt by protesters to apply economic pressure will lead to broad reforms, because of all the municipalities and counties in the region that operate independently.

Some of the activists’ biggest victories have come at the expense of the police.

Officers have made more than 300 arrests, some of them questionable. They have swept up an undercover officer, an Air Force lieutenant, a reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and people who were not protesting. The newspaper published accounts of people who said the police struck or pepper-sprayed them after they had been taken to the ground.

The police took on more criticism when video captured some officers stealing a protest chant: “Whose streets? Our streets.” Chief O’Toole only made things worse when he later declared that the police had “owned tonight.” And many were outraged at a photo that showed a suburban police officer with his hand around the throat of an elderly black woman during a demonstration in a shopping mall.

The episodes have eroded trust in a force already struggling to improve community relations in a city trying to rein in its high murder rate, residents said.

“The Police Department has taken a black eye,” said Heather Taylor, a police sergeant here who is president of the Ethical Society of Police, the union representing black officers. “I think we’ve earned it.”

Ms. Krewson, who is white, made the unusual step of publicly criticizing her chief, calling his remarks inflammatory. She requested that the Justice Department investigate allegations of officer misconduct in their response.

“I hear them louder,” Ms. Krewson said of the protesters. “I understand them better because we’re living this day-to-day.”

Joe Reagan, the president of the St. Louis Regional Chamber of Commerce who is white, published an opinion piece in a local African-American newspaper urging swift police reforms to help the region’s economic health, and voiced support for an investigation.

“I think people are nervous about irreparable harm to the civic identity,” said the Rev. Starsky Wilson, a co-chairman of the commission created in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting.

If nothing else, said Mr. Wilson, who is black, the persistent protests should alert cities nationwide that people will not be satisfied by endless commissions and policy proposals that do not result in action.

“They’ll be back if you don’t take seriously their concerns,” he said.

Still, demonstrators are not declaring victory.

For as much as they have gotten Ms. Krewson’s attention, she has not heeded one of their loudest demands — to immediately replace Chief O’Toole, who is white, with a chief they believe would work better with the community.

Many of the changes they are asking for — more robust civilian oversight, a more diverse department, bridging racial inequalities — are fixes that will take time. And many familiar racial divisions remain: At a recent St. Louis County Council meeting over police pay raises, the pro-police crowd was largely white, applauding those who spoke in favor of officers but remaining silent when others advocated reforms.

“We haven’t seen any real, tangible, systemic change at all, from how the police are allowed to police us to how they’re allowed to engage with us during protests,” said Dhoruba Shakur, a 27-year-old black man, as he marched alongside a group of about 50 protesters on a recent evening with an AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder. “But we’re not done.”

There have been protests nearly every day since the verdict in the Stockley case on Sept. 15. The core group organizing the demonstrations cut their teeth in Ferguson and say they have adjusted their strategy based on their experiences there.

They focus on protests that cause economic disruption, often targeting white neighborhoods.

“We are bringing it to the doors of people who do not have to live this life and just giving that little bit of uncomfortableness,” said LaShell Eikerenkoetter, a protest leader who is black. “Now you understand what we as black folks feel and why we are out here.”

The demonstrations employ an element of surprise to throw off the police. They have attracted a diverse crowd and word is spread by live-streaming demonstrations online.

“Ferguson, we were driven off passion, anger. We were just flat out mad,” said Bruce Franks Jr., a state representative who is black, and who began his activism in Ferguson. “Now we’re mad, we’re still passionate, we’re still angry. But we concentrate heavily on strategy now.”

The demonstrations have made some people afraid to come to the city because they fear that there is chaos and that police officers are afraid to do their jobs, said Brad Waldrop, a real estate developer who is white. Mr. Waldrop is skeptical that the attempt by protesters to apply economic pressure will lead to broad reforms, because of all the municipalities and counties in the region that operate independently.

Some of the activists’ biggest victories have come at the expense of the police.

Officers have made more than 300 arrests, some of them questionable. They have swept up an undercover officer, an Air Force lieutenant, a reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and people who were not protesting. The newspaper published accounts of people who said the police struck or pepper-sprayed them after they had been taken to the ground.

The police took on more criticism when video captured some officers stealing a protest chant: “Whose streets? Our streets.” Chief O’Toole only made things worse when he later declared that the police had “owned tonight.” And many were outraged at a photo that showed a suburban police officer with his hand around the throat of an elderly black woman during a demonstration in a shopping mall.

The episodes have eroded trust in a force already struggling to improve community relations in a city trying to rein in its high murder rate, residents said.

“The Police Department has taken a black eye,” said Heather Taylor, a police sergeant here who is president of the Ethical Society of Police, the union representing black officers. “I think we’ve earned it.”

Ms. Krewson, who is white, made the unusual step of publicly criticizing her chief, calling his remarks inflammatory. She requested that the Justice Department investigate allegations of officer misconduct in their response.

“I hear them louder,” Ms. Krewson said of the protesters. “I understand them better because we’re living this day-to-day.”

Senate Approves Budget Plan That Smooths Path Toward Tax Cut

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
“This is the last, best chance we will have to cut taxes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Budget Committee, who warned that the consequences would be ruinous if the party failed.

“That will be the end of us as a party,” he said, “because if you’re a Republican and you don’t want to simplify the tax code and cut taxes, what good are you to anybody?”

Mr. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 1 a.m. to congratulate the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell — whose tensions with the president have been well-documented — for a “first step toward delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for the American people!”

Others were quick to condemn the blueprint. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, declared the budget to be “extremely cruel,” and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said it would burden the middle class.

“This nasty and backwards budget green-lights cuts to Medicare and Medicaid in order to give a tax break to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans,” Mr. Schumer said.

The Senate approved the budget blueprint after considering a flurry of amendments, a tedious process that gives the minority party an opportunity to force the majority to endure politically difficult votes. One Democratic amendment that was rejected sought to stop tax cuts from going to the top 1 percent; another would have restored cuts to Medicare.

The Senate approved the budget after a so-called vote-a-rama, a legislative whirlwind in which amendments are considered one after another. One proposal would have deleted language that could allow for drilling legislation; the amendment failed, 48 to 52.

“The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine areas of the United States, and we have been protecting it for decades for a reason,” said Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

But Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska and the chairwoman of the energy panel, said erasing the language would “deprive us of a substantial opportunity to benefit our country at the same time that we care for our environment.”

In Congress, the annual budget resolution provides an outline of federal spending and revenues. The Senate’s blueprint, for the 2018 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, claims to achieve a balanced budget within a decade, assuming greater economic growth and using an accounting method that excludes Social Security. In order to erase projected deficits, it calls for trillions of dollars in spending cuts over the coming decade.

But the cuts exist only on paper, without legislation to achieve them.

Even so, Democrats sounded the alarm, warning that the aspirational cuts in the budget plan called for slicing more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and about $470 billion from Medicare over a decade.

They also lamented the approach that Republicans are taking on taxes, which mirrors the strategy that they employed in their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On that matter, Republicans successfully laid the groundwork for a repeal measure that could pass without any Democratic votes, but party leaders could not ultimately get 50 Republican senators to agree on a health bill.

Though Democrats have pleaded to have more say in the tax overhaul, parliamentary language in the budget resolution would allow Republicans to pass a tax bill without any cooperation from the minority party. The tax measure could add as much as $1.5 trillion to budget deficits over a decade.

“Passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan. “Passing this budget is only a requirement to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible, without input or buy-in from members of the minority.”

For Republicans, the budget debate provided a moment to showcase their main goal in the coming months: Approving an overhaul of the tax code for the first time in decades, which they hope will lead to greater economic growth.

The House approved its budget resolution, which had long been stalled, on Oct. 5. The House budget also lays the groundwork for a tax bill, but, unlike the Senate’s approach, it calls for the legislation to not add to the deficit.

The House budget resolution also seeks more concrete action when it comes to cutting spending, instructing committees to come up with legislation that would produce at least about $200 billion in savings.

The chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, had seemed reluctant to jettison that piece of the blueprint. “What part of ‘cut spending’ does @SenateGOP not understand?” she wrote on Twitter last week. But Senate Republicans have shown no appetite to make spending cuts in tandem with the tax overhaul.

Unearthing a Massacre in Peru

Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Using DNA to Sketch What Victims Look Like; Some Call It Science Fiction
-Keywords-
['phenotyping', 'victims', 'dna', 'suspects', 'sketch', 'york', 'fiction', 'used', 'look', 'department', 'state', 'science', 'criminal', 'using']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Police officials have said they are focused on using phenotyping to help identify victims, though they have not ruled out using it to search for suspects.
Chief Katranakis said state approval was not necessary because the Police Department was not using the technique to identify specific individuals.
But the state Department of Health said Parabon is required to obtain a license to perform phenotyping on DNA samples from New York.
DNA collected from crime scenes is routinely used to identify suspects and to convict or exonerate the accused, usually by comparing it to a suspect’s DNA or samples in a criminal database.
Forget about it.”The Police Department’s announcement that it was using phenotyping came amid fresh controversy over forensic DNA techniques.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Parabon’s tests revealed that Monique was primarily of sub-Saharan African descent, and not white as investigators had believed based on the color of the skin found on her remains.

Analysts used her sex and ancestry to create a generic sketch of a face from a database of demographic information, which they overlaid with traits gleaned from her genes: a deep brown complexion and brown eyes above a round nose.

As murder rates hover at historic lows, the Police Department is looking to emerging technologies like phenotyping to help solve old cases. The hope is that seeing a victim’s likeness will jog people’s memories. Deputy Chief Emanuel J. Katranakis, the commander of the Forensic Investigation Division, said the police have received several tips since releasing the likenesses of Monique and a male victim in another case in September.

But critics have raised concerns about the lack of peer-reviewed science behind the technology and the creeping expansion of how DNA is collected and used in criminal investigations, where it is susceptible to human bias, error and abuse.

Police officials have said they are focused on using phenotyping to help identify victims, though they have not ruled out using it to search for suspects. But relying on so few traits requires the police to cast a wide net, said Robert Perry, the legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

“The problem is, its use will place actual people, innocent of wrongdoing, under criminal suspicion without any basis in fact or science,” he said.

Chief Katranakis said that criticism overlooks phenotyping’s ability to help the police avoid targeting the wrong people in their investigations. “The power of exclusion from phenotyping is greater than that of inclusion,” he said.

For example, he said, the Police Department used the technique to determine that the suspect in the 2016 murder of a Queens jogger, Karina Vetrano, was of African descent and eventually arrested a suspect, Chanel Lewis, who is black.

Dozens of law enforcement agencies in places like Louisiana and North Carolina have similarly used phenotyping to search for suspects in cases where investigators had exhausted traditional leads.

But New York regulators say any private lab seeking to perform testing on DNA samples from New York must have authorization from state health officials.

Chief Katranakis said state approval was not necessary because the Police Department was not using the technique to identify specific individuals. But the state Department of Health said Parabon is required to obtain a license to perform phenotyping on DNA samples from New York.

The agency sent Parabon a warning last month, and Ben Rosen, a Health Department spokesman, said the company is currently seeking a permit. In an interview, Dr. Steven L. Armentrout, Parabon’s chief executive, declined to comment on the issue.

DNA testing has been around for decades, popularized on television and in the criminal justice system for its usefulness in determining paternity and ancestry. DNA collected from crime scenes is routinely used to identify suspects and to convict or exonerate the accused, usually by comparing it to a suspect’s DNA or samples in a criminal database.

Increasingly, geneticists have been discovering ways to use variations to predict specific physical traits. The potential applications might someday include allowing doctors to detect genetic diseases by scanning a patient’s face.

Parabon boasts that its Snapshot service, which police officials said cost $4,000 to $5,000 for each case, “accurately predicts the physical appearance and ancestry of an unknown person from DNA.”

Although interest in its testing has grown, Parabon has yet to publish its detailed methodology for peer review.

Much of the science around how genetics determines facial appearance has focused on the role of individual genes. But Dr. Armentrout said Parabon’s facial predictions are based on its research on how genes work together to shape the face.

“For a complex trait, this is unequivocally the way genetics works,” he said.

But critics say the company is promising more than science has determined it can deliver. Dr. Yaniv Erlich, a computer science professor at Columbia University who studies genetics, said the idea that phenotyping could meaningfully predict something as complex as individual looks is “on the verge of science fiction.”

“Ancestry?” he said. “Sure, that’s fairly simple. Kinship, too. Phenotyping with faces? Forget about it.”

The Police Department’s announcement that it was using phenotyping came amid fresh controversy over forensic DNA techniques. The state inspector general is reviewing a request from criminal defense attorneys to investigate methods used for several years by the city medical examiner’s office, an inquiry that could have implications for thousands of prosecutions.

Among scientists, the idea that phenotyping can predict faces has provoked debate. A geneticist was criticized for a recently published paper in which he claimed to be able to identify anonymous people’s faces by sequencing their genes. Reviewers and a co-author said the paper, which was intended to raise privacy concerns, overstated what was achieved.

Dr. Erlich wrote that most of the trait predictions, such as height and face shape, were made using simple demographic data rather than trait-specific markers. “It is like the authors needed to get to the supermarket and decided to build a spacecraft to make the trip,” he said.

Even amid such debates, the role of DNA in criminal investigations continues to expand in New York. The state Commission on Forensic Science, which approves methods used in state crime labs, adopted guidelines for familial testing — DNA searches for relatives of potential suspects – that took effect Wednesday, despite protests from criminal defense and civil liberties lawyers.

The Legal Aid Society, in a brief filed with the commission, said that the panel, which was lobbied by the police, prosecutors and Ms. Vetrano’s family, does not have the authority to implement familial DNA testing.

Allison Lewis, a staff attorney in Legal Aid’s DNA unit, and David Loftis, the attorney in charge of post-conviction and forensic litigation, said the expanded roles of DNA in the criminal justice system in recent years go far beyond what the Legislature had in mind when it adopted laws compelling people convicted of certain crimes to submit swabs.

They warned that without clear rules from lawmakers, the technology will be used to justify something akin to stop-and-frisk, where people in black and Latino communities are targeted for genetic surveillance, regardless of whether they are suspected of a crime.

Chief Katranakis said the Police Department was “fully aware” of the uncertainty surrounding phenotyping. Officials conducted a thorough evaluation of the science behind it and consulted with industry experts before deeming it appropriate for use in a limited number of cases where investigators have nothing to work with, he said.

Nothing is what the police had when a man’s skull was found in July 2005 in a community garden in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The teeth had been removed, preventing investigators from identifying the victim with dental records. Phenotyping analysts created an image from his DNA and adjusted it to his skull shape, getting closer to what he looked like, Chief Katranakis said.

Investigators found the victim’s torso in a trash bin in East Williamsburg and traced it to 128 Gates Avenue in Bushwick, near where an accused serial killer lived when two of his teenage neighbors disappeared. Their bodies were found dismembered in 2004 and 2005.

The police are trying to determine whether the same suspect, Kwauhuru Govan, might be his killer.

9 Ways to Help You Become a Smarter Investor Image Credit Zach Meyer

Figuring out what is going on in financial markets isn’t easy, even for professionals who trade constantly. In fact, for many people, forgetting about day-to-day market swings and taking a long-term perspective may be the best approach.

Yet anyone saving for retirement or a house, a car or an education — or trying to amass a nest egg for any reason at all — needs to periodically check in to see where the financial world is heading.

The last several months have been particularly puzzling. Markets have continued to rise, despite geopolitical turmoil that might have set them back. To help you understand what’s happening and what to do, w e’ve pulled together some of the biggest issues in investing in a quarterly report.

Among the nine articles are analyses and explanations that provide an easy-to-understand introduction to investing (and perhaps amuse you along the way).

The Stock Market Charges Ahead, Despite the World’s Storms

Wall Street has responded to political turmoil and natural disasters with barely a shrug. The markets have been charging ahead, not just in the past several months but over the past eight years. Stock prices have risen and there are far fewer — if any — bargains, compared with the days right after the end of the financial crisis in 2009.

All of which raises a big question: What are the prospects for a continuing bull market — or a major decline?

The High Cost of Not Talking About Money

Money won’t buy happiness, but it can help. This is no mystery. Acquiring, accumulating and spending money often seem to be universal preoccupations in the modern world.

Yet despite the evident importance of money, conversations about it can be very uncomfortable on a personal level. Is an inability to talk openly and honestly about money and investments hurting you in the wallet? A new book argues that it is.

How Funds Manage Boatloads of Money

When funds attract heaps of fresh money, it can be a great thing for investors. A surge in new assets can create economies of scale that are passed along to shareholders, reducing costs and improving performance.

But that virtuous cycle doesn’t always happen. It is worth examining whether sudden inflows of cash have led to poor decisions by fund managers, hurting investor returns.

Where Do All the Disgraced C.E.O.s Go?

Richard F. Smith left Equifax in September after the company came under fire for a cybersecurity breach that compromised the personal information of potentially millions of consumers. Mike Cagney left Social Finance, the student loan company he had co-founded, after reports of allegations of sexual harassment and the company’s “frat house” culture. And then there is the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein , who was fired by his own company after years of allegations of sexual harassment and payoffs to accusers.

Chief executives seem to be stepping down from their posts — voluntarily or not — every day. Where do they go after they leave a scandal-ridden company? Here are some whimsical thoughts on a suitable destination for the besmirched.

Investing by Betting on the Sponsors of Sports

Invest in what you know: That’s an old mantra, and it makes a lot of sense. But what if what you know is, basically, sports?

If you’re not a billionaire and can’t buy teams or leagues outright, it will be difficult to invest in them directly: Most teams and leagues aren’t publicly traded.

So a sportscaster and a financial planner have started a new fund that enables avid fans to place indirect bets. This exchange-traded fund tracks companies that sponsor sports teams or broadcasters. The fund may be a comforting place for sports lovers to place their money, but buyer beware. It is largely untested.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Yet this latest incarnation of “Torch Song,” directed by Moisés Kaufman, finds an irresistibly compelling gravity beneath the glibness. Best known for staging lyrical but earnest topical dramas (“The Laramie Project,” “Gross Indecency,” “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo”), Mr. Kaufman turns out to be just the man for eliciting the sting within the soap bubbles of “Torch Song.”

Even more important, without overdoing the tremolo, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Urie make sure we see the vital links between camp comic postures and the genuine fear and pain that lie beneath. Defiantly quipping bravado is a suit of armor for Arnold Beckoff, the show’s leading man (and occasional lady).

That carapace has served him well. But sometimes it pinches. And as Arnold, Mr. Urie, who has become one of our most inspired physical comedians, digs deeper here to let us feel exactly where it hurts.

When we meet Ms. Ruehl as his mother (call her Ma) in the play’s second act, we experience the shock of recognition that occurs when longtime friends introduce us to their parents. “Oh,” we think, “so that’s where it comes from.” Embodied with carefully harnessed restraint by Ms. Ruehl, whose expert comic timing matches Mr. Urie’s, Ma loves her Arnold as only a mother can.

Photo

That’s especially true for a mother who sees her own image in her grown child as clearly as this one does. Which makes the differences between them — in this case, the little matter of Arnold’s being gay — take on the openhanded smack of betrayal.

The hour or so of entertainment that precedes this encounter is perfectly pleasant. It features one of the funniest simulated sex scenes ever (performed solo by Mr. Urie), not to mention some peerless aperçus. “A drag queen’s like an oil painting,” Arnold tells the audience. “You gotta stand back from it to get the full effect.”

Of course, what Mr. Urie does is let us see the brush strokes that went into this frame-worthy creation. And he shows Arnold’s ambivalence about letting others perceive the genuine fragility that he caricatures. This two-sided self-exposure is especially evident in his relationship with Ed (Ward Horton), a self-defined heterosexual with a taste for dalliance in the back rooms of gay bars.

It is at just such an establishment, the International Stud (a real place, and notorious in the pre-AIDS era), that Arnold meets Ed in 1974. Their passionate physical affair ends (sort of) when Ed announces he’s going to marry a woman, Laurel (Roxanna Hope Radja). Arnold, in turn, takes up with Alan (Michael Rosen), a streetwise young model and former hustler.

The erotic and psychological crosscurrents among this foursome occupy the play’s second part, which is its most contrived and least convincing. It’s in the extended third section that “Torch Song” reveals the tougher mettle of which it is made.

We are now in 1980. Arnold and Ed have been (platonically) reunited. And there’s a new guy in the picture: David (Jack DiFalco), a smart-mouthed gay teenager to whom Arnold has become a foster parent. Soon enough, Ma, fresh from Miami, arrives to assess this awkward ménage. And while Ma is as bright a joke maker as her son, there’s no question that it will end in tears.

Featuring astute, period-specific sets (by David Zinn) and costumes (by Clint Ramos) that summon the 1970s without winking nostalgia, this “Torch Song” has been impeccably assembled, with acting to match throughout. Mr. Horton, who wears Ed’s conflicts with a forthright air of denial, is the dream straight man (so to speak) to Mr. Urie’s flamboyant Arnold.

Mr. DiFalco adroitly avoids the perils of wise-child sassiness and brings a surprising and necessary flash of pain to the recollection of a gay hate crime. And Ms. Radja and Mr. Rosen make the most of what are ultimately throwaway parts.

But Mr. Urie and Ms. Ruehl take the show to a level of emotional truthfulness that makes objections to ungainly construction feel beside the point. Ma’s refusal to acknowledge the fact of Arnold’s homosexuality is given full validity in Ms. Ruehl’s uncompromising performance as a woman who avoids the truth by making a joke of it.

You know exactly where she’s coming from. And it’s that embracing spirit of understanding, grounded in a bedrock of family feeling, that comes to the surface so startlingly and movingly in this “Torch Song.”

Like the 2011 Broadway revival of Larry Kramer’s “The Normal Heart,” a later play about gay men that once seemed stuck in the past, Mr. Kaufman’s stirring production propels an ostensible period piece into a vibrant present. Emotions as strong as those brought to the surface here, you realize, never go out of date.

Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, often speaks about the need to protect the party against domestic and foreign enemies, and he has worked to strengthen the military and national security forces. He has presided over a withering campaign against critics: imprisoning scores of human rights lawyers, activists and journalists who have pushed for greater freedoms.

The security measures for the party congress show that Mr. Xi will not hesitate to use a “heavy hand on those who dare to exist with differing views,” said Frances Eve, a researcher for Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group.

“Left unchecked,” Ms. Eve said, “Xi’s vision of totalitarian control would see civil society eliminated and freedom of opinion and expression strangled.”

More than a dozen activists have been detained in recent weeks, according to rights groups. Dozens more have been harassed, placed under surveillance or forced to travel outside the capital.

One detained activist posted a video ridiculing Mr. Xi in crude terms. Another wrote songs paying homage to political dissidents like Liu Xiaobo, the jailed Nobel laureate who died in July.

Wen Donghai, a human rights lawyer in Changsha, a southern Chinese city, said he was called in for questioning by the police recently because he belonged to a social media group that circulated videos critical of the Communist Party.

“They control people without giving any reason,” Mr. Wen said. “All these talks are illegal.”

As part of the crackdown, the authorities have increased pressure on hundreds of aggrieved citizens who have made the journey to Beijing in recent days to file complaints about local corruption, pollution, unpaid wages and other issues.

Liu Minjie, 55, tried to file a complaint in September against the Supreme People’s Court in Beijing for decreasing the sentence of the man accused of murdering his son. Instead, Mr. Liu was detained and accused of “seriously disrupting social order.”

“He just wants to seek justice for my brother,” she said. “Now we are all worried.”

Beijing has become a model of state power as more than 2,000 delegates have descended on the city for the party congress, which began on Wednesday and will conclude next week. Security officials stand guard along busy intersections and armies of volunteer guards patrol neighborhoods.

Streets are adorned with feel-good posters praising Mr. Xi and the Communist Party. One declares that life is so good in China that “every day feels like a holiday.”

Protests are virtually nonexistent.

“We have no rights and no place to go,” said Li Ming, an activist who came to Beijing from Hunan Province to protest the poor quality of tap water, which he said had made him ill. “The police are everywhere.”

The government, wary of large crowds, has closed several nightclubs, restaurants and meeting halls. Drones have been banned in parts of the city, and sales of knives and scissors have been curtailed. To reduce the flow of outsiders to the capital, Airbnb and similar home-sharing services have been temporarily suspended.

The intense security has prompted grumbles among some Beijing residents. Subway lines have become excruciatingly long in some areas. Photographs have circulated online showing hundreds of people crowding outside stations.

“Skateboarding, boating or riding a horse might be faster,” quipped one user on Weibo, a popular microblogging site.

Many residents have been startled by the tactics. While the capital often employs strict security measures, the efforts underway for the party congress are especially severe.

Wang He was surprised earlier this month when she got a message saying she would be barred from renting her apartment on Airbnb.

“I thought I did something wrong,” she said. “I was so scared.”

Still, Ms. Wang said she planned to resume using the site once the congress ends. “They won’t block it forever, right?”

In defending Mr. Trump on Wednesday against claims by some plaintiffs that it was impossible to compete for business against the most powerful man in the world, a Justice Department lawyer played down his pull. “The president is a market participant,” said Brett Shumate, a deputy assistant attorney general. “He is not controlling access to the market.” But his participation in the market is part of the problem: Americans shouldn’t have to worry that their leader’s primary allegiance is to his own financial fortunes.

Mr. Trump gives little reason to feel reassured. In 2015, he said of Saudi Arabia: “I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me.” He added: “They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?” (On his first overseas trip after taking office, to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump lavished praise on the kingdom’s rulers, dismissing concerns about their repressive policies.)

Meanwhile, foreign officials are racing to curry favor with our businessman in chief. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, one diplomat told The Washington Post, “Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel, blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ ”

The case being heard Wednesday was filed days after Mr. Trump took office by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a bipartisan watchdog group. CREW’s complaint highlights the conflicts between Mr. Trump’s duties as president and his “vast, complicated and secret” web of business interests. These include Trump Tower in New York, where foreign-government-held entities like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China hold leases that will come up for renewal during Mr. Trump’s term, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where foreign diplomats pay top dollar to sleep, eat and do business with the United States. (Elected federal officials, including the president, are prohibited from holding the lease to the hotel, but that’s another story.)

Since the emoluments suit was filed, plaintiffs who complained of unfair competition in the hospitality industry have joined in. Meanwhile, two separate federal suits have also charged Mr. Trump with violating the emoluments clauses — one by nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress and the other by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.

A central question for the courts is the meaning of “emoluments.” Does the term cover only those benefits given in exchange for an official’s “personal services,” as the White House contends? Or does it apply to “anything of value” an official receives, as the plaintiffs argue? At Wednesday’s hearing, Judge George Daniels of Federal District Court appeared sympathetic to a broader reading, but was skeptical that the plaintiffs have standing to bring the lawsuit, because they had not shown concrete ways that Mr. Trump’s actions had directly harmed them.

Even if the case is thrown out on those grounds, Mr. Trump is still a walking emoluments-clause violation. And he still refuses to release his tax returns and other financial records, preventing the public from seeing the full extent of his business entanglements, debts and interests.

In this light it’s hard to see how the American people can ever be confident that Mr. Trump, who has spent a lifetime as a money-obsessed deal maker, is acting in the nation’s best interest, and not his own.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Auto plants in Australia have slowly been closing over the last several decades, with Ford, Toyota and now Holden, a General Motors subsidiary, shutting their manufacturing operations over roughly the last year.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Some blame the industry’s demise on the government’s refusal in 2013 to come to the rescue of the country’s automakers as they were battered by a high Australian dollar, high production costs and a shrinking domestic market.

Union officials estimated about 30,000 people lost their jobs as a result of the recent closures. In the area north of Adelaide, which has at times had South Australia’s highest unemployment rate and where Holden was the largest employer, nearly 1,000 people were left looking for work as a result of the automakers decision to cease production.

Leading politicians expressed dismay at the fate of the domestic auto industry.

“Personally, I feel very sad, as we all do, for the end of an era,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said during a radio interview on Friday. He added that the majority of workers in Elizabeth had either found new employment, decided to go back to school or retired.

But union representatives said most of the laid-off workers will never get work in the manufacturing industry again.

The average length of service among those at the plant was about 20 years, according to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, and the average age of those affected by the closure was about 38.

But John Camillo, the union’s secretary in South Australia, said it was the workers over 50 that were particularly struggling to find new employment.

“It’s difficult out there, especially here in Adelaide,” Mr. Camillo said.

The decision to stop making cars in Australia reflects “the perfect storm of negative influences the car industry faces,” Mr. Turnbull said. He pointed to the continued strength of the Australian dollar, high production costs, and a small domestic market that is both competitive and fragmented.

The small size of the domestic car industry made it almost impossible to compete against foreign automakers.

“It just didn’t reach the scale of operation,” said John W. Freebairn, an economics professor at the University of Melbourne. “You have to compete with the smart U.S. manufacturers, the Japanese, the South Koreans and so on who are producing several hundred thousand units a year. Our guys were nowhere near that.”

Holden devotees drove their cars through the town Sunday to commemorate “the end of an era.”

“Holden is one of Australia’s most iconic brands,” said Mark Bernhard, Holden’s chairman and managing director, in a statement. “We built the auto industry in this country and Australia grew up with Holden.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Since the president pledged in August to declare the opioid crisis a national emergency, he has been criticized for not following through. He added on Monday that he planned to make a “major announcement” on the subject next week.

In Williamsport, reactions were almost universally harsh.

“His hand got caught in the cookie jar,” Robert Gibbs, a retired shipping clerk and a Democrat, said of Mr. Marino.

Residents described how drugs had changed the city. Local hospitals treated 51 overdoses in a 48-hour period in June. A juror on a smoking break outside the county courthouse called Williamsport “little Philadelphia” because of its drug problem. Adrienna Snyder, a postal worker, said businesses on her downtown route now lock their restrooms to keep people from dying in them.

State Senator Gene Yaw, a Republican from Williamsport, who has been a leader in the Legislature on opioid issues, said the strong Republican lean of Mr. Marino’s 10th District might not be enough to ensure his re-election if he seeks a fifth term next year.

“The drug problem is nonpartisan,” Mr. Yaw said. “There’s no question the pharmaceutical companies have contributed to it.’’ He said the controversy over Mr. Marino’s withdrawal from consideration to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy was “not a plus” for his political future.

Mr. Yaw sponsored a bill in Harrisburg, the state capital, to restrict how many pain pills doctors can prescribe at once. It is meant to limit the amount of opioids in circulation — the opposite of what critics say is the effect of the legislation Mr. Marino promoted in Congress, known as the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act.

Mr. Marino issued a statement on Tuesday expressing pride in the 2016 law, which passed by acclamation in the House and Senate and was signed by President Barack Obama.

He criticized the news media for distorting the bill, which he called “landmark legislation” that balances the needs of patients for pain medicine with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s powers to stop abuse.

On Sunday, a joint investigation by The Washington Post and “60 Minutes” revealed how the drug industry had worked behind the scenes with Mr. Marino on the law, helping to draft its language, hiring former D.E.A. lawyers as consultants and showering $1.5 million in donations to Congress.

The law weakened the D.E.A.’s power to stop prescription opioids from being shipped to rogue doctors and pharmacies suspected of corruptly distributing them. A flood of narcotics to “pill mills” has been a major cause of the opioid crisis. Many people who became addicted to prescription pills have turned to heroin since the authorities began tightening access to legal opioids.

On “60 Minutes,” a former top D.E.A. enforcement official, Joseph T. Rannazzisi, said, “I just don’t understand why Congress would pass a bill that strips us of our authority in the height of an opioid epidemic in places like Congressman Marino’s district.”

In his statement, Mr. Marino referred to Mr. Rannazzisi as “the subject of a professional conduct investigation” whose “assertions may be motivated by financial self-interest.”

Mr. Marino’s largely rural district, which stretches in a northern arc from the Susquehanna Valley to the Delaware Water Gap, on the New Jersey border, has been drawn to favor Republicans. Mr. Marino, a former county and federal prosecutor, who was one of Mr. Trump’s earliest supporters in Pennsylvania, won his race last year in a landslide.

A Democratic opponent, Judy Herschel, who is a drug and alcohol abuse counselor, has announced a challenge in the district next year, and the contrast ads over opioids seem inevitable.

Still, Michael Allison, a political scientist at the University of Scranton, said it was too early to know if Mr. Marino’s re-election prospects would suffer. He noted Mr. Marino first won his seat in 2010 even after resigning as a United States attorney under the cloud of a Justice Department investigation. Federal agents were looking into his role in helping to win a casino license for an accused mobster.

William Carlucci, 62, a lawyer in Williamsport, predicted that Mr. Marino would win easily if he ran. “I think he’s well liked,” he said.

Mr. Carlucci, who does commercial litigation, was conferring on the courthouse steps with his adversary in a case, Megan Wells.

Ms. Wells, 30, described Mr. Marino’s role in the controversial legislation as a case of “the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Her law firm represents the interests of a neighboring county in cases in which children are removed from the custody of parents with drug addictions. “We are seeing an astounding number of grandparents stepping in to take custody,” she said. “Things are worse now than they’ve been. It’s just so pervasive.”

In April, the Guyanese-American real estate mogul Edul Ahmad was convicted of mortgage fraud and sentenced to two years in prison. He had cooperated with authorities in the conviction of the New York Senate leader, John L. Sampson, a Democrat from Brooklyn who has Guyanese heritage.

“In Queens, you find a replica of the bribery and corruption from Guyana,” said Aubrey Bonnett, a professor at the State University of New York at Westbury who has written about the West Indian diaspora. “It’s a miniature part of the subculture.”

Since gaining independence from Britain in 1966, Guyana has been politically divided between two major ethnic groups, African and Indian. Mr. Bisram and his family are of Indian heritage; the current ruling party in Guyana is mostly made up of Afro-Guyanese leaders.

More than 80,000 Guyanese, mostly Indo-Guyanese from the Berbice farming region, now live in the contiguous Queens neighborhoods of South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill and Jamaica, according to the city’s Department of Planning.

Mr. Narinedatt and Mr. Bisram went to the same school in Berbice. At an early age, Mr. Bisram’s parents separated. He moved in with his grandmother, and his aunts also took care of him.

“We were all poor,” said Dawanti Pariag, one of Mr. Bisram’s aunts, outside the extradition hearing last month. “He know what’s hardship, because he didn’t grow up with parents since he was 3 and 4.”

At 16, after finishing high school in Guyana, he joined his father in Queens, she said.

Mr. Bisram later went to the Allen School of Health and Sciences in Jamaica, Queens, for a nursing degree to be a home health aide, his lawyer said. He did not go to Hunter College, as was stated on the Marcus Brian Bisram Foundation website, which recently was deactivated.

How a 20-something home health aide came to be the wealthy head of a philanthropic foundation is a bit of a mystery, even among those closest to Mr. Bisram. According to Mario F. Gallucci, Mr. Bisram’s New York lawyer, Mr. Bisram met a benefactor whom Mr. Bisram declined to name. Even Mr. Gallucci said he does not know whether the benefactor is alive or dead.

“He receives a salary, and as part of his salary, which is very generous, he has taken it upon himself to donate to causes he sees fit in Guyana,” Mr. Gallucci said. “His benefactor, or his employer, agrees with his decisions where he donates the money.”

His aunt, Ms. Pariag, said that she never asked him where his money came from, but considered her nephew to be “blessed.”

Mr. Bisram started his foundation in the spring of 2016, and he pledged to donate $1 million per year (the equivalent of $200 million Guyanese dollars) to organizations in his country.

There, the Bisram Foundation has built orphanages and repaired the traffic office of a local police precinct; it donated to community policing groups, blood banks, a cricket team and laid-off sugar workers; it has given backpacks to poor students. Because of his wealth, Mr. Gallucci said, Mr. Bisram has “dignitary status,” and is given a security detail by the local police when in Guyana.

The fateful party of last Oct. 31 coincided with Mr. Bisram’s philanthropic mission to Guyana, and community police officers — to whom Mr. Bisram was donating — were among the guests. Mr. Narinedatt was living in No. 70 Village, awaiting immigration documents that would allow him to join his wife in New York. He was one of about 150 people at the party, according to Mr. Bisram’s Guyanese lawyer. The entire village was invited.

According to the police report, one witness, a 16-year-old cousin of Mr. Bisram, saw Mr. Narinedatt drinking rum along with other partygoers. When Mr. Narinedatt went to urinate in the backyard, the witness said, Mr. Bisram fondled his genitals. Mr. Narinedatt slapped him in the face five times. The witness, according to a police report, then heard Mr. Bisram issue the order to kill Mr. Narinedatt, using the local slang: “You all done he.”

Guyana police reports included two witnesses who saw five men beating Mr. Narinedatt; one witness saw the men throw Mr. Narinedatt into the trunk of a car. The victim was found on the side of the No. 70 Village Public Road after 4 a.m. on Nov. 1. At first, the police considered his death a result of a hit and run. But Mr. Narinedatt’s relatives said they suspected that it was staged.

By then, Mr. Bisram was in New York, his return flight “preplanned,” according to his lawyer.

Frustrated by the slow response from local authorities, Mr. Narinedatt’s uncle Abdool Rizam Shafeek, said he went to officials in the capital of Georgetown two weeks later.

“You had a lot of covering up here, in Berbice, a lot of covering up from the first set of police who handled the matter,” Mr. Shafeek said in an interview in Guyana. “At one time they were claiming it was an accident, but when you look at the body, it wasn’t an accident.”

Mr. Narinedatt, according to the coroner’s report provided to the Guyanese police, had multiple skull fractures, a fractured spine and arm, along with a ruptured spleen and liver and pulmonary contusions. He also had alcohol in his system.

In the months after the party, and then after Guyana issued a warrant for his arrest, Mr. Bisram lived a very public life, giving winter coats to the needy, accepting humanitarian awards and socializing with friends at Queens restaurants and bars.

On the afternoon of July 4, Mr. Bisram was preparing for a holiday party at his five-bedroom, three-story beach house in the Rockaways that he purchased in 2015. His aunt, Ms. Pariag, recalled that she was making Guyanese “cookup rice,” when U.S. marshals came to arrest him.

We spoke to a few local bagel shops and asked them to weigh in on what makes a classic New York bagel.

• It “should be crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside,” said Melanie Frost, the chief operating officer at Ess-a-Bagel, in Midtown East. And they should be hand-rolled, she added.

• “They should always be boiled, never steamed,” said Philip Romanzi, owner of Bagel Hole in Park Slope, where they use malt syrup instead of sugar.

• Niki Russ Federman, the co-owner of Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side, knows what a New York bagel is not. “It should not be sweet and you should never find blueberries, jalapeños, or rainbow colors in your bagel.”

• For Adam Pomerantz, the owner of Murray’s Bagels in Greenwich Village, New York bagels must have a hole and a generous amount of seeds on both sides, if the recipe calls for them. They should also be slightly well done. “A bagel should be a bit of struggle to bite into,” he said. “That’s what a true New York bagel is all about.”



How would you describe a real New York bagel? And what bagel place in the city do you think gets it right? Let us know in the comments.

Dear New Jerseyans,

Do you have a question you’d like to ask your next governor before the election on Nov. 7? Perhaps it’s a statewide problem that you encounter every day — maybe it’s about schools, jobs or health care. Or maybe it’s more specific, like your commute to work, legalizing marijuana or your property taxes.

We want to gather readers’ questions in hopes of getting responses for you — yes, you.

This race — its two leading candidates are Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, a Republican — marks the end of Gov. Chris Christie’s tumultuous tenure and has the potential to shift the governor’s seat from red to blue.

Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve, Hot or Cold, Set the Pace in the A.L.C.S.
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Altuve was not the only reason the Astros won the first two games of this series, each by a 2-1 score.
Over all, he is now batting .313 (5 for 16) in the A.L.C.S., and his on-base-plus-slugging percentage has soared to 1.263.
He’s a complete player,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said of Judge.
No less an authority than Reggie Jackson, a Yankees special adviser who has worked closely with Judge, cast an unofficial vote in an August interview.
“I’d probably vote for Judge,” he said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Altuve was not the only reason the Astros won the first two games of this series, each by a 2-1 score. Dallas Keuchel, who shut out the Yankees on four hits over seven innings in Game 1, and Justin Verlander, who had 13 strikeouts in his complete-game victory the next day, had more than a little bit to do with it.

Photo

But Altuve collected five hits in eight at-bats in those games, scoring two of the Astros’ four runs, stealing a base to set up one of those runs and generally playing with the kind of energy that made the Yankees appear somewhat flat-footed.

Altuve was the runner who barreled down on catcher Gary Sanchez at the end of Game 2, scoring the winning run all the way from first base as shortstop Didi Gregorius’s one-hop throw squirted out of Sanchez’s glove.

“We like to put pressure on teams,” Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. “Altuve really ran well around the bases when the ball was hit.’’

Judge went 1 for 7 in the first two games of the series, drawing just one walk and striking out three times, although his lone hit would have counted as a tying single in Game 1 if Greg Bird had not been thrown out at the plate. Judge’s meager output was a continuation of his struggles in the first-round of the postseason, when he went 1 for 20 with 16 strikeouts against the Cleveland Indians.

But starting in Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, when Judge slammed into the right-field wall to make a running catch in the top of the fourth and then lined a fastball into the left-field seats in the bottom of the inning, the fortunes of the two players, and their teams, have been reversed.

In the Bronx, Judge has come alive at the plate, with a big home run and a double that ignited the Yankees’ comeback in Game 4 and another run-scoring hit in Game 5. Over all, he is now batting .313 (5 for 16) in the A.L.C.S., and his on-base-plus-slugging percentage has soared to 1.263.

Photo

Judge also made one of those plays that generally goes unnoticed, charging in from right field to take the final throw in a rundown that snared Yulieski Gurriel after his bases-clearing double had given the Astros a 3-0 lead in Game 4.

“He is not just a hitter. He’s a complete player,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said of Judge. “He’s a great defender. He’s a great base runner. He understands that the little things win you games.”

As Judge has surged, Altuve’s productivity has plummeted, along with that of the rest of the Houston lineup. He was hitless in the three games at Yankee Stadium, going 0 for 10 with three walks and a strikeout. His A.L.C.S. batting average is down to .278 from .625, and his on base-plus-slugging percentage has dropped to .659 from 1.250.

In those three games, the Yankees outscored Houston by a total of 19-5.

Back to the vote for the most valuable player. No less an authority than Reggie Jackson, a Yankees special adviser who has worked closely with Judge, cast an unofficial vote in an August interview. For Altuve.

“I’m partial to the kid Altuve, who is a 5-foot-4 guy, 5-foot-5 guy, but a giant of a player,” Jackson said on the MLB Network. “We have a guy on our ball club, Aaron Judge, who in time I think has a chance to develop into that special type of player that Jose Altuve already is.”

And before this series started, Altuve cast his own unofficial ballot.

“I’d probably vote for Judge,” he said. “Because he hit a lot of homers, a lot of R.B.I.s, he got on base a lot, and I like the way he plays.”

The results of the M.V.P. vote — the official ballots were cast before the postseason — will be announced next month. The contest between the Yankees and the Astros will be over by Saturday at the latest, and considering the way it has gone so far, either Altuve or Judge might be the player to settle it.

Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety?

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Alarmed, Jake’s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

Photo

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

Before walking back to his dorm, where Jake’s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A’s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake? He hadn’t bothered to show up.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
It’s when we get to the social world that things really get gnarly. A lot of our thinking is for bonding, not truth-seeking, so most of us are quite willing to think or say anything that will help us be liked by our group. We’re quite willing to disparage anyone when, as Marilynne Robinson once put it, “the reward is the pleasure of sharing an attitude one knows is socially approved.” And when we don’t really know a subject well enough, in T. S. Eliot’s words, “we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts,” and go with whatever idea makes us feel popular.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Back when they wrote the book of Proverbs it was said, “By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.” These days, a soft tongue doesn’t get you very far, but someday it might again.

Or maybe not. In the midst of this sonic dismay, Pallbearer works like contractors hired by Black Sabbath and HGTV to renovate doom’s underground bunker, by installing major-scale emergency exits and unexpected, lovely chord changes that function as skylights. (Who says you can’t be heavy while standing in the sun?) While some doom purists may resent the gentrification, Pallbearer’s facility with melody, song structure and heart-on-your-sleeve singing has kept it inching toward the edge of crossover success, which is a strange place for a doom band to be.

Categorizing Pallbearer as prog-rock makes its commercial situation slightly less novel, and is appropriate to its ambitious compositions. (As the critic Michael Nelson has noted, many of its songs manage to be catchy without having choruses.) But no matter where you file its records, Pallbearer still honors doom’s prime directive: Make it heavy. When I asked a friend who studied music theory to explain why certain moments on “Heartless” sounded so powerful, his answer included “DRAMA,” “churchy,” “gravy,” “LOW” and “sweet, thick feeling.”

The guitarists Devin Holt and Brett Campbell play in drop-A tuning, which means fifths and octaves ringing in low registers. Their fastest songs still feel burdened. Though the classic pop chords at the end of “An Offering of Grief” are uplifting, the fact that C, G, F and the gang are slowly crashing down at 64 b.p.m. means you’ll probably never hear them in a Toyota commercial, unless Toyota starts selling cement mixers. Like all those records I played at the wrong speed, Pallbearer’s leave space to soak in each chord, even if you can’t see to the bottom.

At its best, Pallbearer’s infusion of fresh harmonic blood into doom’s turgid circulatory system is exhilarating. The emotional power of a pivot to a B-flat major chord during “Lie of Survival” kept surprising me, until I realized it reminded me of one of my favorite moments in sacred music: the climactic hallelujahs in Edward Bairstow’s 1925 setting of “Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence.” Indeed, when I saw Pallbearer perform in the spring, I was struck by the sight of headbangers with eyes closed and arms upraised, swaying like megachurch attendees coming down with the holy spirit. And as the band pounded through the wordless opening of “A Plea for Understanding,” a chord progression of punishing melancholy that seems sweetly protective of its A-major home, I realized I was on the verge of tears.

Granted, it had been an exhausting few months. I had already fallen into the unhealthful habits of mistaking my dread for integrity and of confusing skimming the news all day with civic engagement. At that concert, Pallbearer’s despairing optimism and go-for-broke sincerity felt like a moral rebuke to the doom I’d grown too comfortable with. As the crowd threw its fists in the air, as the band continued pummeling away at one of the most resonant emotional campaigns in American rock music, as our horizons expanded, I was happy to be recruited — to believe, finally, in the audacity of doom.

Mr. Kelly also had harsh words for Ms. Wilson and accused her of turning Sergeant Johnson’s death into a political stunt.

Mr. Kelly said he and the congresswoman were both at a 2015 ceremony for a new F.B.I. building in Miami that was named after fallen agents. Mr. Kelly said Ms. Wilson took credit for getting the funding for the building. Ms. Wilson’s congressional district includes parts of Miami.

“And we were stunned — stunned that she’d done it,” Mr. Kelly said. “Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.”

Ms. Wilson said she had pushed for naming the building after two fallen F.B.I. agents but never took credit for obtaining the funding to build it. The money was secured before she was elected to Congress in 2010, she said.

“He didn’t tell the truth and he needs to stop telling lies on me,” Ms. Wilson said of Mr. Kelly on Friday.

The White House stands by Mr. Kelly’s account, a spokesman said on Friday.

In another Twitter post on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that Ms. Wilson was “SECRETLY on a very personal call,” and “gave a total lie” about what the president said.

Ms. Wilson, a friend of the Johnson family, was in a limousine with the family waiting at Miami International Airport to meet Sergeant Johnson’s coffin when Mr. Trump called. Ms. Wilson heard the call because it was on a speakerphone.

Regulator Blasts Wells Fargo for Deceptive Auto Insurance Program
-Keywords-
['deceptive', 'insurance', 'program', 'complaints', 'wells', 'report', 'fargos', 'blasts', 'office', 'bank', 'regulator', 'comptrollers', 'auto', 'fargo']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Last year, the comptroller’s office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo.
For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo’s oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance.
Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.
Wells Fargo’s auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said.
Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
That internal report said the costs of the unneeded insurance, which covered collision damage, had caused some 274,000 Wells Fargo customers to fall behind on their car loans, and almost 25,000 vehicles were wrongly repossessed. Customers on active military duty were among those hurt by the practice.

In the comptroller’s report, regulators said management at the bank’s auto loan unit, Wells Fargo Dealer Services, had ignored signs of problems in the business such as consumer complaints, focusing instead on sales volume and performance. The report described its management of compliance risk — essentially the ability to abide by regulations and best practices — as “weak.” It noted that Wells Fargo in 2015 had characterized the risks associated with this business as “low.”

Wells Fargo has set aside $80 million to compensate the 570,000 customers it said were harmed by receiving auto insurance they didn’t want. The comptroller’s office said that the amount was inadequate and that the bank might have to pay out substantially more as additional victims were identified — partly because Wells Fargo’s analysis of how much money it needed to set aside excluded many years when the insurance was being imposed.

The report does give Wells Fargo’s management credit for taking action after identifying the problems at the auto loan unit, such as hiring legal and consulting firms to assess customer harm, changing staff at the operation and notifying regulators.

The comptroller’s findings are likely to affect how Wells Fargo does business, not just in the auto lending operation but across the bank. The comptroller’s office said it would require Wells Fargo to ensure that all of its business units had effective systems in place to identify and prevent risky practices.

Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement that the bank had made significant changes in recent months to strengthen controls and oversight of insurers and outside vendors with which it does business.

“We are also working to enhance our customer care program and improve complaints resolution,” she said. “We will continue to work with regulators on the remediation and make improvements to our auto lending business to build a better Wells Fargo.”

Wells Fargo stopped the auto insurance program in September 2016.

Once the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency makes its findings formal, Wells Fargo will have time to correct the problems. A spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office declined to comment on the report.

The report did not mention penalties or fines. The comptroller can impose penalties for violations of laws or unsound business practices in an attempt to deter violations and encourage corrective measures.

Last year, the comptroller’s office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo. A report in April by the office’s ombudsman concluded that the agency “must continue our efforts to improve and refine the agency’s supervisory program, to sharpen our early warning processes, and to enhance our supervisory capabilities.”

The comptroller’s review of Wells Fargo’s auto lending and insurance practices has been underway for several months.

The report paints a damning picture of a bank that didn’t monitor its contractors, that lacked the impetus to correct problems once they were uncovered and that proved unresponsive to complaints from its customers.

For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo’s oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance. National General was not obligated to — and did not — alert Wells Fargo to customer complaints about the unneeded insurance, the report said.

And when auditors at Wells Fargo detected and then flagged problems with National General in 2015, the comptroller’s office said, the bank didn’t act on those concerns promptly.

Christine Worley, a spokeswoman for National General, disputed elements of the report. “We believe that our customer service in this area was handled in a timely manner,” she said in a statement. “We work closely with our financial institution clients and advise them of complaints on a regular basis.”

The bank’s lapses in handling consumer complaints and managing vendors are not new. Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Wells Fargo’s ability to track consumer complaints efficiently, for example, had been part of a 2015 compliance-improvement plan at the bank, the report noted. And a so-called consent order in 2011 between Wells Fargo and the comptroller’s office involving the bank’s mortgage foreclosure operations required it to establish a more effective program to manage its relationships with outside companies and contractors.

The comptroller’s office also concluded that the bank’s plan to compensate customers who were harmed by the improprieties was insufficient. When calculating potential damages, the bank limited its payments to customers who were affected beginning in January 2012 and extending to July this year. But the auto insurance program has been in place for almost 12 years, and the bank didn’t calculate potential damages caused for much of that period.

“The number of customers harmed in this time period could be substantial,” the report said.

Wells Fargo also used “an overly complicated reimbursement methodology which lacked clear support for addressing all the customer costs incurred,” according to the report.

Wells Fargo’s auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said. For example, the bank did not break out the insurance costs embedded in car loans; rather, it included the amounts owed on the unneeded coverage in the monthly payments. Had borrowers known what the cost increases were for, the comptroller’s office said, they could have taken action more quickly to avoid harm.

Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges. The comptroller office’s review of loan files and consumer complaints showed that Wells Fargo’s customers often had to submit proof of coverage multiple times before the coverage was canceled.

Will Mitch McConnell Help His Friend Get a Health Care Deal?

The subsidies, estimated at $7 billion this year, were challenged in federal court by the House in 2014 and found unconstitutional because Congress had not approved them. Mr. Trump announced last week that he was cutting them off and Mr. Alexander said he feared millions of people could now find insurance out of their financial reach.

Despite the serious negotiations, there was no firm commitment that a compromise would reach the Senate floor if one could be struck. In fact, Mr. Alexander deferred to Mr. McConnell last month when Mr. McConnell wanted to take one last shot at overturning the health care law. He broke off his talks with Ms. Murray, resuming them only when the repeal effort faltered once again.

All sides agree that Mr. Trump — in conversations with Mr. Alexander and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader — strongly encouraged the bipartisan talks and initially seemed to embrace the agreement to restore the subsidies as a way to buy time for another repeal push. So backers of the plan were blindsided when the president said on Twitter on Wednesday that he could not back what he considered an insurance industry bailout.

Mr. Schumer said the president was undercutting himself by wavering on deals he had helped set in motion, not just on health care but also on issues like immigration. Mr. Schumer suggested that Mr. Trump caved to conservative opposition to the health care compromise.

“This president cannot govern if whenever the hard right frightens him and says, ‘Jump,’ he says, ‘How high?’” Mr. Schumer said.

Backers of the compromise face a tough task in selling the idea to many Republicans who would now be voting not to repeal the health care law, but to temporarily prop it up to avoid a breakdown in the marketplace. In addition, many on Capitol Hill say the compromise could be an important first step toward stabilizing the overall program, making future attempts to repeal it even more difficult.

Mr. Trump’s view will be crucial. His endorsement could provide important political cover for those nervous about voting to bolster the health care law while his opposition could cause Republicans to flee, fearing they will come under attack from the president and his allies.

Mr. Alexander is not retreating. Trying to build momentum, he and Ms. Murray introduced the legislation on Thursday along with two dozen leading Republican and Democratic co-sponsors — an almost unheard-of event on a major bill in this highly polarized environment.

Among Republicans backing the measure were Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, long active in health policy; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the authors of the most recent repeal plan; Bob Corker, Mr. Alexander’s Tennessee colleague who has been feuding with the president; and the group who thwarted Republican repeal efforts, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I don’t believe Congress will want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue,” Mr. Alexander said.

He and Ms. Murray said that they had built in protections to make sure the money went to consumers and that it was a mischaracterization to call it an industry bailout. They said both sides gave substantial ground in the talks. Ms. Murray told fellow Democrats this week that it was the toughest bargaining she had been involved in as a senator.

“It sends a powerful message that when members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done,” Ms. Murray said of the negotiation.

But to a large degree, the ultimate success of the talks depends on Mr. McConnell. He has been quiet so far about the bill and whether he would push it forward. The Senate would no doubt have to give it a strong vote for the plan to have any chance of moving through the House.

The support from a growing list of Republican co-sponsors is no guarantee that the Senate will consider the bill if Mr. McConnell views it as too politically risky. He refused to bring to the floor last year a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul that had broad support because of political considerations — despite the fact that Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, was a chief author.

Mr. Alexander has repeatedly predicted that some version of his new legislation will become law by the end of the year. For him to be proved right, he is going to need some help from his good friend Mitch McConnell.

Aminata lost her father and a grandmother, an aunt and several cousins. Other patients at the eye hospital said their immediate families had been wiped out.

Many survivors suffer from “post-Ebola syndrome” — debilitating muscle and joint pain, headaches, fatigue, hearing loss and other lingering ills, sometimes even seizures.

A Virus That Lurks in the Eye

Like the patients he is now trying to help, Dr. Crozier was blinded in one eye by uveitis and recovered — but then lost his sight a second time, to a cataract. He had surgery in March.

His eye disease, described on May 7, 2015, in The New England Journal of Medicine, put the world on alert. Nearly two months after he had seemingly recovered from Ebola, and after his blood was free of it, severe uveitis suddenly developed — and Dr. Yeh was stunned to find that the fluid inside Dr. Crozier’s eye was teeming with active virus. At that time, uveitis was also emerging in West Africa.

Even though the virus may still lurk inside the eye in survivors with uveitis, it is not on the surface or in tears, so patients cannot spread Ebola through casual contact. But operating on them might pose a risk to surgeons who open the eye.

Eventually, the immune system seems to eliminate the virus, but no one knows how long that takes. Eighteen months after the virus was first found inside Dr. Crozier’s eye, a repeat test was negative. But when the virus level actually dropped is not known.

Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health and Sanitation was eager for Emory’s help, according to Dr. Kwame Oneill, who manages its Comprehensive Program for Ebola Survivors.

“After Ian became ill and had complications, he became a pioneer, a rallying point,” Dr. Oneill said. “Ian’s story was the turning point for survivors.”

The eye hospital in Freetown also welcomed the researchers. Dr. Lowell Gess, who founded the hospital in 1982, had recognized that uveitis was a severe problem in many patients. In 2015, during the epidemic, Dr. Gess, who was 94, began alerting Ebola treatment centers to the condition and recommending medications for it.

How many survivors have eye trouble is not known. Many live in far-flung provinces and have lost touch with health authorities. But a volunteer group, the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors, has tried to find patients who need help, and has helped pay for travel and lodging so they could consult the doctors from Emory. By this past summer, the Emory team had seen about 50 Ebola survivors with cataracts, from 5-year-olds to people in their 60s.

At first, it was quirky in the Seattle way: Jeff Bezos, an oversize mailbox and his little online start-up. His thing was books, remember? How quaint. How retro. Almost any book, delivered to your doorstep, cheap. But soon, publishers came to see Amazon as the evil empire, bringing chaos to an industry that hadn’t changed much since Herman Melville’s day.

The prosperity bomb, as it’s called around here, came when Amazon took over what had been a clutter of parking lots and car dealers near downtown, and decided to build a very urban campus. This neighborhood had been proposed as a grand central city park, our own Champs-Élysées, with land gifted by Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder. But voters rejected it. I still remember an architect friend telling me that cities should grow “organically,” not by design.

Cities used to be tied to geography: a river, a port, the lee side of a mountain range. Boeing grew up here, in part, because of its proximity to spruce timber used to make early airplanes. And then, water turned the industrial engines that helped to win World War II.

The new era dawned with Microsoft, after the local boy Bill Gates returned with a fledgling company. From then on, the mark of a successful city was one that could cluster well-educated people in a cool place. “The Smartest Americans Are Heading West” was the headline in the recent listing of the Bloomberg Brain Concentration Index. This pattern is likely to continue, as my colleagues at the Upshot calculated in picking Denver to win the Amazon sweepstakes.

At the bottom of the brain index was Muskegon, Mich., a place I recently visited. I found the city lovely, with its lakeside setting, fine old houses and world-class museum. When I told a handful of Muskegonites about the problems in Seattle from the metastatic growth of Amazon, they were not sympathetic.

What comes with the title of being the fastest growing big city in the country, with having the nation’s hottest real estate market, is that the city no longer works for some people. For many others, the pace of change, not to mention the traffic, has been disorienting. The character of Seattle, a rain-loving communal shrug, has changed. Now we’re a city on amphetamines.

Amazon is secretive. And they haven’t been the best civic neighbor, late to the charity table. Yes, the company has poured $38 billion into the city’s economy. They have 40,000 employees here, who in turn attracted 50,000 other new jobs. They own or lease a fifth of all the class A office space.

But median home prices have doubled in five years, to $700,000. This is not a good thing in a place where teachers and cops used to be able to afford a house with a water view.

Our shiny new megalopolis has spawned the inevitable political backlash. If you think there’s nothing more annoying than a Marxist with a bullhorn extolling a failed 19th-century economic theory, put that person on your City Council. So Seattle’s council now includes a socialist, Kshama Sawant, who wants “the public” to take over Amazon ownership. Other council members have proposed a tax on jobs. Try that proposal in Detroit.

As a Seattle native, I miss the old city, the lack of pretense, and dinner parties that didn’t turn into discussions of real estate porn. But I’m happy that wages have risen faster here than anywhere else in the country. I like the fresh energy. To the next Amazon lottery winner I would say, enjoy the boom — but be careful what you wish for.

A 'Soulful Journey' in a Family Photo Album

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor.
When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Stars glitter and worlds collide in Todd Haynes’s “Wonderstruck,” a lovely ode to imagination and to the stories that make us who we are. A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.

Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.

Photo

Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.

“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.

Video

Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.

Rich Lowry in National Review:

“It might be the stupidest and most unworthy controversy of the year, and that’s saying something.”

According to Mr. Lowry, the uproar on both sides of the aisle over this issue is misguided. Mr. Trump may have been right that President Obama didn’t call each family of a fallen soldier, but he was nonetheless wrong to “use that point as a bludgeon.” Mr. Lowry adds that while the president’s reported comments to the family of Sergeant. Johnson sounded “horrible in isolation,” there’s no way to properly judge without hearing the entire phone call in context. Moreover, Mr. Lowry believes that controversies over condolence calls should be entirely left “out of our poisonous political debate.” Read more »

From the Left

Brandon Friedman in The New York Daily News:



“There’s often a misconception among non-veterans that service members sign up with the expectation that they may die. But I can tell you: I did two tours in combat as an infantry officer and I never met a soldier who thought dying was a reasonable result of his or her service.”

If the president did indeed tell Sergeant Johnson’s widow that her husband “knew what he was signing up for” in his call, then, according to Mr. Friedman, he has a poor grasp on how the military actually works. Mr. Friedman, who served two tours of duty and worked in the Obama administration, explains that since the Sept. 11 attacks one out of every 5,000 service members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan died on duty. “This makes it clear that dying in combat is neither common nor expected,” he argues. What “keeps troops going,” he explains, is the faith that your government, and your commander in chief, believe that soldiers’ lives are valuable. “No one shrugs death off as an inevitability.” Read more »

Ameer Hasan Loggins in The Guardian:

“I fully empathize with the family of Sergeant La David Johnson. [...] Sadly, the lack of respect given to them is not an American aberration. It is a part of this country’s ugly history regarding black people and the military.”

When Mr. Loggins heard reports of what Mr. Trump had said to Sergeant Johnson’s family, he recognized it as the latest in a long string of moments black veterans were shown disrespect. Mr. Loggins points out that black troops have disproportionally experienced military punishment — up to, and including, the death penalty. Read more »

Margaret Hartmann in New York Magazine:

“The ongoing dispute over Trump’s treatment of Gold Star families runs the risk of overshadowing a more significant concern: More than two weeks after the attack, we don’t really know what happened in Niger.”

Ms. Hartmann notes that in all the attention paid to the condolence call controversy, most outlets and readers have missed a much more important story: the uncertain events from an attack in Niger that left four soldiers — including Sergeant Johnson — dead. In this piece, she outlines what is known and what questions still remain. Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Leonid Bershidsky in Bloomberg:

“The U.S. demands even more ceremony of its presidents than other countries in part because of the expectation that the head of state is also the moral-authority-in-chief where Christian leadership is prized and the president is expected to channel those attitudes.”

Mr. Bershidsky takes a broader view in his column by examining the symbolic, or ceremonial, function of a U.S. president and how President Trump may or may not fulfill this role. He explains how in other countries, ceremonial duties such as honoring soldiers who have died falls to a monarch or other governmental figurehead. In the U.S., he notes, policy and ceremony fall to the same person, for better or for worse. Read more »

How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition — they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.
There is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat.
In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow.
But like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five.
But here’s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Because today’s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don’t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition — they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.

There is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat. Although it is one of the most innovative consumer-focused internet companies — Snap created a whole new paradigm in social networking, and pioneered the idea that the camera is the future of human communication — it has been battered by the giants.

After failing to buy Snap several years ago, Facebook repeatedly tried to copy its key innovations. This year, when Facebook lifted Snapchat’s Stories feature for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook’s main app, it seemed to deliver a death blow.

But Facebook isn’t the only behemoth trying to feed off Snap’s carcass. In January, Snap signed a cloud hosting deal with Google. It agreed to pay Google $400 million a year for the next five years. Note that Snap booked only about $330 million in ad revenue in the first half of this year. In other words, it’s paying more than half of its revenue to Google.

Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.

The small guys won’t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don’t have the whole game won.

They said the Five’s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five’s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren’t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.

“In a lot of ways I’d say it hasn’t changed,” said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. “I’ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, ‘Why won’t Microsoft do your business?’ Then six years later it was, ‘Why doesn’t Google do it?’ Now it’s a combination of why can’t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?”

Mr. Levin’s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller’s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.

Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day’s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.

IAC’s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five — both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.

Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that’s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys — for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms — because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.

“We think that a smart voice provider will say, ‘If I want to win at all costs, we’ll go get the very best partner’ — and that’s us,” Mr. Terrill said.

In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn’t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It’s not betting on their demise; rather, it’s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.

IAC’s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. “I think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,” Mr. Terrill said.

I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi — who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia — whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.

“I’m mixed as it relates to that,” he said. “I fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers — and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.”

In August, Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed chief executive of Uber, where he will have to deal with the giants more directly. Though his company is the most highly valued start-up of our age, its success seems far from assured. Many of its problems are of its own making, and Mr. Khosrowshahi is determined to fix them.

But like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet’s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.

The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here’s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.

Moving across the bottom of the grid, you know very well that a nightstand belongs at the side of a bed. It’s a plural clue, and you know that calls for a plural answer, which is BEDSIDES. Write that in there at 61A, and drop in that tortured soul, AHAB, at 50D. That southeast corner? Also yours. It’s just a matter of coming back to fill the rest in.

You’ve been doing this long enough that you can smell a pun a mile away, especially when the clue has a “?” at the end. At 33A, read the clue “Things non-PC people buy?” carefully. You don’t believe that Mr. Wentz is talking about someone who is not politically correct for a second, do you? Of course you don’t. It’s clearly a clue about computers. A non-PC person — someone who doesn’t use a personal computer — buys MACS. There’s your eastern entry. Math types might capture the west with ARCSINE at 33A.

And, of course, blacksmiths wear APRONS. There’s your northwest.

I’ve been following the stories about the hacker group known as Anonymous enough to know that their symbol is a GUY FAWKES MASK, so I was able to write that right across the center of my puzzle. It’s O.K. if you don’t know that. That’s what crossings are for, and now you do know it.

BADA BING. One Friday puzzle started. Now you crush the rest of it. You’ve got this.

Tricky Clues

15A: Ha-ha, you know what else fits here? STAR WARS, although we all know that’s not the right answer. “1999 prequel that grossed over a billion dollars, familiarly” is EPISODE I, but I’m proud that I was at least in the right series.

19-/20A: I had Y_ _D_ for 20A (“Things to 19-Across”) and guessed that the answer was YARDS. That gave me MOW for 19A, which is clued tersely as “Cut.”

38A: At first, this clue/answer pairing bothered me, but after I thought about it, I realized what it was trying to say: “Dated women?” for FAIR SEX just means that the term FAIR SEX is a dated term for women. I am now re-sheathing my weapon.

56A: Congratulations to HODA KOTB for making her full name debut in The New York Times Crossword.

11D: SCABS are the people who cross a picket line to take the place of striking workers, which is why they are the “Sources of labor pains?” Ha-ha, very clever, Mr. Wentz. You know what’s not funny? Seventeen hours of back labor. Source: The Boy.

Constructor Notes

It’s pretty rare that I build a puzzle around a single, central marquee entry, but if there were ever to be such a case, GUY FAWKES MASK is about as good as I can muster. It must have been deemed too tricky for the Friday audience, but I had my fingers crossed that the original clue of “Anonymous symbol?” would make the final cut. My clues have been saved on many past occasions by the editorial team, so I can certainly respect their judgment. Maybe this is a late makeup for my “Stone work” clue for J.F.K. on a Thursday puzzle all those years ago ... Rest of the puzzle appears to hold up, even if the quadrants are a little closed off. They all feel pretty smooth, but maybe could have used another splashy modern entry or two. Perhaps a little more crossword glue might’ve done the trick. It’s always tricky to strike the right balance. Hope it’s a pleasant solve regardless. Happy puzzling!

The first sign of unsettlement is when Carl starts bringing mismatched chairs to Jody’s shop, where the play takes place, claiming his own apartment is too small. As the chairs progressively take over the space, we learn that Jody has stopped going home. He hasn’t been tested, he tells Carl, and does not want to leave the comfort of his familiar, mapped-out little universe anymore.

Mr. Dietz never says what Jody has not been tested for, but the two protagonists are gay men in the early 1990s, and conclusions are easy to draw that it is AIDS. This is par for the course in “Lonely Planet,” which makes liberal use of symbols and metaphors, yet manages to be heavy-handed while not spelling things out.

Most obviously, Jody uses cartography to evoke the way he sees the world, as when he talks about the flat Mercator map — which misrepresents the size of countries, with those farther away from the Equator appearing larger — and makes us accept “the distortion as fact.”

Jody is also seen reading Ionesco’s absurdist, despairing, agonizingly elliptical play “The Chairs.” “Is it the one with the hippos?” Carl quips. But under his flip exterior — and Mr. McGrath makes hay of Carl’s wit — the show’s resident jester is angry at the disease that is killing his friends.

The chairs he is amassing in Jody’s store belonged to people who just died; they are totems of snuffed-out lives. At least Carl confronts the plague in his own way, and he is getting frustrated and scared by Jody’s denial of reality.

In the plain, affectless staging by Jonathan Silverstein, Mr. Burton and Mr. McGrath expertly underplay the characters, with their roiling fears and, in Carl’s case, outrage. You may wish, at times, for a dash of immoderation, but the show’s deceptively gentle approach is also what makes it stand apart in our angry times.

The Fed Claims to Be Independent. That’s Mostly a Myth.
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.
The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis.
As President Trump thinks about whether to choose a new Fed leader, Ms. Yellen, whose term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy.
Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernanke’s unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats.
And President Trump’s rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Fed’s financial crisis response.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul. Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both. Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher.

Congress is also more likely to act when electoral rewards are greatest. If one party controls both the White House and Congress, voters know whom to reward or blame. If the parties divide power, voters have a harder time.

Congress is more likely to threaten action than to take it. Using legislative records to document lawmakers’ attention to the Fed, we examined all the bills introduced in the House and Senate between 1947 and 2014 that address the power, structure and governance of the central bank. Over nearly seven decades, 333 House and Senate members introduced 879 bills.

Fingers Point at the Fed When the Economy Misfires Higher unemployment is correlated with the number of congressional bills between 1947 and 2014 addressing the power and governance of the Fed. 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0

Viewing the number of bills introduced each year (1947-2014) in the context of when the unemployment rate was above its median makes the pattern clear. When the economy hums, lawmakers leave the Fed alone. For example, congressional attention dropped markedly during Alan Greenspan’s Great Moderation starting in the 1980s, when the Fed tended to achieve its mandates. When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.

The Fed today remains caught in the cross hairs of partisan polarization. Republican proposals to limit its discretion, for instance, would require the Fed to adopt rate-setting monetary policy rules. Others want greater transparency from the Fed, such as allowing auditors to review monetary policy deliberations. Even though the current Fed is still occupied by Obama appointees, Democrats are also critical, favoring stronger limits on emergency lending.

Threats matter because they restrict Fed autonomy. Fed officials understand that responsiveness, sometimes even deference, to their congressional bosses lessens the chance that Congress and the president will revise the Federal Reserve Act.

Photo

Critics in Congress take aim at both monetary goals and tools. In July, the House financial services chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, warned Ms. Yellen that the Fed should cease and desist from buying assets that venture into fiscal policy: “If we are not careful, we may wake up one day to find our central bankers have instead become our central planners.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Fed’s 2012 adoption of an inflation target also belies any notion of Fed independence. Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, first broached the subject with his colleagues a decade earlier. Fed transcripts reveal acute sensitivity to securing congressional support. As Donald Kohn, then the Fed vice chairman, argued in 2008, “having an inflation target won’t have any effect if it is repudiated by the Congress.”

In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, the perceived political risk of setting a target again deterred Fed action. The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis. Even today, when former Fed officials recommend a higher inflation goal to generate greater growth, G.O.P. lawmakers direct Ms. Yellen not to change the target. Perhaps the Fed would be less eager to raise interest rates again if it could independently raise the inflation bar instead.

A decade after the financial crisis and near generational lows in unemployment, the Fed is finally unwinding its four-plus-trillion-dollar balance sheet, gradually raising interest rates and keeping an eye on inflation that has been below the desired target.

This Fed seems eager to drop Mr. Bernanke’s crisis prescriptions. At her September news conference, however, Ms. Yellen reminded market participants that future policy makers would have a free hand to follow the Bernanke playbook the next time the country faces a financial crisis. Rates could return to zero, the balance sheet could be expanded, and so-called forward guidance could provide clear communication about future policy.

Political interdependence cautions against such certainty. Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernanke’s unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats. And President Trump’s rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Fed’s financial crisis response.

A new Fed, backed by an expanding economy, may temporarily quiet the legislative critics. But whether in this presidential term or some later one, an inevitable economic slowdown — or a more serious financial panic — will surely restart the cycle of crisis, blame and reform.

But being a nonagenarian long-distance runner was altogether different.

At 91, she ran the 2014 San Diego marathon in 7 hours, 7 minutes and 42 seconds — faster by nearly two hours than Mavis Lindgren’s official United States record for a woman of at least 90.

“She didn’t stop, she didn’t go to the bathroom,” said her son, who is known as Brenny and who ran with her in marathons and other races.

A year later, when her time in the San Diego race was 7:24:36, she became the oldest woman known to have finished a marathon. She did so while wearing white tights to cover the open wounds on her legs from radiation treatments for squamous cell carcinoma. Over the last seven years she had also dealt with a recurrence of oral cancer, which first struck her in 1986.

“I kept hearing, ‘Go Harriette, go Harriette!’ ” she told “CBS This Morning” after the race, adding: “I remember seeing this stuff falling down. They had confetti. Like Lindbergh — I had a ticker-tape reception.”

In all, her running at the San Diego marathon raised more than $100,000 for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, a national charity.

Music — including favorites like Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in D major — played in her head when she ran, helping her through monotonous stretches of the course.

Harriette Brenneman Line was born on March 27, 1923, in Carlisle, Pa. Her father, J. Harvey Line, was a lawyer, and her mother, the former Harriet Brenneman, was a homemaker who taught her daughter to play the piano. An athletic girl who wanted to get places quickly, young Harriette preferred running, bicycling and roller skating to walking.

She attended Dickinson College in her hometown before receiving a music scholarship to attend Syracuse. She married Sydnor Thompson Jr., a lawyer and judge, two hours after they both graduated in 1947.

Throughout her life Ms. Thompson maintained her focus on music as she raised her children. She taught piano at Boston University and earned an artist’s diploma from the Vienna Conservatory. She performed at Carnegie Recital Hall (now Weill Recital Hall) and on the cruise ship Queen Elizabeth II. She received a master’s in music from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, and played benefit concerts at the Aspen Chapel during the summers she spent in Aspen, Colo.

When she moved to a retirement community, she brought her Bösendorfer concert grand with her.

In addition to her son Brenneman, Ms. Thompson is survived by another son, Sydnor III; three daughters, Darcy Howard, Harriet Moore and Katherine Kelly; and 11 grandchildren. Her husband died two years ago.

Ms. Thompson ran two five-kilometer races recently and in June returned to San Diego, where she jogged and walked a 13.1-mile half-marathon. She was such a crowd favorite that she had to be protected from well-wishers by family members. Women wanted to take selfies with Ms. Thompson. Meb Keflezighi, a New York City and Boston Marathon winner, stopped by to marvel at her, as did a former mayor of San Diego, Jerry Sanders.

Ms. Thompson was told repeatedly that she was an inspiration, prompting her to remark, “If at this age I can do anything positive, that’s wonderful.”

She looked down and smiled. She took her time, and then, with her chin still lowered, she raised her eyes to look kindly at the student.

“I’m going to answer your question,” she said, “but you have to promise me that the next time you meet a new father, you ask him how he’s balancing his work and the responsibilities of fatherhood.”

The young man shrugged. Adichie, who is 40, smiled warmly at him, but thereafter, the class, already intimidated and shy, grew only more so.

“Why don’t I read a bit?” she said finally, and she did.

AFTERWARD, ADICHIE and I sat at a restaurant in Columbia Heights. “He was quite sanguine, wasn’t he?” she said about the young man she’d carefully corrected. “Maybe he’s young enough that he hasn’t been indoctrinated into the cult of how and when to take offense. He can still look at the merits of an argument. Either that, or he was looking pleasantly at me and thinking, ‘Bitch, go away.’ ”

Adichie looks with a gimlet eye at American liberal doctrine, preferring open and frank debate to the narrow constraints of approved messaging. Though she is considered a global icon of feminism, she has, on occasion, displeased progressive sects when she’s expressed her beliefs about gender with candor and without using the latest terminology.

“It’s a cannibalistic ethos,” she says about the American left. “It swiftly, gleefully, brutally eats its own. There is such a quick assumption of ill will and an increasing sanctimony and humorlessness that can often seem inhumane. It’s almost as if the humanity of people gets lost and what matters is that you abide to every single rule in the handbook of American liberal orthodoxy.”

The day was not warm, but we ordered lemonade. Moments later, the waiter said they needed our table for a large party. We moved into a corner and the waiter forgot about us completely. Which seemed improbable, with Adichie’s glittering bag on the table serving as a kind of tabletop lighthouse.

“I’ll have you know,” she said, “that this bag was designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first woman creative director at Dior. A very interesting person. When she proposed the T-shirt, she sent me a handwritten note.”

I asked if Dior planned to make merchandise for every one of her books. Maybe a necklace that said “The Thing Around Your Neck”? A sconce that said “Half of a Yellow Sun”? Adichie laughed her distinctive laugh, which overtakes her whole torso but sounds like the giggle of a teenager. I should note here that I’ve known Adichie for about 10 years now, and she has always been startlingly easy to make laugh, and one of her very favorite subjects for ridicule is the exalted reputation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

She grew up in an upper-middle-class home, the fifth of six children. Her father was a professor at the University of Nigeria, her mother was the university’s registrar — the first woman to hold that post. Her parents expected Chimamanda to be a doctor, and for a year she studied medicine at university, but her heart wasn’t in it.

“When I said I wanted to write, they were very supportive, which was very unusual,” she said. “Nobody just leaves medical school, especially given it’s fiercely competitive to get in. But I had a sister who was a doctor, another who was a pharmacist, a brother who was an engineer. So my parents already had sensible children who would be able to make an actual living, and I think they felt comfortable sacrificing their one strange child.”

Adichie was just 26 when she published her first novel, “Purple Hibiscus,” in 2003. It won the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize for Best First Book. Her second, 2006’s “Half of a Yellow Sun,” was a shimmering work of historical fiction that reminded the world of the Biafran War and made it deeply personal; it won the Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (now called the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction) and garnered comparisons to one of her heroes, Chinua Achebe. The next year, she won a MacArthur grant and found time to finish a master’s degree in African studies at Yale. “The Thing Around Your Neck,” her first collection of stories, was published in 2009, followed by 2013’s “Americanah,” an intimate and accessible multigenerational story about family and immigration set in Nigeria and New Jersey. It won the National Book Critics Circle Award and has become an enduring best seller. While the majority of her previous work had been tightly controlled and gravely serious, “Americanah” was loose and irreverent.

“I decided with that book that I was going to have fun, and if nobody read it, that would be fine,” she said. “I was free of the burden of research necessary for the other books. I was no longer the dutiful daughter of literature.”

In “Americanah,” the protagonist, a Nigerian woman named Ifemelu, moves to New Jersey and is first confused and then amused by the cultural differences between African-Americans and Africans living in America. Ifemelu decides to explore the subject in a blog called Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black. Through the blog, Adichie was able to speak with disarming forthrightness about life as an African living in America: “I was tired of everyone saying that when you write about race in America, it has to be nuanced, it has to be subtle, it has to be this and that.”

The directness of the blog, I suggested, seemed to provide a bridge to her TEDx Talk, which became a book, which became a T-shirt and a bag.

“Yes and no,” she said. “But I’ll allow your thesis.” She laughed her laugh.

Now there is a follow-up called “Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions.” Asked by a friend, a new mother, for advice in making her daughter Chizalum a feminist, Adichie wrote another (very direct, lucid) work. Suggestion No. 1 reads, “Be a full person. Motherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.” No. 8: “Teach her to reject likability. Her job is not to make herself likable, her job is to be her full self, a self that is honest and aware of the equal humanity of other people.” And No. 15: “Teach her about difference. Make difference ordinary. Make difference normal. Teach her not to attach value to difference.”

The reaction to these manifestoes among a reading public longing for probity and directness has been profound. In a San Francisco auditorium last year, I witnessed Adichie step onto the stage in front of almost 3,000 people — the average age of the audience was about 20. She wore ankara-patterned pants and a white blouse and stood on four-inch heels, and the audience response was euphoric.

“It’s not that I told people something they don’t know, it’s just that I did it in language that was more accessible.” She looked around the restaurant. “But I don’t think we’re ever going to get our lemonade.”

ADICHIE AND HER HUSBAND, a physician, spend half of each year in Maryland, and the other half in Lagos, where they have a home and where her extended family lives.

In Nigeria, Adichie is considered a national icon, not only because her books have garnered such acclaim, but because quickly after her success she founded the Farafina Trust Creative Writing Workshop, a program where aspiring Nigerian writers spend a few weeks every year workshopping with Adichie and a coterie of international writers she brings to Lagos. She invited me to teach there in 2009, and I got the chance to meet her family and friends, all of whom were supportive, kind, funny, devoted — it was all sickeningly perfect.

One night, it became the obsession of one of the guest lecturers, the Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina, to bring Adichie to one of Lagos’s seamier nightspots. He asked her where that would be. She had no idea. “I’m a nice middle-class girl,” she said, laughing. “I don’t know about such places.” She was serious, though. She did not know.

So we called Adichie’s childhood friend Chuma. He suggested Obalende, a district of Lagos known for its nightclubs and strip clubs. Chuma picked us up and drove us to a neighborhood where fish and plantains were fried on the street, where the air was swampy with weed. He chose a club with a slanted roof of corrugated steel and Fela bursting from the sound system. We sat outside on a humid night, Adichie game but wide-eyed. We were visited by a street musician who would not leave. Adichie requested Fela’s “Unknown Soldier” and he played it, and we stayed late, and most of us got tipsy — even Adichie; she had one drink — and at the end of the night, I was the only one fit to drive, which I did, which everyone thought very funny, especially when we were pulled over by a traffic cop, who wanted a bribe. I did what I always do in that situation, which was to act like the world’s dumbest tourist, and it worked. He let us go, and Adichie, in the back seat, laughed all the way home.

A FEW MONTHS after her appearance at Cardozo high school, Adichie was on a rooftop in downtown D.C. It was breezy and the sky threatened rain. She had agreed to attend a book release party celebrating a collection of essays called “Having to Tell Your Mother Is the Hardest Part,” written by D.C. public school students, with guidance from tutors from 826DC, a nonprofit youth writing organization with which I’m affiliated.

A tent had been set up, and cocktails were served, and a young African-American man stepped to the podium. He was delicately built for 15, wearing a mustard-colored button-down, a tie and thick-framed glasses.

“When I was 2 years old, my mom and dad passed away,” the boy, whose name was Edwyn, read. “I was in and out of foster homes and was never in really good care. The way I used to grieve was by not eating or by fighting, and I always got in trouble. I would get angry whenever someone said, ‘Yo mama.’ I felt like I wanted to hurt someone. I have gotten past that, and now, I want to take my meds so I can grow emotionally and become a better me. I decided to try group vigils where I can talk about my loss, but it has never helped. I refused to share until, one time, I broke down and shared everything.”

The audience on the rooftop stood spellbound. I looked over to Adichie. Her eyes were wet. Edwyn continued. In a group home, he said, he almost stabbed another boy. He almost flunked out of school. Finally, he was adopted by a loving family who moved him to Washington. “I was starting to mature,” he read. “I started to change. Now I’m in the 10th grade, writing about how I used to grieve, but I am happy with the family I am with.”

His essay ended like that, and he sat down with the unaffected attitude of a student who had just read a paper about meiosis or the Louisiana Purchase. Afterward, we approached Edwyn, who was now surrounded by admirers. He shook Adichie’s hand like a cocktail party veteran, telling her he’d heard a lot about her and was happy she was there.

“I thought you were very brave,” Adichie said evenly.

Word of Adichie’s presence on the roof began making its way through the attendees. Another student, a gregarious young woman named Monae, approached. “I didn’t know you were here!” she said. “You were the one in Beyoncé’s song!” (A few years ago, Beyoncé sampled parts of Adichie’s “We Should All Be Feminists” talk in her 2013 song “Flawless.”)

“You have to read what I wrote!” Monae said, and gave Adichie a copy of “Having to Tell Your Mother Is the Hardest Part,” opened to a spread bearing her smiling face and her essay, titled “Queen.”

We made our way to a quiet part of the rooftop and watched the adults swarm the student-writers, getting their books signed.

“That is lovely,” Adichie said. “Just lovely.”

After the party, we said goodbye on the corner of Pennsylvania and 17th. Adichie’s parents were in town, visiting from Nigeria, and she had to get back to Maryland.

“That boy,” she said, and sighed. She was still thinking about Edwyn. “There was something so clean and pure and true about his writing, don’t you think? Increasingly I find that that’s the kind of thing I want to read.”

Dr. Solanto said the study all but ruled out adult-onset A.D.H.D. as a stand-alone diagnosis. Other experts cautioned that it was too early to say definitively, and noted that attention deficits often precede mood and substance abuse problems — which in turn can mask the condition.

The new analysis drew on data from a decades-long study of childhood A.D.H.D. that had tracked youngsters from age 9 or 10 up through early adulthood, gathering detailed histories from multiple sources, including doctors and parents.

That project, begun in 1994, recruited 579 children with diagnosed A.D.H.D., as well as a group of 289 in the same classrooms for comparison purposes.

Of those “control” youngsters, the new study found, 24 would go on to develop attention deficit problems much later on, during high school or after. Classic A.D.H.D. is diagnosed between ages 5 and 12.

View all New York Times newsletters.

The authors of the new report, led by Margaret Sibley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health at Florida International University, carefully examined the extensive records of those 24 with adult-onset A.D.H.D. The researchers found that the attention deficits in all but five cases most likely stemmed from other causes, like marijuana use, depression or anxiety.

And the remaining five were hardly straightforward cases: One subject had previously had an eating disorder, another had shown signs of mania.

“This suggests to me the diagnosis doesn’t exist independent of a compelling psychiatric history,” said Dr. Sibley. “No one in our group developed A.D.H.D. in adulthood out of nowhere.”

Some 10 percent of children are given a diagnosis of A.D.H.D., and most grow out of it to some extent. One reason that symptoms may emerge seemingly from nowhere in high school or later, experts say, is that some youngsters have offsetting abilities, like high I.Q., or supports, such as sensitive parents or teachers, that mask the problems early on.

In this respect, upbringing and environment may effectively blunt or contain symptoms.

Not all experts believe the new report is the last word.

“When we take out all those people who have complicating problems, like substance use and mood disorders, we still find that about a third of late-onset cases remain,” said Jessica Agnew-Blais, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.

She was co-author of a previous study that estimated the prevalence of adult-onset A.D.H.D. at about 6 percent. “What this discrepancy points to is that it’s important to look at different populations,” Dr. Agnew-Blais said of the new findings.

“I don’t think clinicians should be shutting the door, if the only sticking point is the age of onset of symptoms,” she added.

Danielle Darrieux, French Film Star Over 8 Decades, Is Dead at 100
-Keywords-
['dead', 'young', 'star', 'ms', 'later', 'danielle', 'film', 'career', 'french', 'france', '100', 'decades', 'darrieux', 'hollywood', 'musical']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Ms. Darrieux became an international film star in Anatole Litvak’s “Mayerling” (1936), playing the teenage mistress of Rodolfo (Charles Boyer), crown prince of Austria, in a retelling of the Habsburg tragedy.
Back in France, directors who had grown up adoring Ms. Darrieux clamored to work with her.
Perhaps more qualified for the role than her predecessor, because she was both French and a singer, Ms. Darrieux was nevertheless in awe of Hepburn.
She was, Ms. Darrieux said in interviews, the only person she ever asked for an autograph.
Ms. Darrieux was known for keeping her private life private, and when she gave interviews she tended to be modest.

She said decades later that her favorite role was that of the hero’s matronly mistress in “Le Rouge et le Noir” (1954), based on Stendhal’s novel about class-conscious post-Napoleonic France.

It was well known that Ms. Darrieux’s favorite director was Max Ophuls. After “La Ronde,” her first collaboration with Ophuls, they worked together in “Le Plaisir” (1952), about prostitutes on a country outing, and “Madame de … ” (1953), released in the United States as “The Earrings of Madame de … ,” a tale of jewelry, debt and infidelity.

Ms. Darrieux became an international film star in Anatole Litvak’s “Mayerling” (1936), playing the teenage mistress of Rodolfo (Charles Boyer), crown prince of Austria, in a retelling of the Habsburg tragedy. American critics praised both her beauty and her performance. She was only 19, and it was her 19th film.

Her new stardom was ratified by a timeless phenomenon: women around the world copied her hairstyle. “Danielle Darrieux appears with her hair bundled on top of her head in ‘Mayerling,’ ” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times in 1938, reviewing another film entirely. “And a few months later, all the girls are building bird’s nests in their tresses.”

Ms. Darrieux had an abbreviated chance at Hollywood stardom, traveling to the United States in 1937 and signing a contract with Universal. She was soon cast as a young woman looking for a rich husband in “The Rage of Paris” (1938), which also starred Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Louis Hayward.

But after dipping her toe in the Hollywood waters, she declined to plunge in, returning to France immediately after making “The Rage of Paris” and, pleading illness (“ill health resulting from nervous strain,” The New York Times reported), delayed her return. Again and again.

Photo

By the time she made her next American movie, she was in her 30s and, by Hollywood standards, ready for older-generation roles. She was cast as Jane Powell’s long-lost mother in “Rich, Young and Pretty” (1951). In 1956 she played Richard Burton’s mother (although she was only eight years his senior) in “Alexander the Great.” In between she starred in Joseph Mankiewicz’s espionage drama “Five Fingers” (1952), as the Polish love interest of a British spy (James Mason).

Back in France, directors who had grown up adoring Ms. Darrieux clamored to work with her. Claude Chabrol cast her in “Landru” (1963) as one of a Blackbeard-like character’s victims. Jacques Demy’s musical comic drama “Les Demoiselles de Rochefort” (1967) was one of several occasions when Ms. Darrieux played Catherine Deneuve’s mother; among the others was François Ozon’s 2002 all-star musical whodunit, “Huit Femmes” (“8 Women”), about a household with only one man in it, a dead one.

No one ever had to dub Ms. Darrieux’s voice in a movie musical. She recorded and sang dozens of songs onscreen over the decades, most recently Charles Trenet’s “La Folle Complainte” in the 2006 film comedy “Nouvelle Chance,” in which she played an alcoholic.

With and without music, Ms. Darrieux had a long and varied stage career in France, taking on dozens of roles in works by Noël Coward, Françoise Sagan, Feydeau and other playwrights. She played the ultimate older woman in a 1995 French production of “Harold and Maude” and capped her stage career in 2003, at 86, as the star of “Oscar et la Dame Rose,” Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt’s tale of an elderly hospital worker helping a dying boy. She won the Molière, France’s national theater award.

Ms. Darrieux appeared on Broadway twice. In 1970 she replaced Katharine Hepburn in “Coco,” the Tony Award-nominated musical about the fashion designer Coco Chanel. Perhaps more qualified for the role than her predecessor, because she was both French and a singer, Ms. Darrieux was nevertheless in awe of Hepburn. She was, Ms. Darrieux said in interviews, the only person she ever asked for an autograph.

Ms. Darrieux’s only other Broadway appearance was in the short-lived musical “Ambassador,” with Howard Keel, in 1972.

Danielle Yvonne Marie Antoinette Darrieux was born on May 1, 1917, in Bordeaux, France. Her father, Jean Darrieux, an ophthalmologist who was serving in World War I when she was born, died when she was 7. She grew up in Paris, where her mother, the former Marie-Louise Witkowski, gave voice lessons to make ends meet. Danielle studied cello at the Conservatoire de Musique.

She was only 14 when she auditioned for and won a role in the film “Le Bal” (1931), playing an upwardly mobile couple’s neglected daughter whose behavior drives the plot.

Her early stardom was a mystery to her. “Maybe I succeeded because my type wasn’t commonplace on the screen,” she was quoted as saying in “Noir & Blanc: 250 Acteurs du Cinéma Français 1930-1960,” by Olivier Barrot and Raymond Chirat (2000). “I mean that I was simply a young girl, while other 14-year-olds were already playing the vamp.”

In her early film career, she was directed in “Mauvaise Graine” (1934), a drama about car thieves, by a young Austrian immigrant who soon left for Hollywood: Billy Wilder. Aside from her brief Hollywood visits over the years, Ms. Darrieux stayed home, becoming eternally associated with a string of films that remained relatively unknown in the United States, among them “Battement de Coeur” (1940), “Premier Rendez-Vous” (1941), “La Vérité sur Bébé Donge” (1952) and “Marie-Octobre” (1959).

Photo

Ms. Darrieux was a chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur and an officer of the Ordres des Arts et des Lettres, but she never won a César Award, the French equivalent of the Oscar. She received an honorary César in 1985, as if her career were over, but then went on to be nominated twice — for André Téchiné’s “Scene of the Crime” in 1987 (at 70) and for “8 Women” in 2002 (at 85).

She continued acting well into her 90s, making nine films in the first decade of the 21st century. Her last big-screen appearance was in “Pièce Montée” (2010), a comedy about a family wedding. She also appeared in a 2011 television movie, “C’est Toi C’est Tout,” playing a Corsican grandmother.

After her death, France’s minister of culture, Françoise Nyssen, posted on Twitter: “Her talent, her generosity have illuminated the French cinema. Danielle Darrieux knew how to play everything with a prodigious spontaneity.”

Ms. Darrieux was 18 when she married Henri Decoin, a screenwriter and film director who became her mentor. Their divorce in 1941 was so friendly that he directed her in another three films more than a decade later. Her second husband was Porforio Rubirosa, the Dominican-born playboy diplomat who later married the American heiresses Doris Duke and Barbara Hutton. Rubirosa and Ms. Darrieux married in 1942 and remained in France during the Occupation, working for Continental, a German-controlled film company, which led to accusations that she was a Nazi sympathizer. She later said that she had been forced to do the films because of death threats against Rubirosa.

Ms. Darrieux and Rubirosa divorced in 1947. The next year she married Georges Mitsinkides, a Greek-born writer and producer, and they were together until his death in 1991. Her only son, Mathieu Mitsinkides; her brother, Olivier Darrieux, a French comic actor; and her sister, Claude Hussenot-Desenonges, also died in the 1990s, within four years of one another. She is survived by Mr. Jenvrin.

Ms. Darrieux was known for keeping her private life private, and when she gave interviews she tended to be modest. Asked the secret of her successful life in an interview with Cinémotions in 2004, she offered: “I have always put more effort into my private life than my career. I have never let success go to my head, and I never thought it was forever, nor that I was amazing.”

She also exhibited a clear view of reality. “The world is truly bizarre,” she told the weekly magazine L’Express in 1997. “In that context, the role of artists is to bring a little release and pleasure.” She described herself as a woman subdued in her later years, but when asked if she was melancholy, she answered, “But don’t you think everybody is?”

On the other hand, she pointed out, “It is no crime to be happy.”

How do you sell a $7 million townhouse that’s still under construction? Find a sofa that complements concrete.

At least that was the solution adopted by the Fortis Property Group, the developer of six new townhouses in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn that were first listed in April. Fortis filled one of the unfinished concrete shells with luxury furniture a few weeks ago and threw a party.

The event halted construction in one of the townhouses to allow Interior Marketing Group, a luxury staging company, to furnish several floors and an outdoor space with cream-toned furniture and leather-and-steel coffee tables. The effect was eye-catching, if a bit jarring.

“Labour’s policies didn’t change in the leadership transfer from Andrew Little to Jacinda Ardern,” Mr. Nana said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
An unassuming figure, she is known for her past D.J. sets and installing her own toilet — to the chagrin of New Zealand’s plumbers — but is also a confessed policy “geek” who worked for years in the New Zealand and British Labour movements and headed a socialist organization before becoming a lawmaker in 2008.

During the campaign, Ms. Ardern became an unintentional feminist hero when she batted away an interviewer’s question about whether she would have babies if she became prime minister. This week, a talk radio host called her a “chicky-babe.”

In her trademark no-nonsense fashion, Ms. Clark — also the former head of the United Nations Development Program — said that Ms. Ardern had received “more than her fair share of very silly comments” during the campaign but voiced hope that New Zealanders would now “let her get on with the job” of governing.

In New Zealand, political parties must band together to form a coalition government if no party wins enough seats to govern outright. Labour did not win the most seats in the September election; that distinction went to the center-right National Party, led by the incumbent prime minister, Bill English.

But National did not win enough to govern alone, and the decision about who would become prime minister was left to the eccentric, populist leader of a minor party, Winston Peters of New Zealand First.

Weeks of negotiations followed before Mr. Peters threw his weight behind Ms. Ardern on Thursday night. Neither she nor her rival knew Mr. Peters’s decision before he announced it on live television.

Describing herself as “relentlessly optimistic,” Ms. Ardern will now face a National opposition of 56 members clamoring at the gates — smarting from losing an election they believed they had won — and must hold together a three-party governing deal, while also delivering on the change she promised.

The morning after her ascension, at a girls’ high school not far away from Parliament, final-year students were buzzing at the prospect.

Mia Faiumu, 18, and Narjis al-Zaidi, 17, two leaders of the feminist club at the school, Wellington East Girls’ College, hoped Ms. Ardern would improve the national curriculum for sex and consent education as well as decriminalize abortion, as she had promised (abortion is permissible in New Zealand with a doctor’s approval but remains illegal).

“She understands what it’s like to be a young woman today,” said Ms. Faiumu, who voted for Labour in this, her first, election. Before Ms. Ardern’s rise to leader, she said, her vote would have gone to the further-left Green Party, which will support Labour to pass its laws.

But she had been “hooked in by Jacindamania,” she said, using the term coined by the news media to describe the new leader’s ardent fans.

“Anyone who is marginalized would know that New Zealand isn’t the most progressive country if you’re not well-off or a man,” Ms. al-Zaidi said, adding that she thought Ms. Ardern would change that.

The young women enthused about Ms. Ardern’s “big vision,” saying they felt empowered by her win in spite of critics’ saying she could not deliver on such bold ideas.

The expectations for Ms. Ardern now are stacked high: from action on child poverty to solving a housing crisis and an increase in homelessness, she must also balance farming interests — the mainstay of New Zealand’s export market — with her party’s promise to clean up waterways and take action on climate change.

Ms. Clark, the former prime minister — whose office once employed a younger Ms. Ardern — said she believed it was “absolutely realistic” that the new prime minister could fill such a tall order, particularly in resolving the housing crisis, which she called a “disaster.”

In announcing his preference to have Ms. Ardern lead the country, the minor party leader, Mr. Peters, said that capitalism had failed the poorest New Zealanders.

A populist who has traditionally run on an anti-immigration platform, Mr. Peters said Ms. Ardern’s party was the one to steer New Zealand away from neoliberalism, favored by the National Party, which had governed New Zealand for the past nine years.

But some analysts questioned how radical Ms. Ardern’s economic agenda really was. The prominent economist Ganesh Nana said that far from a socialist figure in the mold of Bernie Sanders, Ms. Ardern was offering a fairly mainstream fiscal plan unlikely to be seen as upending capitalism in New Zealand.

“Labour’s policies didn’t change in the leadership transfer from Andrew Little to Jacinda Ardern,” Mr. Nana said. “They just found someone who could sell them.”

He predicted some elements of social and economic change would emerge under Ms. Ardern’s leadership.

“I think it will change the tenor of the discussion and debate about the balance between the haves and have-nots,” he said. “Will it be enough to satisfy progressives who voted for her? We’ll have to wait and see.”

Previous New Zealand coalition governments had proved fractious at times, and Ms. Clark, who has run three of them, said it was crucial to establish regular communication between party leaders so that no partner in the deal was left surprised. She said that aligned with Ms. Ardern’s strongest suit.

“She communicates a lot of empathy with people, and that makes her a very inclusive person,” Ms. Clark said. “She gives people the impression — and I think it’s a reality — that she’s interested in them.”

In Wellington on Friday, women’s advocates were waiting to hear how Ms. Ardern would use those skills to advance their agenda.

Citing New Zealand’s relatively high domestic violence rates and the fact that Parliament was still only 38 percent female, the president of the National Council of Women, Vanisa Dhiru, said Ms. Ardern’s appointment did not necessarily mean a victory for gender equality.

“In some ways, not enough has changed from 1893, when New Zealand first gave women the vote,” she said, mentioning sexual violence and the gender pay gap. “We need stronger initiatives and plans to move the dial for women.”

She looked down and smiled. She took her time, and then, with her chin still lowered, she raised her eyes to look kindly at the student.

“I’m going to answer your question,” she said, “but you have to promise me that the next time you meet a new father, you ask him how he’s balancing his work and the responsibilities of fatherhood.”

The young man shrugged. Adichie, who is 40, smiled warmly at him, but thereafter, the class, already intimidated and shy, grew only more so.

“Why don’t I read a bit?” she said finally, and she did.

AFTERWARD, ADICHIE and I sat at a restaurant in Columbia Heights. “He was quite sanguine, wasn’t he?” she said about the young man she’d carefully corrected. “Maybe he’s young enough that he hasn’t been indoctrinated into the cult of how and when to take offense. He can still look at the merits of an argument. Either that, or he was looking pleasantly at me and thinking, ‘Bitch, go away.’ ”

Adichie looks with a gimlet eye at American liberal doctrine, preferring open and frank debate to the narrow constraints of approved messaging. Though she is considered a global icon of feminism, she has, on occasion, displeased progressive sects when she’s expressed her beliefs about gender with candor and without using the latest terminology.

“It’s a cannibalistic ethos,” she says about the American left. “It swiftly, gleefully, brutally eats its own. There is such a quick assumption of ill will and an increasing sanctimony and humorlessness that can often seem inhumane. It’s almost as if the humanity of people gets lost and what matters is that you abide to every single rule in the handbook of American liberal orthodoxy.”

The day was not warm, but we ordered lemonade. Moments later, the waiter said they needed our table for a large party. We moved into a corner and the waiter forgot about us completely. Which seemed improbable, with Adichie’s glittering bag on the table serving as a kind of tabletop lighthouse.

“I’ll have you know,” she said, “that this bag was designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first woman creative director at Dior. A very interesting person. When she proposed the T-shirt, she sent me a handwritten note.”

I asked if Dior planned to make merchandise for every one of her books. Maybe a necklace that said “The Thing Around Your Neck”? A sconce that said “Half of a Yellow Sun”? Adichie laughed her distinctive laugh, which overtakes her whole torso but sounds like the giggle of a teenager. I should note here that I’ve known Adichie for about 10 years now, and she has always been startlingly easy to make laugh, and one of her very favorite subjects for ridicule is the exalted reputation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

She grew up in an upper-middle-class home, the fifth of six children. Her father was a professor at the University of Nigeria, her mother was the university’s registrar — the first woman to hold that post. Her parents expected Chimamanda to be a doctor, and for a year she studied medicine at university, but her heart wasn’t in it.

“When I said I wanted to write, they were very supportive, which was very unusual,” she said. “Nobody just leaves medical school, especially given it’s fiercely competitive to get in. But I had a sister who was a doctor, another who was a pharmacist, a brother who was an engineer. So my parents already had sensible children who would be able to make an actual living, and I think they felt comfortable sacrificing their one strange child.”

Adichie was just 26 when she published her first novel, “Purple Hibiscus,” in 2003. It won the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize for Best First Book. Her second, 2006’s “Half of a Yellow Sun,” was a shimmering work of historical fiction that reminded the world of the Biafran War and made it deeply personal; it won the Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (now called the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction) and garnered comparisons to one of her heroes, Chinua Achebe. The next year, she won a MacArthur grant and found time to finish a master’s degree in African studies at Yale. “The Thing Around Your Neck,” her first collection of stories, was published in 2009, followed by 2013’s “Americanah,” an intimate and accessible multigenerational story about family and immigration set in Nigeria and New Jersey. It won the National Book Critics Circle Award and has become an enduring best seller. While the majority of her previous work had been tightly controlled and gravely serious, “Americanah” was loose and irreverent.

“I decided with that book that I was going to have fun, and if nobody read it, that would be fine,” she said. “I was free of the burden of research necessary for the other books. I was no longer the dutiful daughter of literature.”

In “Americanah,” the protagonist, a Nigerian woman named Ifemelu, moves to New Jersey and is first confused and then amused by the cultural differences between African-Americans and Africans living in America. Ifemelu decides to explore the subject in a blog called Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black. Through the blog, Adichie was able to speak with disarming forthrightness about life as an African living in America: “I was tired of everyone saying that when you write about race in America, it has to be nuanced, it has to be subtle, it has to be this and that.”

The directness of the blog, I suggested, seemed to provide a bridge to her TEDx Talk, which became a book, which became a T-shirt and a bag.

“Yes and no,” she said. “But I’ll allow your thesis.” She laughed her laugh.

Now there is a follow-up called “Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions.” Asked by a friend, a new mother, for advice in making her daughter Chizalum a feminist, Adichie wrote another (very direct, lucid) work. Suggestion No. 1 reads, “Be a full person. Motherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.” No. 8: “Teach her to reject likability. Her job is not to make herself likable, her job is to be her full self, a self that is honest and aware of the equal humanity of other people.” And No. 15: “Teach her about difference. Make difference ordinary. Make difference normal. Teach her not to attach value to difference.”

The reaction to these manifestoes among a reading public longing for probity and directness has been profound. In a San Francisco auditorium last year, I witnessed Adichie step onto the stage in front of almost 3,000 people — the average age of the audience was about 20. She wore ankara-patterned pants and a white blouse and stood on four-inch heels, and the audience response was euphoric.

“It’s not that I told people something they don’t know, it’s just that I did it in language that was more accessible.” She looked around the restaurant. “But I don’t think we’re ever going to get our lemonade.”

ADICHIE AND HER HUSBAND, a physician, spend half of each year in Maryland, and the other half in Lagos, where they have a home and where her extended family lives.

In Nigeria, Adichie is considered a national icon, not only because her books have garnered such acclaim, but because quickly after her success she founded the Farafina Trust Creative Writing Workshop, a program where aspiring Nigerian writers spend a few weeks every year workshopping with Adichie and a coterie of international writers she brings to Lagos. She invited me to teach there in 2009, and I got the chance to meet her family and friends, all of whom were supportive, kind, funny, devoted — it was all sickeningly perfect.

One night, it became the obsession of one of the guest lecturers, the Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina, to bring Adichie to one of Lagos’s seamier nightspots. He asked her where that would be. She had no idea. “I’m a nice middle-class girl,” she said, laughing. “I don’t know about such places.” She was serious, though. She did not know.

So we called Adichie’s childhood friend Chuma. He suggested Obalende, a district of Lagos known for its nightclubs and strip clubs. Chuma picked us up and drove us to a neighborhood where fish and plantains were fried on the street, where the air was swampy with weed. He chose a club with a slanted roof of corrugated steel and Fela bursting from the sound system. We sat outside on a humid night, Adichie game but wide-eyed. We were visited by a street musician who would not leave. Adichie requested Fela’s “Unknown Soldier” and he played it, and we stayed late, and most of us got tipsy — even Adichie; she had one drink — and at the end of the night, I was the only one fit to drive, which I did, which everyone thought very funny, especially when we were pulled over by a traffic cop, who wanted a bribe. I did what I always do in that situation, which was to act like the world’s dumbest tourist, and it worked. He let us go, and Adichie, in the back seat, laughed all the way home.

A FEW MONTHS after her appearance at Cardozo high school, Adichie was on a rooftop in downtown D.C. It was breezy and the sky threatened rain. She had agreed to attend a book release party celebrating a collection of essays called “Having to Tell Your Mother Is the Hardest Part,” written by D.C. public school students, with guidance from tutors from 826DC, a nonprofit youth writing organization with which I’m affiliated.

A tent had been set up, and cocktails were served, and a young African-American man stepped to the podium. He was delicately built for 15, wearing a mustard-colored button-down, a tie and thick-framed glasses.

“When I was 2 years old, my mom and dad passed away,” the boy, whose name was Edwyn, read. “I was in and out of foster homes and was never in really good care. The way I used to grieve was by not eating or by fighting, and I always got in trouble. I would get angry whenever someone said, ‘Yo mama.’ I felt like I wanted to hurt someone. I have gotten past that, and now, I want to take my meds so I can grow emotionally and become a better me. I decided to try group vigils where I can talk about my loss, but it has never helped. I refused to share until, one time, I broke down and shared everything.”

The audience on the rooftop stood spellbound. I looked over to Adichie. Her eyes were wet. Edwyn continued. In a group home, he said, he almost stabbed another boy. He almost flunked out of school. Finally, he was adopted by a loving family who moved him to Washington. “I was starting to mature,” he read. “I started to change. Now I’m in the 10th grade, writing about how I used to grieve, but I am happy with the family I am with.”

His essay ended like that, and he sat down with the unaffected attitude of a student who had just read a paper about meiosis or the Louisiana Purchase. Afterward, we approached Edwyn, who was now surrounded by admirers. He shook Adichie’s hand like a cocktail party veteran, telling her he’d heard a lot about her and was happy she was there.

“I thought you were very brave,” Adichie said evenly.

Word of Adichie’s presence on the roof began making its way through the attendees. Another student, a gregarious young woman named Monae, approached. “I didn’t know you were here!” she said. “You were the one in Beyoncé’s song!” (A few years ago, Beyoncé sampled parts of Adichie’s “We Should All Be Feminists” talk in her 2013 song “Flawless.”)

“You have to read what I wrote!” Monae said, and gave Adichie a copy of “Having to Tell Your Mother Is the Hardest Part,” opened to a spread bearing her smiling face and her essay, titled “Queen.”

We made our way to a quiet part of the rooftop and watched the adults swarm the student-writers, getting their books signed.

“That is lovely,” Adichie said. “Just lovely.”

After the party, we said goodbye on the corner of Pennsylvania and 17th. Adichie’s parents were in town, visiting from Nigeria, and she had to get back to Maryland.

“That boy,” she said, and sighed. She was still thinking about Edwyn. “There was something so clean and pure and true about his writing, don’t you think? Increasingly I find that that’s the kind of thing I want to read.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

To continue this real estate metaphor, sometimes that porch light is not in a place one might expect, so it makes sense to search carefully for it, despite the penalties for trespassing. Some people — I count myself in this group — might know off the bat that the actor LEN Lesser played Uncle Leo on the television show “Seinfeld.” That’s one porch light. Another might be Castor OYL of comics, if that’s your thing. Or G.I. JANE, the Demi Moore film from 1997. Not a pop culture person? Try 50A’s “Six-Day War leader Dayan”: It’s not really a fill-in-the-blank, but you know that’s MOSHE. Maybe you’ve heard of CNN’s ANA Cabrera. Now you have five entries in this entertaining themeless crossword by Zhouqin Burnikel, and you are well on your way to branching out and making significant headway. Welcome home.

Of course, not all porch lights are that obvious, so sometimes you might need to heave a brick through the glass and climb in through a window, not that I would ever seriously suggest that anyone do such a thing, Officer. Maybe you knew that MARKET WATCH was the “Big news site for investors,” so you had the E in 22A, but you still thought the clue for 22A, “Evening result?” had something to do with nighttime. Not a direct way into the puzzle, but think about other meanings for the word “evening.” It could also mean to even things out, couldn’t it? So we’re looking for a three-letter word ending in E that means to even things out. The answer is TIE, as in a TIE score.

That’s been changing in the last five or so years, he added. A number of cities across California — from Davis to San Diego — have taken measures designed enhance the night sky.

By the end of this year, San Francisco is expected to finish converting roughly 18,500 of its sodium high-pressured streetlights to dark sky-compliant LED bulbs.

People can expect to see a noticeable difference, including more visible stars in the night sky, said Tyler Gamble, a spokesman with the city’s public utilities commission.

Los Angeles has also embraced LEDs in its streetlights, though the city chose a bulb with a bluish cast that critics say has only worsened the light pollution.

Dark sky groups recommend “warmer” LED bulbs with an amber glow. They also push the use of dimmers, motion sensors and timers wherever they make sense.

Softer lighting has been promoted in part on health grounds.

Research has shown that high-intensity lights at night actually do harm by suppressing hormones that help people fall asleep.

Mr. Murali, the photographer, said too many city dwellers seem to be unaware of what they miss in the absence of a truly starry sky. “We are always lost in our busy lives,” he said.

As a reminder, one might consider a trip to a place like Death Valley National Park.

The desert valley has some of the best stargazing in the United States, said Gavin Heffernan, a co-creator of Skyglow, a video series and book that spreads awareness about light pollution.

“It’s really incredible,” he said. “You really feel as if you’re just walking on Mars.”

And Finally ...

In the charred rubble of Santa Rosa it was the McDonald’s that drew Penny Wolin, a photographer who lives nearby.

Touring the destruction last week, she said she was stunned by the amount of destruction. “I had to really calm down,” she said.

She arrived at a shopping complex on the western edge of the 101 Freeway, which the Tubbs Fire had leapt in its sprint into the Coffey Park neighborhood.

A Kmart and an Americas Best Value Inn had been incinerated. So had the McDonald’s, yet some of the restaurant’s cheery exterior remained intact.

“It’s still looking sort of normal, like ‘Come on in,’” said Ms. Wolin, 64. “But in fact the plastic is melted on the post and the arches had fallen to the ground and the ‘McDonald’s’ is so burned it’s almost a black-and-white photograph.”

She continued, “I’ll tell you, that, for me, tells the whole thing and points the way to our larger American society for the moment.”

Ms. Wolin shared a collection of her images. It’s called “Good Morning McDonald’s.”

A 'Soulful Journey' in a Family Photo Album
-Keywords-
['started', 'family', 'cuba', 'album', 'sons', 'father', 'wife', 'bazan', 'teaching', 'mr', 'book', 'soulful', 'journey']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor.
When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Photo

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

Trump had that “kind of bluntness and occasionally even crass language which, if nothing else, at least meant authenticity,” said Jay Heiler, a lawyer considering a run against Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a rare Republican critic of Trump. “The president just hit a lot of nerves that a lot of conventional politicians didn’t even know were there.”

Those nerves still tingle. Nine months into the presidency, the support of Trump’s base remains fervid. I am often asked whether I believe Trump will be impeached. I’ve taken to responding that it’s more likely he’ll be a two-term president. I’d put the chances of impeachment at under 10 percent and of his re-election at about 25 percent.

That’s partly because the Democratic Party has not yet begun a serious reckoning with its defeat last year. It hasn’t grasped the degree to which it lives, still, in a coastal echo chamber of identity politics and Trump-bashing. Being anti-Trump won’t cut it. As Chuck Coughlin, a Republican political consultant who once worked for Senator John McCain, put it to me: “Somebody who speaks to common-sense American values — that is what the Democrats need.” I’m not sure who that person is but am pretty sure she or he does not reside in New York, Massachusetts or California.

Coughlin went on: “A Democratic party that can’t tell me how many genders there are, that ain’t flying in this country.”

American fracture is the nation’s overriding condition. It keeps widening. Jeff DeWit, the Republican state treasurer of Arizona, picked up Trump at the airport for that 2015 Phoenix rally; he remains an ardent fan of Trump’s “movement of people dying for something different.”

His deputy, Mark Swenson, told me: “America was formed by a bunch of people who just wanted to be left alone.” For that, guns help. “Bad guys have guns, so good guys should have guns, too,” Dewit said, rejecting my suggestion that the recent American carnage in Las Vegas showed the need for stricter gun laws.

Trump winks at white supremacists, thrives on confrontation and debases the Oval Office. But it would be a huge mistake to conclude from this that his defeat is inevitable; or that his supporters do not include millions of decent, smart Americans who just view the world differently. Americans who feel culturally alienated from the globalized metropolis (and sense their worldview elicits contempt in a Democratic Party that often seems to have lost touch with ordinary Americans).

Heiler, the pro-Trump lawyer considering a Senate run, turned to the president’s campaign against black footballers who refuse to stand for the national anthem. “Many African-Americans are focused on a particular set of facts and circumstances” that “drive that conduct, that protest,” Heiler said. “But when many other Americans see it, and Americans of all races,” they think “gosh, these guys all have it pretty good. You know they make a really good living, playing football. This country’s been really good to them. And so, even if they have an ax to grind, they shouldn’t grind it against the country or its symbol or its anthem.”

Heiler said he wouldn’t condemn the protesting players’ choice, even if he disagreed, but “there’s simply no getting around that when you make that choice you’re going to alienate a lot of Americans.”

Now the vague particular “circumstances” alluded to by Heiler includes gross police brutality against black kids and the history of oppression of African-Americans. Players who protest are exercising a fundamental American right. But yes, they are “going to alienate a lot of Americans.” Trump, at some level, is going to win this argument.

An overriding lesson of 2016 for liberals is that without hard-nosed realism about the state of the country and Trump’s talents, you lose. And that’s the truth.

A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Mr. Ranzetta learned all about the system as a teenager. The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”

The developers, Alchemy Properties and Carlyle Group, bought the site, which was home to a low-lying retail building, for $51 million last year. They are expecting a sellout value of about $226 million, according to documents filed with the office of the State Attorney General.

“Finding sites on the Upper West Side is nearly impossible,” said Kenneth Horn, the president and founder of Alchemy, adding that broad swaths of the area are under landmark protection.

But unlike new development downtown, where finding adequate sites is also rare, Mr. Horn said the Upper West Side is not accustomed to flashy glass towers, and buyers gravitate to what is familiar – and family-friendly.

“We wanted to blend into the fabric” of the neighborhood, he said, but with amenities that the grande dame, prewar co-ops often cannot provide. There will be 6,000 square feet of amenities, including a gym, golf simulator, basketball court and a professional music studio open to children and adults.

The interiors will feature oak flooring in a herringbone pattern, custom wood cabinetry by Smallbone of Devizes, and some units will have private outdoor spaces.

(Alchemy is making a similar, albeit pricier bet at the Gothic Revival-style Woolworth Tower in TriBeCa, where the penthouse is listed for $110 million.)

In total, there are just seven new residential projects on the Upper West Side that have filed offering plans recently, said Gabby Warshawer, director of research at CityRealty, a real estate data firm.

Among the new projects are a number of glassy, angular towers rising near the Hudson River, on the former Penn Central rail yard around West 60th Street. Now known as Waterline Square, the sprawling development is changing some buyers’ perception of the Upper West Side, and commanding high prices for the area.

At One Waterline Square, a 37-story condo and rental tower designed by Richard Meier and Partners Architects, the average price is $2,905 a square foot, Ms. Warshawer said, the highest among new projects in the area. Amenities at the tower will include a skate park, a rock-climbing wall and a bowling alley.

At 250 West 81st Street, Alchemy is seeking an average $2,817 per square foot, putting them in competition with buyers who might be tempted by the glassy, Far West Side developments.

“I think we have a different buyer,” said Alexa Lambert, an agent with Stribling Marketing Associates, which is handling sales with Alchemy. “Obviously we’re looking for families,” she said, because of the mix of larger units. But you can’t discount the appeal of a new masonry building, she said, especially one with Mr. Stern’s name attached.

Mr. Stern’s firm is not new to the Upper West Side. In 2007, they finished the Harrison, a 125-unit brick condo building with prewar flavor. Soon after, they finished 15 Central Park West, the limestone tower that many credit as the catalyst for the ultraluxury condo boom that followed.

In 2012, Sanford Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, sold his penthouse there for $88 million, a record at the time, to an entity controlled by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev.

Unlike 15 Central Park West, which attracted several high-profile international buyers, Mr. Stern said his new project will have a local vibe, on a more intimate scale.

“I don’t think this building is being designed for Russian oligarchs to come jazzing in for two nights and picking up a little smoked salmon,” said Mr. Stern, the former dean of the Yale School of Architecture, noting that this building will serve as a primary home for many buyers.

Still, the condo on 81st Street will have a common bond with the ultraluxury tower farther south – Mr. Stern’s appreciation for stone. The building will start at the base with Indiana limestone and transition to a buff colored brick, with limestone trim, he said.

“You can tell your readers and tell the developers,” he said. “No glass. They’re safe with me if they want a masonry building.”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — I’m always amazed by the variety of talents and professional skills that New York Times crossword constructors bring to the table. Some are musicians, some are scientists, all of them are very smart. They’re definitely an erudite bunch, and Mark MacLachlan is no exception: He’s a chemist who was last seen taking us on a cruciverbal roller coaster ride.

In comparison, I bang out words about solving crossword puzzles on a daily basis, and my greatest achievement this week is to try to win a bet with my editor that I can get through an entire column about noble gases without making a joke about breaking wind. Let’s see how long I last.

My point is, we should appreciate our constructors. These people take time out of their busy lives to make puzzles that challenge and entertain us, and they are much smarter than I am, except perhaps when it comes to gas puns.

Today’s Theme

Mr. MacLachlan connects five of the noble gases on the periodic table of chemical elements with their clue numbers: Helium, for example, which is number 2 on the periodic table, is in the grid at 2D. Neon, which is number 10, is at 10A. The other three are for you to expand upon. [I’ll let that one slide. — Ed.]

Toward the bottom [O.K., now you’re pushing it. — Ed.], Mr. MacLachlan offers us a two-part revealer at 38- and 43D (NOBLE GAS / ELEMENT) and at the last Across entry, he’s tucked in the abbreviation for atomic number, AT NO.

Yet his heir, Stalin, was evil incarnate, sending millions to the gulag or murdering them outright.
Then consider the most glaring truth: Whatever Stalin perfected was rooted in the Leninist system.
“From his first few hours as leader of Russia, he laid the ground for rule by terror,” Sebestyen writes.

All of Leninism may be reduced to two famous words uttered by the Founder in 1921 and repeated by Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin: “Kto kovo?” “Who, whom?” That is, who will do in whom? A comrade-turned-foe gave Lenin something of a pass by invoking tragedy. Lenin “desired the good … but created evil.” Sebestyen seems to agree: The “worst of his evils was to have left a man like Stalin in a position to lead Russia after him. That was a historic crime.”

This sounds a familiar note: Lenin was history’s agent of necessity and justice, bringing down a decrepit czarist regime that had enslaved an entire nation. Yet his heir, Stalin, was evil incarnate, sending millions to the gulag or murdering them outright. Robert Conquest, the cleareyed historian of the Soviet Union who wrote “The Great Terror,” the definitive work on Stalin’s purges, quipped in a limerick: “There was a great Marxist named Lenin / Who did two or three million men in. / That’s a lot to have done in / But where he did one in / That grand Marxist Stalin did 10 in.”

To be fair, Sebestyen doesn’t fall for those exculpatory tales spun by so many Westerners to wrest “good” Marxism from Stalin’s butchering hands. And neither did Conquest. Yes, Stalin “did in” 10 times more than the First Bolshevik. But factor in time. Lenin had only seven years in power while Stalin had 30. Then consider the most glaring truth: Whatever Stalin perfected was rooted in the Leninist system.

It was Lenin who created the “basis for a one-man tyranny,” the Polish scholar Leszek Kolakowski notes in his magisterial “Main Currents of Marxism.” “We do not promise any freedom, or any democracy,” Lenin exclaimed at the Third Congress of the Comintern in 1921. “We were never concerned with the Kantian-priestly and vegetarian-Quaker prattle about the sacredness of human life,” his comrade Trotsky declared in “The Defense of Terrorism.” As Kolakowski put it tout court: Like Lenin, Stalin “was the personification of a system which irresistibly sought to be personified.”

Where the system was heading, shattering all “hopes and dreams for freedom under the revolution,” became cruelly obvious as early as 1921, when sailors revolted at the Kronstadt naval base. At first, they clamored for larger rations, echoing the mutiny of 1905 — the original Russian revolution — immortalized in Eisenstein’s “Battleship Potemkin.” Then it escalated, though peacefully. A mass meeting drew up a list of political demands: free elections, free trade unions, a free press and the abolition of the Cheka, the secret police that had taken over from the czar’s Okhrana.

“They must be shown no mercy,” Lenin thundered. He dispatched 20,000 troops under the command of Trotsky, who unleashed an “inferno,” according to Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who would rise to Marshall of the Soviet Union. Sebestyen rightly depicts the massacre as a turning point. “After the savagery … few people would be under any illusions that Lenin would brook serious opposition.”

The terror was systemic, not Stalin’s creation. As Dostoyevsky observed in “The House of the Dead,” “Tyranny is a habit. It has its own organic life; it develops finally into a disease. … Blood and power intoxicate.” Maxim Gorky, an early supporter who would soon call Lenin a “coldblooded trickster,” concurred: Former slaves “will become unbridled despots as soon as they have the chance.” So radicalization was not a matter of personality, but destiny.

Lenin used his chance well. “From his first few hours as leader of Russia, he laid the ground for rule by terror,” Sebestyen writes. On the second day, he began to censor the press. On Dec. 7, 1917, he set up the Cheka to combat “counterrevolution, speculation and sabotage.” He abolished the legal system in favor of “revolutionary justice,” which legitimized every perversion of the law. “To us,” Lenin pontificated, “all is permitted. … Blood? Let there be blood.” For victory was not possible “without the very cruelest revolutionary terror.”

The scholar Robert Service puts it all in a nutshell in his acclaimed book “A History of Modern Russia”: “The forced-labor camps, the one-party state … the prohibition of free and popular elections, the ban on internal party dissent: not one of them had to be invented by Stalin. … Not for nothing did Stalin call himself Lenin’s disciple.” But why blame only Lenin and Stalin? As Sebestyen emphasizes: “The structure of the police state had been established under Nicholas I in the 1820s.”

The difference between czarism and Leninism is the one between absolutism and totalitarianism. It is one-man rule in both systems, but the critical ingredient is the total state — what the Nazis imposed as Gleichschaltung — the liquidation of civil society top to bottom: parties, unions, media, churches, guilds and associations.

Lenin’s most brilliant invention was a secular religion: Communism. If you believe in me, you will gain salvation — not in the Great Beyond, but in the Here and Now. And if you don’t believe, the revolutionary faith pronounced, we will kill you. With this brand-new choice — paradise on earth or speedy demise — the “obstinate little man” made a revolution that shook the world and inspired tyrants round the globe.

Though dead for more than 90 years, Lenin lives on in his mausoleum and in the minds of millions of Russians who have stood in line to commune with a corpse. Today, as Sebestyen writes in his concluding words, Lenin is being “used by a new breed of autocrats, extreme nationalists who may have dispensed with Communism but nevertheless respect Lenin as a strongman in the Russian tradition.” Lenin is dead; Leninism lives.

The incidence of mouth and throat cancers caused by the human papillomavirus in men has now surpassed the incidence of HPV-related cervical cancers in women, researchers report.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that 11 million men and 3.2 million women in the United States had oral HPV infections. Among them, 7 million men and 1.4 million women had strains that can cause cancers of the throat, tongue and other areas of the head and neck.

The risk of infection was higher for smokers, for people who have had multiple sex partners, and for men who have sex with men. Frequent oral sex also increased the risk. The rate was higher among men who also had genital HPV. (Almost half of men aged 18 to 60 have a genital HPV infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

Neither age nor income made a difference in high-risk oral infection rates, but rates among non-Hispanic blacks were higher than other races and ethnicities.

HPV vaccination is recommended starting at age 11 or 12 and is effective, said the senior author, Ashish A. Deshmukh, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, and “it’s crucial that parents vaccinate boys as well as girls.”

The lead author, Kalyani Sonawane, also at the University of Florida, said that behavioral change is important, too, particularly smoking cessation. “The difference in oral HPV infection between smokers and nonsmokers is staggering,” she said.

BARCELONA, Spain — These days, the city of Barcelona wears two hats. And not too comfortably.

On the one hand, Barcelona is a global city, a former host of the Olympics, and the home of one of the world’s most famous soccer clubs, F.C. Barcelona. It is a magnet for more than 10 million visitors a year, an example of the ways large cities increasingly influence global politics, economics and culture.

On the other hand, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, Spain’s restive northeastern region, and the nerve center of a drive for Catalan independence that is described by its opponents as parochial, exclusive and nationalist.

In that campaign — which the Spanish government now says it will take emergency measures to halt — there is no place in Catalonia with more at stake. In Barcelona, the issue of independence has provoked exceptionally sharp soul-searching and debate over allegiances and identity, with an intensity not seen since Britain voted to leave the European Union.

In short, people are worried. First among them is the city’s leftist mayor, Ada Colau, who is not in favor of leaving. “It’s a very pluralistic city and there is a lot of diversity of opinions in Barcelona,” she said in an interview this week.

To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
But if the gardens are, at least to some extent, the source of some of Van Noten’s inspiration, they are also a metaphor for the daily difficulties of running an independent fashion label with the degree of autonomy and oversight that Van Noten has. As we walk through an allée of topiaried cypress, Van Noten says that he and his longtime partner in both business and life, Patrick Vangheluwe, often joke that they’ll someday write a book titled “The Depressed Gardener,” about all the things that can go wrong in a garden, no matter the allowances made for changing climates, unpredictable weather, rapacious insects and on and on. You plan and plan, he says, and something always goes awry anyway. The depressed gardener knows that. He also knows, however, that it is simply what happens when you try to control what cannot be controlled — to be a depressed gardener is to live in a state of constant humility. But it also means a heightened ability to appreciate the strange gifts that circumstance sometimes affords. It means living a life of unknowns, large and small, and yet never ceasing in one’s attempts to coax beauty from even the most forbidding, the meanest of places: the spots of earth that everyone else has overlooked.

TRYING TO EXPLAIN the fever that Van Noten’s clothes induce to someone who’s never seen them is an unsatisfying task, because they in many ways defy what we’ve been taught to admire in contemporary fashion. You don’t, for example, buy a Dries Van Noten dress or shirt or skirt simply for its cut: The shapes, some of which appear season after season, are conventionally feminine and invariably flattering, smartly crafted and architecturally sound. A Dries Van Noten midi-length dress will always be draped in just the right way, so that it allows the illusion of a waist without actually defining it; a Dries Van Noten skirt, a straight sheath of lightweight silk, will always be slim enough to just skim over the hips, but not so slim that it impedes movement. But they are never transgressive, and they are not invitations to reconsider the female form. Cutouts, extreme dimensions, shoulder pads, extravagant volume — you will rarely find these in a Van Noten garment.

And yet in a strange way, Van Noten’s closest peer might be his apparent opposite, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, whom the designer admires and who is, like Van Noten, a member of the very tiny 100-percenter club, internationally recognized fashion designers who own and oversee virtually every aspect of their businesses. (Other members include Giorgio Armani and Raf Simons.) Not aesthetically, of course — Kawakubo’s work is consistently, defiantly avant-garde — but what defines both of their work is an inimitable perspective, a refusal to concede to trends or whims. Their work is instantly recognizable as their own, and because the pieces they produce originate from a single mind, a single vision, they are almost impossible to copy or duplicate (not well, anyway) — a Dries Van Noten piece will never be mistaken for anyone else’s. Fashion, these days, is often meant to stand for something — it is meant to disrupt, to challenge (sometimes literally), it is increasingly expected to have a political statement to share; Van Noten’s fashion, however, stands for nothing but itself, and for the obsessions of the man who created it. It is cool instead of hot; it encourages interiority instead of provocation. In an age that rewards the person who can shout the loudest, the truly radical act is the embrace of the subtle.

Van Noten’s great gift is color. No living designer understands it as well as he does; no other designer has such a rich vocabulary of tone and hue that certain shades, once seen, are impossible to associate with anything other than his clothes. Dior may have had his New Look; Van Noten has a particular blue: brighter than indigo, blacker than a cornflower, deeper than the Pacific. There is also a Dries Van Noten yellow (a rich, yolky marigold); a Dries Van Noten green (the gleaming, dense color of an emerald placed on a square of dark velvet); a Dries Van Noten red (cinnabar-ish and slightly chalky) and a Dries Van Noten purple (a dusty eggplant). But it’s not just the colors themselves that make Van Noten’s clothes so memorable, so resonant; it’s what he does with them, forcing them into strange relationships and juxtapositions that, if you encountered them only as words — persimmon and seashell; compost and moss — might sound unlikely, even occasionally unpleasant. In reality, though, the couplings are revelatory, so effortless that they ask you to reassess the limited way we’ve been encouraged to see color in the first place — why, after all, can’t iris purple pair with camel? Why can’t dulce de leche brown coexist with kelp blue?

Every one of Van Noten’s shows force these reconsiderations, but my favorite is probably his fall 2009 ready-to-wear women’s collection, which appeared, if you blurred your vision a bit, as a series of tonal, Rothkoesque blocks, each hue dyed to just the point where it almost became some other color altogether: a claret-y red-purple sweater above a lichen-y blue-green skirt; a peachy pink-orange skirt worn beneath a grassy gold-green shirt. The clothes in that collection were lovely for other reasons, too — there were sharp, cinch-waisted coats and slouchy, insouciant sweaters (a Van Noten specialty) and a skirt made of soft tiers of shirred and frayed silk that seemed to float in the air like milkweed fluff — but it was dominated by an abstraction, the suggestion that fashion might be not just about how a garment feels on the skin or how it intimates the figure beneath, but about how it tries to express and make sense of color: the natural world’s most enduring, bewitching and elusive bestowment.

We have grown used to speaking of designers as loving a woman’s body — this usually means that they either make clothes that are very sculpting, or clothes that are deliberately unsculpting — but Van Noten’s clothes seem made not so much for a woman’s body as for a woman’s mind: You are drawn to his work because you want to find yourself closer to the person who, you imagine, shuts his eyes and sees such a glorious jumble of color.

Amy Adams Greats Cover Dries van Noten is featured on one of the covers of T's Oct. 22 Greats issue. See the other six covers

ALONG WITH COLOR, Van Noten also has an unrivaled sense of pattern. The designs that ornament his clothes allude to everything from Qing Dynasty decorations and the paintings of Francis Bacon to Ottoman-era iconography and the artist James Reeve’s photographs of cities at night. All designers take from cultures and periods and artists foreign to their own experience, of course, but too often, their tributes feel costume-y, suggesting an invented passion rather than a real one. Van Noten’s borrowings are less literal than they are gestural — yes, the pieces in his fall 2012 collection were covered with stylized Chinese dragons and phoenixes (rendered in a vivid, imperial saffron), but they were pieced alongside shimmering stripes of vermilion and jade of the sort that adorn the canopies of tantric Buddhist temples in Nepal, and Japanese cranes stitched in gold and frozen in midflight. The difference between a designer and a copyist is that a designer makes his source material into something else, something his own; he doesn’t just present it, unchanged and unsynthesized, as work he’s created himself.

Curiously, it is in his wide-ranging eye, in his knowledge of textile and artistic traditions from the world’s great civilizations, that Van Noten announces himself as Flemish. Designers these days rarely work where they were born or became adults — to be in fashion now is to exchange actual citizenship for the parallel universe in which the industry operates, a universe consisting of Milan, Paris, London, New York and maybe Tokyo — and yet Van Noten, who is as well-traveled as any of his peers, continues to reside and work in Antwerp, where he was born, raised and educated. (His current estate, Ringenhof, an 1840s neo-Classical stone house built for a local beer brewer, is a peaceful 30-minute drive from the city center.) When Van Noten was a child, Antwerp was mostly a quiet, bourgeois town, and yet fashion, the idea of it, wasn’t an impossible concept for him. His father, himself descended from a family of tailors, owned several boutiques and made regular trips to Milan and Paris to buy polite, well-constructed Italian and French wares: shoes from Ferragamo, shirts from Charvet. As a teenager, Van Noten acted as the buyer for the children’s department. The stores would occasionally host Saturday-afternoon shows, local models spinning through the space while wearing the season’s new offerings. In making their lives in textiles, in fabrics, in goods from all the countries and cultures surrounding tiny Belgium, the family was following in the Lowlands’ centuries-long legacy of trade, joining the generations of burghers who let their fingertips trace over foreign silks and foreign wools, who measured foreign dyes and foreign powders. If you were a wealthy 13th-century merchant in Bruges, 60 miles west of Antwerp, you would, in a real way, spend your lifetime encountering patterns and colors from lands you could only imagine through their material goods; wonderment would be in your blood. To be Flemish — as Van Noten adamantly is — was to spend your life looking outward and beyond.

This perspective may explain in part why the arrival of the so-called Antwerp Six — a group of early ’80s graduates of the fashion school at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts that included Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester and Walter Van Beirendonck, who together mounted a now-legendary, semi-guerrilla-style show in London in 1986 — was more a surprise to the rest of the world than to the participants themselves. (Martin Margiela is a contemporary of the Antwerp Six, though he wasn’t part of that initial presentation.) Van Noten crossed into adulthood in the 1970s, in the early years of modern cultural globalization, when ideas and aesthetics and music and art traveled faster and farther than ever before in human history. You could be an adolescent in Antwerp and hear punk music from London or West Berlin, and suddenly you would understand that someone out there was creating something that you could be a part of, that you could participate in, that seemed to communicate directly to you. You were seeing images in magazines and on television of people your age or a little older or a little younger doing things that you too might be able to do, and it was transfixing, transformative. For Van Noten, that person was David Bowie, and years later, he paid homage to him — his narrow, bladelike suits, his languor and loucheness — again and again. And it wasn’t just in fashion: All over, in countries both free and not, young people were realizing that what might unite them wasn’t family or heritage or nation, it was music or art or theater or film. They were creating the new wave, the avant-garde, but they had begun doing so as a way of seeking some sort of greater connection — as a way to reach somebody else.

AFTER THE LONDON SHOW, Van Noten returned home and started selling. He had begun his business in men’s wear, and one of his first (and most enduring) clients, Barneys New York, had simply bought the smallest sizes from his collection and sold them as women’s wear. Three years later, in 1989, he moved his small boutique into a five-floor former department store in a run-down section of town and began in earnest the business of being a fashion designer.

He never stopped. Absent from Van Noten’s three-decade career are stories of bankruptcy, strife, irresponsibility, overleverage, overexpansion, overspending or unhinged, dangerous effulgence. He worked slowly and carefully; he did only what he wanted to, when he wanted to. Along the way, there were challenges (global recessions, a luxury market that grew ever more fickle, trends and fads and gimmicks to withstand) and triumphs: a women’s boutique in Paris in 2007; a second in Tokyo and a men’s wear boutique in Paris in 2009; a sumptuous exhibition, “Inspirations,” one of the few granted to a living designer, at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs in 2014. But what remained constant was Van Noten’s discipline, his aversion to self-indulgence, to folly, his adherence to a rigor that announces itself in his designs and in his conduct: a sense of discipline that, paradoxically, has earned him extraordinary artistic freedom. He has to make compromises — every creative person does, in one way or another — but he rarely has to make concessions. Today, he controls every element of his business. (He collaborates on the line’s shoes with a manufacturer.) He will tell you, without apology, that he wants his clothes to sell; that he makes his clothes to sell. His business, its longevity and health, is a reminder that one of the most seductive fictions of fashion is that it exists as a pure aesthetic expression — and yet those who believe this are those who disappear after a year or five, comets whose tails fade quickly into the glittering black.

A visit to Van Noten’s offices, now headquartered in a 60,000-square-foot, six-floor waterfront warehouse, recalls in many ways a visit to his gardens: Here is Van Noten’s other world, or a continuation of it, the place where he executes those ideas, those images, those strange colors he imagines while strolling among Ringenhof’s hollyhocks and smoke trees. If you begin at the top floor showroom and work downward, you can see the entire operation unfold before you, from the design team’s desks, some fitted with a little cabinet stuffed with scraps of deliciously colored swatches of silks, jacquards, wools, jerseys and cottons, and continuing down through the financial department, the sales department, the production and distribution departments and the archives. But it is the ground floor — the shipping department — that is somehow both the most moving and most impressive. When I visited, the first deliveries of the fall collection were arriving. Each garment is sorted, inspected and then boxed. Van Noten wandered through the maze of boxes — stacked several high, almost scraping the ceilings — pointing out which was going to Moscow, which to Hong Kong, which to Singapore, which to New York; along with eight boutiques, the collection is sold in more than 400 stores worldwide. He appeared, in those moments, a touch bewildered — or maybe simply awe-struck. It was a Willy Wonka kind of fantasy, to stand in a building in your hometown among hundreds of cartons packed with things you had dreamed up, all of them destined for places that you might never have imagined visiting as a child growing up not far from here, but now would be worn by people you would never meet in lands your ancestors would never have been able to see for themselves.

By now it was time for lunch, which would be served in the studio. Back upstairs we entered a high-ceilinged, near-empty room, where the page proofs of one of the designer’s upcoming books, a career survey, were laid on the ground. Last March, in Paris, Van Noten mounted his hundredth show, a joyous anthology of his signature, most Dries-like patterns and textures from across the years, many worn by some of his earliest models, now mostly in their late 40s. It was a reminder of the totality, the singularity of his vision, of how each season is in conversation with the last, of how, when you see a Dries Van Noten collection, you are seeing the latest installment in the sartorial equivalent of what the novelist David Mitchell calls an “über-book”: All of his works (in Mitchell’s case, fiction; in Van Noten’s case, fashion) are part of some grander mosaic that is visible only to its creator, and yet, equally, are revealing of some invisible part of its creator’s mind. This is why you can wear a Dries Van Noten dress or shift or skirt from any season at anytime, and although fellow members of the Van Noten tribe will recognize it as his, it will always look relevant, and surprising — a chapter in a book you love, but not one that is immediately nameable.

Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows. Here was the Turkish-inflected fall 2006 collection, with its patterns of Mughal-esque tulips, blown up exaggeratedly large, and the India-inspired fall 1996 show with its translucent, shocking chartreuse blouses and fragile, sparkling, sari-like column skirts. Together, we ambled up one row and then down another, looking at the photos at our feet, bursts of color against the cool cement. I asked him the lazy question you should never ask any artist — did he have a favorite look, a favorite show? — and he, like most artists, demurred. But then he corrected himself: Most of the collections were represented by only six pages, he said; if he really liked them, he might have devoted eight to them, or 10, or even 14. Once again, we began to move, counting the pages, calling out to each other — 10! 12! — and pausing at particularly striking works: a chiffon and burnt velvet caftan, a men’s coat so heavy with embroidery it resembled armor. If every life is a collection of images, too many to process and too many to remember, then this book was, in a real way, his life, or part of it, anyway: a beautiful life, one perfect in its wholeness and conception. To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?

We stopped before a picture of one of my favorite dresses, a gently draped silk sheath, its top a pattern of slashy lilac dashes against a bark-colored background; its bottom an almost Impressionistic blur of blue irises. I remembered this collection, this piece: It was from spring 2008, and I didn’t have the money to buy it. I would go to the store and try it on, and then I would have to leave it behind.

“This is one of the most gorgeous things I’ve seen,” I said.

Artists, no matter how well they might learn to project otherwise, are rarely humble people. Or rather, they are and they aren’t — to be an artist is, often, to live in the thin, unhappy space between arrogance and self-hatred, with one word tipping you over the line in one direction or another. Maybe that’s not the case for Van Noten, who doesn’t brag, doesn’t boast. But for a few seconds, he didn’t speak. His handsome face twitched into a suggestion of a frown. He stared at the dress as he’d stared at that rose, that rose that had so surprised him.

“A beautiful dress,” I repeated. He continued looking at the picture of that dress on the ground before us, something so lovely — the dull shimmer of the silk, the Dries Van Noten blue of the flowers — that not even he could claim otherwise. Sometimes, even the Depressed Gardener’s only move is to surrender to the enchantment of the thing before him.

“It is,” he said.

F.D.A. Approves Second Gene-Altering Treatment for Cancer

“Today marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” the F.D.A.
The first cell-based cancer treatment — Kymriah, made by Novartis — was approved in August for children and young adults with an aggressive type of acute leukemia.

The treatment was originally developed at the National Cancer Institute, by a team Dr. Steven Rosenberg led. The institute entered an agreement with Kite in 2012, in which the company helped pay for research and received rights to commercialize the results.

Largely on the strength of the new treatment and related research, the drug giant Gilead purchased Kite in August, for $11.9 billion.

“Today marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said in a statement. “In just several decades, gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer.”

Side effects can be life-threatening, however. They include high fevers, crashing blood pressure, lung congestion and neurological problems. In some cases, patients have required treatment in an intensive care unit. In the study that led to the approval, two patients died from side effects. Doctors have learned to manage them better, but it takes training and experience.

Partly for that reason, Yescarta, like Kymriah, will be introduced gradually, and will be available only at centers where doctors and nurses have been trained in using it.

“Ten to 15 authorized institutions will be ready to go at the time of the launch,” a spokeswoman for Kite, Christine Cassiano, said. “In 12 months, we expect to have 70 to 90. There’s a lot that goes into it, making sure each institution is ready to go.”

Companies have been racing to develop new forms of immunotherapy. The first cell-based cancer treatment — Kymriah, made by Novartis — was approved in August for children and young adults with an aggressive type of acute leukemia. It will cost $475,000, but the company has said it will not charge patients who do not respond within the first month after treatment. Novartis is expected to ask the F.D.A. to approve Kymriah for lymphoma and other blood cancers as well, and may vary its price depending on how well it works for those diseases.

Kite also plans to seek approval for other blood cancers, but does not plan to vary Yescarta’s price, said Ms. Cassiano.

The company also hopes that Yescarta will eventually be approved for earlier stages of lymphoma, rather than being limited to patients with advanced disease who have been debilitated by multiple types of chemotherapy that did not work, said Dr. David D. Chang, Kite’s chief medical officer and executive vice president for research and development.

“This is the beginning of many developments in cell therapy in the next few years,” Dr. Chang said in an interview.

He said the F.D.A. had “embraced” the concept of cell therapy, designating it a breakthrough and accelerating the approval process to speed its availability to cancer patients, many of whom do not have time to wait.

Kite and Novartis also hope to produce cell therapies for so-called solid tumors — like those of the lung, prostate, breast and colon — which account for about 90 percent of all deaths from cancer.

Before it was approved and named Yescarta, Kite’s treatment was known by other names: axi-cel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or KTE-C19.

The study that led to approval enrolled 111 patients at 22 hospitals; 101 of them received Yescarta. They had one of three diseases: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma or transformed follicular lymphoma.

Initially, 54 percent had complete remissions, meaning that their tumors disappeared. Another 28 percent had partial remissions, in which tumors shrank or appeared less active on scans. After six months, 80 percent of the 101 were still alive.

With a median follow-up of 8.7 months, 39 percent of the 101 were still in complete remission — a much higher rate than achieved with earlier treatments — and 5 percent still had partial remissions.

“Many patients were seriously contemplating their own mortality,” said Dr. Caron A. Jacobson, who helped conduct the study at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center in Boston. “We would be talking to them about other clinical trials, but also about hospice care and quality of life and comfort. You’re really seeing people get their life back. After a couple weeks in the hospital and a couple weeks at home, they go back to work. On its face, it’s quite remarkable and revolutionary.”

The treatment requires removing millions of a patient’s T-cells — a type of white blood cell that is critical to the immune system — freezing them and shipping them to Kite to be genetically engineered to kill cancer cells. The process reprograms the T-cells to attack B-cells, normal parts of the immune system that turn malignant in certain blood cancers. The revved-up T-cells — now known as “CAR-T cells” — are then frozen again and shipped back to the hospital to be dripped into the patient. The turnaround time is about 17 days.

Kite’s cell-processing facility, in El Segundo, Calif., can provide the treatment for 4,000 to 5,000 patients a year, Ms. Cassiano said, adding that the company has applied for approval in Europe, and if it is granted, will probably build a plant there.

Tina Bureau, a fifth-grade teacher from Queensbury, N.Y., was one of the lymphoma patients in the study. Previously, she’d had several types of chemotherapy.

“The cancer would shrink but then it would come right back,” she said.

Last spring, she had the T-cell treatment at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The side effects were ferocious.

“You don’t even recognize your family members,” Ms. Bureau said. “I had some bleeding on my brain, and had to be put in intensive care. The week it was happening, I don’t remember a lot. It was much more difficult for my family than me.”

Within a month, she had a complete remission, which has continued. She is back at work, full time.

“Yes, it can pose life-threatening problems,” Ms. Bureau said. “But when you’re in a situation where your life’s threatened anyway, I don’t feel you have anything to lose.”

Crossword-Solving: A Search for Connections and Answers

“Human brains are hard-wired to fill in blanks when they see them,” said Helen R. Friedman, a clinical psychologist in St. Louis. “In difficult times, when life begins to feel out of control or when faced with an emotional dilemma, working on something that has finite answers can provide a sense of security.”

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

“I feel klutzy while I’m doing it,” said Sharon Weinstein, a Times puzzle solver from North Potomac, Md. “But afterward there’s a great sensation of satisfaction.”

Lately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy, carrying fake news, spreading hate messages (and selling ads against them) and undermining American democracy. What I learned is that, for better or worse, they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monastery.

Road maps, a mainstay of my pre-cellphone trips to Europe, were nowhere to be found, nor were the bookstores that used to sell them. The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport, but that was about it. Everyone assumes you have access to Google Maps.

Once you’re off the major highways, Italian roads are a spider web connected by roundabouts, bristling with signs pointing to the nearest tiny villages but lacking any route numbers.

The tried-and-true method of asking for directions prompted some human interaction and gave my traveling companion the opportunity to practice his Italian. But it was a reminder that human beings are often unreliable. The rental car agent in Milan gave us directions to Siena via Genoa, a route, we later learned, that added about two hours to the trip.

Trying to find a house in the Tuscan countryside by asking passers-by was futile. No one in rural Italy seems to use street addresses, which, in any event, don’t correspond in any rational way to actual streets.

Living in the moment isn’t so great when you’re lost.

While I had no phone of my own, others with me had theirs, and I had to rely on them on several occasions, starting with simply finding our house. We had to call the housekeeper for directions (three times).

After that, I relied on borrowed phones, and we used Google Maps for navigation.

I shared my experience this week with Adam Alter, an associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of “Irresistible: the Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.”

“One problem for people who choose to be without phones is, as you found, that people expect you to have one, and infrastructure is designed with the knowledge that almost everyone does,” Mr. Alter said. “You’re borderline forced to carry one for basic utility even if you’d prefer not to.”

Without access to texts or email, I couldn’t see or respond to any messages, no matter how important. I waited three days before breaking down and (again) borrowing a cellphone to check email. But to gain access to my email from an unfamiliar device required a code sent via text to — where else? — my dead cellphone.

Once I gave that up, I was fine, perhaps because I didn’t feel any guilt — it wasn’t my fault the phone failed and I couldn’t check messages. For others, this may be difficult: Mr. Alter’s book reports that checking emails has become a widespread addiction.

At first I missed my phone’s camera feature. I was on holiday in a beautiful country, after all. But after a few days I stopped thinking about documenting the trip and simply enjoyed it.

Without internet access, I had no access to travel mainstays like TripAdvisor or OpenTable. But there were some old guidebooks at the house where we stayed, and major historic sites, tourist attractions and even restaurants don’t change much in a place like Italy.

I found it’s not hard to sniff out a promising restaurant that appeals to your personal taste, as opposed to crowdsourced recommendations. We made some wonderful discoveries. And afterward there were no emails asking me to review the experience (and provide sites like TripAdvisor with free editorial copy).

Mr. Alter pointed out that “this sort of serendipity is often the route to novel, exciting, trip-making experiences.”

He added, “Phones overschedule and over regiment our lives, which robs us of these opportunities.”

I quickly grew accustomed to having no news, stock market quotes or weather forecasts. I’d never want to live permanently without them, but checking out for 10 days was therapeutic.

I read nothing about Donald Trump.

Still, I broke down midweek when the housekeeper asked me what I knew about Harvey Weinstein. The accusations of the movie producer’s serial sexual misconduct had broken the day after I left, and were now blanketing Italian media. I knew nothing. So I borrowed a phone and read The New York Times account and then The New Yorker piece that followed. Both were riveting but interfered with what had, until then, been blissfully untroubled sleep.

After returning the rental car in Milan, I realized that no phone meant no Uber app. That meant we did a lot of walking in what turns out to be a fascinating city. And my anxieties about my return trip proved unfounded. I skipped the check-in kiosks at the airport, went to the check-in counter and got an old-fashioned paper boarding pass with minimum fuss.

I’d never leave home without a working smartphone again. But denied access to the internet, I had time to read several books. I focused more on the people with me and the beauty of my surroundings. I was more open to unplanned experiences. I had time for self-reflection. I’d like to think that, on future trips, I’d use the phone only when essential.

It turns out there’s an app to help people do that.

Called “Moment,” from the software developer Kevin Holesh, it is designed to curb cellphone dependence and promote “a sustainable work life balance,” as he puts it, by letting users set limits on their phone and internet use. (Put aside, for the moment, the paradox of needing a phone app to break you of your phone addiction.)

“Recently, I spent two weeks in a place without cellphone coverage and had a similar experience to you,” Mr. Holesh told me. “It was really inconvenient not to have Maps, but refreshing to not constantly be worrying about what’s going on.

“It was literally the longest stretch of time I’ve not accessed the internet in 15 years,” he continued. “The first few days were tough, but after that, I got used to the lack of connectivity and loved it.”

He suspects it was the sight of a young boy hauling plastic bags with a week’s worth of groceries that caught the attention of nosy neighbors and led to a visit from the city’s Administration for Children’s Services. He entered the foster system in April 2006.

For the next decade, Mr. Samuel grew inured to upheaval. Compliance with foster families felt pointless, he said, and putting in effort at school seemed futile.

“It was a lot of pressure for me, not seeing my parents, going to school at the same time,” Mr. Samuel said. “It was too much to balance.”

It was not until his late teenage years that he began to rein himself in, grasping the necessity of better positioning himself for a successful future. That revelation was born of discipline hammered into him from part-time jobs in the retail and service industries.

“Instead of me hanging outside at 2, 3 in the morning, I got a job and I’m coming home at 2, 3 in the morning,” Mr. Samuel said. “I love to work.”

Since aging out of foster care more than two years ago, he has lived in supportive housing in the Bronx. Mr. Samuel became interested in earning a high school diploma, but he admitted that procrastination had hampered his studies.

“I wish I could have done it at a younger age,” Mr. Samuel said. “I’d have been so good.”

Mr. Samuel also began taking advantage of the services offered at the Next Generation Center, a Children’s Aid program in the Bronx that helps young people transition to adulthood and independence. There, he connected with a life coach and enrolled in its culinary arts program.

In 2016, just shy of his 22nd birthday, Mr. Samuel received his Regents diploma from the High School for Service and Learning at Erasmus, an alternative school in Brooklyn. Weeks later, he received his food handler’s license. He would like to open a restaurant, if his rapping ambitions are not realized. College is probably on the horizon, he said, just not right away.

“I definitely need the break from school,” Mr. Samuel said.

In the spring, Children’s Aid used Neediest Cases funds to buy $150 in gift cards for Mr. Samuel for food and professional clothing — khakis, shirt and tie — for a job search. He currently works in concessions at the Barclays Center and Yankee Stadium.

Mr. Samuel’s sister, now a teenager, remains in the foster care system, and he implores her to learn from his mistakes.

“I tell her, all the homes have rules and you have to abide them,” Mr. Samuel said. “Even if they’re not your family, they’re the reason you’ve got a roof over your head. Go to school, do what you got to do. It’ll be a breeze.”

Those heart-to-heart talks remind him of his delayed progress, and reinforce for him that his recent successes have paved the way for untold opportunity.

“I had a bunch of traffic in that lane,” Mr. Samuel said. “Now it’s clear. I can go straight, and do what I really want to do now.”

Kelly Delivers Fervent Defense of Trump Call to Soldier’s Widow

“Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud,” Mr. Kelly told an unusually hushed room filled with reporters.
“The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.
The movie, which recounted the return of the Marine’s remains, “is worth seeing,” Mr. Kelly said.
“When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country,” Mr. Kelly said.
“We don’t look down upon those of you who haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said before concluding his remarks.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Late Thursday night, Mr. Trump assailed Ms. Wilson in a tweet, accusing her of listening “SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!”

Mr. Kelly struck a tone that was more even, if just as powerful. He displayed scorn for a society that he said does not appreciate the sacrifice of those in the military. “Most of you as Americans don’t know them,” he said, bemoaning that “there’s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate but required.”

A retired Marine general whose son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was slain in battle in 2010, Mr. Kelly has long guarded his personal story of loss even as he served as a high-profile public official. He broke that silence in dramatic fashion on Thursday, offering — from his personal and professional experience — a detailed, even excruciating description of what happens to the remains of those killed in combat, and how the grieving families back home are notified.

“Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud,” Mr. Kelly told an unusually hushed room filled with reporters. “They’re packed in ice, typically at the air head, and then they’re flown to — usually Europe, where they’re then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the medals that they’ve earned, the emblems of their service.”

He testified to the deep pain that parents feel when they get an early-morning knock on the door from an official to tell them that their son or daughter has been killed in action. “The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

And he described the moment that he got the knock on his own door: A military official telling him that his son “was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed,” Mr. Kelly recalled. “He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we were at war.”

Mr. Kelly also revealed, apparently for the first time, that he was standing next to Pfc. Chance Phelps, the subject of the HBO movie “Taking Chance,” as the Marine private was killed by hostile fire in Anbar Province in Iraq. The movie, which recounted the return of the Marine’s remains, “is worth seeing,” Mr. Kelly said.

Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Kelly’s blunt remarks will have impact because of the stark contrast with an administration that has repeatedly lost credibility with the public.

“Its great power was you knew he was telling the truth, and in all specifics,” said Ms. Noonan, a Wall Street Journal columnist. “Kelly comes to the podium and it was credible, and you felt a kind of relief, and respect and gratitude.”

The surprise appearance by Mr. Kelly came after Mr. Trump and the White House were defensively consumed by the president’s actions this week — first, appearing to criticize former presidents for failing to call the families of fallen service members, and later for the words Mr. Trump chose to use in speaking with Sergeant Johnson’s widow.

Their conversation was first revealed by Ms. Wilson, who quoted Mr. Trump as saying that Sergeant Johnson “knew what he signed up for.” The congresswoman told reporters that she and the Johnson family were offended by the president’s bluntness.

Mr. Kelly’s initial grief on Thursday quickly gave way to an anger that was fueled by what he said was an unfair attack on his boss.

He said Mr. Trump was merely trying to express what Mr. Kelly had discussed with the president before the phone call — that soldiers like Sergeant Johnson were doing what they loved, and what they had chosen to do, when they were killed serving the country.

“That’s what the president tried to say to four families,” Mr. Kelly said. He later appeared to attack Ms. Wilson by noting that, during an emotional 2015 ceremony, a congresswoman had crassly claimed political credit for getting funding for an F.B.I. building in Miami that was named for fallen agents. Ms. Wilson’s congressional district includes parts of Miami.

“And we were stunned — stunned that she’d done it,” Mr. Kelly recalled, though he did not name Ms. Wilson. “Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.”

Ms. Wilson’s office declined to respond. The congresswoman also had pushed legislation to quickly name the F.B.I. building.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had not intended to suggest during an impromptu White House news conference on Monday that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had not done enough to honor the fallen. Mr. Trump’s words incensed former Obama administration officials.

Mr. Kelly said that he had advised Mr. Trump that presidents generally do not directly call family members of slain service members, and he confirmed that Mr. Obama had not called him when Lieutenant Kelly was killed — as Mr. Trump had alluded to this week.

“That was not a criticism; that was just to simply say, ‘I don’t believe President Obama called,’” Mr. Kelly said. He said that Lieutenant Kelly’s friends in Afghanistan called him in the hours after his son died, and noted that presidents often write condolence letters to grieving military families instead of calling.

“Those are the only phone calls that really mattered,” Mr. Kelly said, his voice cracking. “And yeah, the letters count, to a degree. But there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.”

Mr. Kelly said that he sought refuge during his trip to the national cemetery, surrounded by the gravestones of service members, some of whom “I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.” Mr. Kelly commanded Marines in Iraq in 2008, one of the bloodiest years of the American-led war there.

But even if he found solace at Arlington National Cemetery, he clearly remained angry on Thursday as he addressed reporters. At one point, he would take questions from anyone who is “a Gold Star parent or sibling.” At another, he described the United States as a place that regularly breaches the sacred trusts that had once underpinned a polite society.

“When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country,” Mr. Kelly said. “Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life, the dignity of life, is sacred. That’s gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.”

Mr. Kelly did not explain his critique or say whether he was referring to Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who embraced politics by speaking on behalf of Hillary Clinton last year at the Democratic National Convention.

Nor did he acknowledge the irony in his comments. Many people accused Mr. Trump of failing to respect Gold Star families by attacking Mr. Khan. And Mr. Trump’s behavior toward women in an “Access Hollywood” tape was seen by many as a failure to respect women.

Instead, Mr. Kelly said that he was “sorry” that most Americans are unfamiliar with the young people who fight in the military on behalf of a country that, in his view, takes them for granted.

“We don’t look down upon those of you who haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said before concluding his remarks. “In fact, in a way, we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our servicemen and women do. Not for any other reason than they love this country.”

“So just think of that,” he said. “And I do appreciate your time.”

Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect. That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts. Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras. The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined — a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.

The Rialto study had a big impact in policing. Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website. A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras. (Results are due out this spring.)

But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington. Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video. The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.

“This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date,” said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues. It was not directly involved in the research. “The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.”

The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more. The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost. In Washington, M.P.D. officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day. About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.

The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations. In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place. Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.

Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.

“D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures,” Mr. Yu said. “In cities that have weaker policies, it’s certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.” Like other advocacy groups, the A.C.L.U. has supported body cameras. But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U. of D.C., “should give us pause.”

For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras. But they admit to being surprised by the findings.

“I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior — particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave,” said the M.P.D. chief, Peter Newsham.

Why didn’t the cameras change behavior? After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior. Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages. Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.

Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, “Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.” Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations — and not elsewhere.

One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them. But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new. (The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.) Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.

An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context. The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters. When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).

“It’s a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior,” said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.

Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, D.C., because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems. After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the city’s police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.

“We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here,” Chief Newsham said.

Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory. (The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)

Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.

To Chief Newsham, the cameras’ primary benefit is to improve relations with the community. “The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I don’t think you can undervalue that,” he said. So far, it’s hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said he’d like to find out more through additional studies like this one.

The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).

“We like to be very anecdotal in policing — to compare this year to that year,” said M.P.D. Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers. “This study is a whole other thing.”

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

I bring this up because I was fortunate to have a few rounds of email correspondence with one of the constructors of today’s puzzle — he happens to be making his New York Times Crossword debut. Each time he wrote, I found myself running to the dictionary to look up at least one of the words that flowed effortlessly from his fingers. And the thing is, he wasn’t doing it to look smart. John Lithgow just is smart.

But at least I now know what a “Savoyard” is. If that makes no sense to you right now, wait until you get to 41D.

Allergan’s deal with the tribe did not extend to the legal battle playing out in the Eastern District of Texas, where manufacturers of generic drugs, including Teva Pharmaceuticals and Mylan, are also fighting Allergan over the validity of the patents. The tribe did not claim sovereign immunity in that case.

In a ruling on Monday, Judge Bryson criticized Allergan’s deal with the tribe and said such arrangements could ultimately damage the country’s patent process.

“Sovereign immunity should not be treated as a monetizable commodity that can be purchased by private entities as part of a scheme to evade their legal responsibilities,” he wrote.

In a statement, Allergan said it was “carefully reviewing the court’s decision.”

The patent office is still reviewing the case, including the Mohawks’ argument that the patents are protected by the tribe’s sovereign immunity. The two legal processes operate independently of each other, although decisions in federal court typically supersede the administrative review, experts said.

“If a court overturns the patent, then that is game over for the patent,” said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law.

Brendan F. White, a spokesman for the tribe, said it was “in the process of reviewing the decision and its impact on our patent business.” Under the deal, Allergan paid the tribe $13.75 million, with the promise of $15 million in annual royalties as long as the patents remained valid.

Allergan’s arrangement with the Mohawk tribe had been greeted with outrage by members of Congress and consumer groups, who said it was just the latest tactic by drug makers to foil generic competitors and protect their profits.

The tribe had countered that it was within its rights and that further deals could serve as an added source of revenue for its community of more than 15,000 people in a rural, economically depressed region near the Canadian border.

Allergan has said it entered into the deal with the tribe to avoid what it described as the double jeopardy of having its patents challenged in both federal court and through the administrative review. Many patent holders have argued that the administrative process is unfair and unnecessary because patents already can be challenged in federal courts.

The review was created by Congress in 2011 as a way to streamline patent challenges by allowing them to be decided by a panel, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The Supreme Court will take up the issue next year in the case Oil States vs. Greene’s Energy Group.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
But what is lost if one of the most recognizable features of football becomes a footnote to the game? Isn’t the huddle’s demonstrated sense of community part of football’s soul?

“The huddle has been romanticized, with good reason,” said Joe Theismann, a Washington Redskins quarterback for 12 seasons and the league’s most valuable player in 1983. “We did it so often. I know people wondered what was going on in there. Personally, I always found it fascinating that the crowd noise would be deafening but the huddle was usually a very, very quiet place.”

Roger Staubach, the fabled leader of the 1970s Dallas Cowboys and a Heisman Trophy winner, said the huddle was the best time to take the pulse of a team.

“As players in the huddle, you’re all alone in the middle of the field but together at the same time,” Staubach said. “You see who is hurt, who’s tired or who’s spitting mad. You can take that all in, which can be powerful.”

Michael Oriard, a former center with the Kansas City Chiefs, an all-American at Notre Dame and the author of books on football culture, called the huddle a sacred place, because it belonged to the players and not the coaches.

“There was bonding and a kind of sharing of intensity,” Oriard, a professor emeritus at Oregon State, said. “Late in a game, you look around at the faces of your teammates and it’s unspoken, or sometimes spoken: ‘This is our last chance before time runs out.’ It’s a communal experience that will be lost.”

Today’s N.F.L. players, for the most part, do not feel the pull of the huddle in the same way.

“There’s always been some allure of the huddle where people imagine Ray Lewis or some star player yelling and pumping up the whole team,” Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said. “That’s an image on TV and in Hollywood movies. But that doesn’t really happen now.

“Everything is happening so much faster that a whole conversation might be communicated in just a look. There’s no time for theatrics.”

Spencer Long, the center for the Washington Redskins, said the terminology of the modern N.F.L. play is so complex it has overwhelmed the traditional huddle.

“We have plays that are like 20 words long — so there goes the break time in the huddle,” Long said. “And each part of that long play call is aimed at a different part of the team. So people’s minds are going in different directions. Frankly, it’s almost as easy to signal all that without taking the time to get together.”

One of Long’s teammates, outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, said the crowd was so noisy during home games that the defensive unit could not hear what was said in a huddle anyway.

“If we have to talk, it’s one-on-one when you shout in someone’s ear,” Kerrigan said.

Defenses in general are growing more averse to huddling. Before each play nowadays, the middle linebacker simply shouts and signals the defensive scheme called by a sideline coach.

The disappearing huddle is also a function of logistics. The N.F.L. is now a pass-happy league, so it is common for a host of players on both sides of the line of scrimmage to have to dash downfield for 50 yards on several successive plays.

“Do you know how much energy I would waste if I had to run back to a huddle after every sprint down the field?” Jenkins said. “That’s why I don’t even try.”

Even the kickers don’t enter a huddle any longer.

“Not really,” Washington’s Dustin Hopkins said. “Everybody already knows their job on the play.”

The origin of the huddle appears to date to the 1890s, when it was first used by players at a school for the deaf, Gallaudet University, where quarterbacks had been communicating to teammates using sign language. Because both teams in games were often from schools for the hearing-impaired, the opposition could easily discern the coming play call by watching the quarterback’s hands.

Gallaudet quarterback Paul Hubbard’s solution was to summon teammates into a huddle that shielded his team’s intentions. The practice spread throughout football, especially as teams left behind primitive, run-only schemes for more sophisticated formations that included forward passes.

Various other universities have staked a claim to inventing the huddle, including Illinois, Georgia and Oregon, although a majority of early 20th century football historians point to Hubbard and Gallaudet, in Washington, D.C.

What is certain is that a huddle soon followed every play as football spiked in popularity. Stories from and about the huddle, a unique convention in a major American sport, began to color the historical narrative of the game, whether it was the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner, Nile Kinnick, exhorting teammates in the huddle during an upset of Notre Dame or Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas reconfiguring his team’s pass routes on the fly in the huddle.

Befitting a rough game in which tempers run hot, the huddle was also the place where teammates clashed and railed against one another for missed tackles or dropped passes. On the flip side, it could also be used as the setting to calm frayed nerves.

In the Super Bowl in 1989, the San Francisco 49ers trailed by 3 points with a little more than three minutes remaining in the game. In the huddle before a final drive that began at the San Francisco 8-yard line, Montana noticed that his teammates seemed more tense than usual, especially tackle Harris Barton. Spotting the comedian and actor John Candy in the stands, Montana tapped Barton and said, “Look, isn’t that John Candy?”

Barton smiled. The 49ers scored the game-winning touchdown in the final minute.

“Sometimes the huddle is the place to make a joke so everyone can relax and just go about their jobs,” Montana recalled later.

The huddle became so prominent culturally it even went through a period of renovation, like a living room redesigned into a more open concept by a home decorator.

Near the middle of the last century, some teams, most notably the Chiefs of the renegade American Football League, chose a more accessible huddle by forming two rows, like a small choir group. Ten players would have their backs turned to the opposition while facing the quarterback as he imparted the play instructions.

Although it is more in vogue than ever, the no-huddle, or hurry-up, offense, has been around for decades.

In the 1980s, Sam Wyche, the coach of the Cincinnati Bengals, introduced the system to the N.F.L.

In the early 1990s, Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly ran a hurry-up offense called the K-Gun that led to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances.

The main objective of the Buffalo offense was to string plays together so rapidly the defense did not have time to insert fresh players or to substitute strategically to better contest something like an obvious passing situation.

That remains a primary goal of the modern N.F.L. no-huddle offense. In fact, Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson called the term “no-huddle” a misnomer.

“It implies we’re rushing, which is not always true,” Watson said. “What we’re really trying to do is outfox the defense. So we’re just not huddling.”

Still, there are times in every N.F.L. game when both teams will universally huddle: during the mandated TV timeouts.

“The TV timeouts are when we can interact,” Giants quarterback Eli Manning said. “You can go over a route change with a wide receiver or talk to your linemen. Guys will be encouraging each other, you know, ‘Two minutes to go, let’s punch it into the end zone.’ It does happen.”

And then play resumes and the team might not convene again until the game is over.

It is a style of football that does not, however, unnerve the youngest players in the N.F.L. Many of them have been playing in no-huddle or hurry-up offenses since they were young teenagers.

“I’ve never huddled,” Chris Moore, the Ravens’ second-year wide receiver, said. “Not in high school or in college. I don’t know any other way.”

But Moore, 24, wonders if he might someday have to learn to huddle.

Why?

Because opposing teams are cracking the no-huddle code words and signals that offenses use to communicate on the field.

“Maybe eventually they’ll get so good at stealing signals,” Moore said, “we’ll have to come back into the huddle so we’re the only ones who know what’s going on.”

Which would mean the huddle would be reborn. In a twist, it would be newly valued for the very thing that brought about its invention in the first place: the need for secrecy.

On Wednesday, 2012 Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney became the latest and most decorated American gymnast to speak out about being sexually abused by Larry Nassar, who served as the USA Gymnastics women’s team doctor for two decades. “It started when I was 13 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn’t end until I left the sport,” Maroney, now 21, wrote of Nassar on Twitter.

“Is it possible for survivors to speak out, without putting careers, and dreams in jeopardy?” Maroney asked. There is increasingly good reason to think that the answer is yes.

Nassar is facing 33 charges of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan and pleaded guilty to federal pornography charges in July; he is expected to spend decades in prison. Last August, the floodgates opened after Rachael Denhollander, who says she was abused by the doctor as a 15-year-old gymnast in Michigan, filed a criminal complaint for sexual assault against Nassar, who was also a faculty member at Michigan State University and team physician at a local club. Now some 140 individuals have accused him of sexual abuse.

After revelations of Nassar’s widespread abuse over several decades, Aly Raisman, a 2012 and 2016 Olympian, criticized USA Gymnastics this summer for its handling of Nassar and for not doing enough to help his victims. She called out the fact that Steve Penny, the former USA Gymnastics president who resigned in March amid criticism that the organization did not act quickly enough, reportedly received a $1 million severance package. Raisman, who has not claimed that she herself suffered abuse, wants to compete in the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Publicly criticizing your sport’s own governing body when you hope to again compete at the highest level is a gutsy move — and a sign of a significant cultural shift in the sport.

Less than a decade ago, an Olympic gold medal gymnast who blew the whistle was iced out of the sport. In 2008, Dominique Moceanu — a wunderkind who won the gold at 14 years old at the 1996 Atlanta Games — claimed that her coaches, Martha and Bela Karolyi, had physically and emotionally abused her. “I never, ever objected to hard work,” she told The Los Angeles Times. “What I objected to was Martha grabbing me by the neck, shoving my face into the phone and telling me to call my parents when I hurt my neck in practice.”

In contrast with Texas after Hurricane Harvey and Florida after Irma, where thousands of repair workers rushed in to restring power lines, only a few hundred electrical workers from outside the island have arrived to help.

It was not until Saturday that the Puerto Rican government said it had the federal funding needed to bring in more workers. And until a week ago, the small Montana company hired to get the lights back on had only 165 workers on the ground; it now has about 300.

In comparison, 5,300 workers from outside the region converged on coastal Texas in the days after Hurricane Harvey to restore a power loss that was about a tenth the size, said Larry Jones, a spokesman for AEP Texas. Electricity was back on for almost everyone within two weeks.

In Florida, 18,000 outside workers went in after Hurricane Irma knocked out electricity to most of the state last month, according to FPL, Florida’s largest power company.

In Puerto Rico, the brunt of the work has been left to the 900 members of local crews.

Industry experts said poor planning, a slow response by power officials and Puerto Rico’s dire financial straits had led to a situation that would be unfathomable in the continental United States. Logistical challenges — like where to house the thousands of extra workers needed to get the lights back on — still have not been resolved.

“Thirty days after the storm, I see very little progress,” said Eduardo Bhatia, an opposition senator who in 2014 wrote an energy reform law. He added, “I don’t see the boots on the field doing the work, and that is a tragedy.”

At the White House on Thursday, President Trump said the administration deserved a 10 for its response to the hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico and other parts of the United States.

But he conceded that the destruction of the power grid was one of Puerto Rico’s biggest long-term challenges, despite the provision of “massive numbers” of generators to temporarily provide electricity to hospitals and other crucial facilities.

“You can’t really bring electric back until you rebuild the power plant,” Mr. Trump said during an appearance with Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico. The federal government will help rebuild the power grid, he said, but “the plant itself is going to take a while.”

In Gurabo, just outside Caguas, Reynaldo De Hostos spends most of his time outside seeking relief from insufferable indoor heat. “Ever since we lost electricity, we can’t sleep,” he said, standing inside his pitch-dark home. Every hour or so at night, he said, he and his family use the air-conditioning in the car for a brief respite.

Even local utility employees are frustrated. “We need trucks, we need poles, we need crews, we need lines, we need more people,” said Javier Hernández Saurí, a lineman who led a team of repair workers making their way up Mr. Rodríguez’s street. “It’s going very slowly.”

He added, “We’re rewiring mostly with materials that can be reused.”

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with restoring Puerto Rico’s power, estimated that it needed at least 2,000 additional workers. So far, the Corps has brought only about 200 workers, and most of them were dedicated not to restoring power but to installing generators at crucial locations.

After major storms, power companies typically rely on mutual aid agreements to get electricity restored. Outside companies send thousands of workers, and electric companies pay for the service with funds from FEMA.

Such agreements are “absolutely critical,” said Devon Streit, the deputy assistant secretary for infrastructure security at the Department of Energy, which is helping to coordinate the restoration of power. But in this instance, some companies were concerned about getting paid, she said, because the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, had filed for bankruptcy protection in July after defaulting on $9 billion in debt.

Ricardo Ramos, chief executive of the power authority, said outside companies had been hesitant to come until they knew where the storm would make landfall. After that, he needed several days to assess the damage, and communications were down.

By the time Mr. Ramos had a full grasp of the damage a week after the storm, he said, the Corps of Engineers had been tasked with overseeing power restoration, a duty outside its usual purview.

That was something of a relief, Mr. Ramos said, because mutual aid agreements cost millions of dollars that the power authority cannot spare.

“With the Corps of Engineers, they do the work, they pay for it, and they get reimbursed by FEMA,” he said. “So it never goes through my pocket.”

The Montana company he hired, Whitefish Energy Holdings, agreed to do the work without a down payment. The chief executive, Andy Techmanski, said that he got the contract because he showed up in Puerto Rico unannounced.

Mr. Ramos expressed no regrets.

“I mobilized what I could, which was private contractors, and I am happy with the decision. I would do exactly the same,” he said. “I think we’re right on target.”

The Corps of Engineers did not announce its large contract, for $240 million, until this week. An earlier $35 million contract was for mobile gas turbines, but the Corps said it did not know when the companies would be sending employees to Puerto Rico.

Brig. Gen. Diana Holland, the commander of the Corps’ South Atlantic Division, said the contracting process went “really quickly,” despite the fact that taxpayers demand a careful review of such emergency contracts.

For now, thousands of power poles remain on the ground. Most Puerto Ricans survive by storing food in ice chests or eating in the few open restaurants. They swat mosquitoes that fly in through the open windows, and some wait in line for hours to get ice. With about a third of the island’s bank branches still closed, lines snake around the block for access to cash machines.

“Last night, someone tried to break into my house and into two of my neighbors’ houses to steal. They tried to force the lock on our door,” said Mario Luis Casanova Caballero, a lineman working with Mr. Hernández Saurí who was using a generator to power his lights and to help keep refrigerators running for three neighbors.

When Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989, Mr. Ramos said, repairs took six months.

But on Saturday, Governor Rosselló committed to a more aggressive timetable, pledging to have 95 percent of power restored by December. His public affairs secretary, Ramón Rosario Cortés, acknowledged that the crews in place were not enough.

“We have 230 brigades. If we used only these brigades, we’d be talking long months — years,” Mr. Rosario said.

The governor said an additional 966 brigades would be trickling in over the next three weeks.

The number of workers, however, is not the only problem. The Corps of Engineers said damage to the island’s ports had slowed shipments of needed equipment, including utility poles and cable.

The task is also daunting, Mr. Ramos said, because some of the power plants date to the 1950s and were never maintained. Power was restored to parts of San Juan three times in the last few weeks, only for the grid to collapse.

As he waits, Mr. Rodríguez tries to get by the best that he can.

Generators are expensive, he said, and hard to find. And lines at the supermarket remain long.

“I buy our drinking water in Costco,” he said. “I made a three-hour line on Sunday to buy eight gallons of water. That’s what we’re surviving on.”

But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.
But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.
I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein.
You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there.
Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power.

“Why not?” I remember him asking. “Because I don’t like vodka, and I don’t like diet soda, and I don’t like them together,” I said. “You are going to drink that,” he insisted. I smiled again and said that I wouldn’t. He gave up and called me stubborn. I said, “I know.” And the meal proceeded without much further ado. In this second encounter with Harvey, I found him to be pushy and idiosyncratic more than anything.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.

幕后故事

Boris Horvat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images 今天是法国抵抗运动的英雄、纳粹大屠杀幸存者斯特凡·埃塞尔的诞辰纪念日。

“当你被一些事激怒时，”他写道，“就像纳粹主义激怒我一样，那就是你变得积极、坚强和参与的时候到了。”

法国抵抗运动的英雄、纳粹大屠杀幸存者斯特凡·埃塞尔(Stéphane Hessel)的诞辰正是1917年的今天。2011年，他以93岁的高龄成为了一个不太可能发生的出版界奇迹，用他的作品《愤怒吧！》(Indignez-Vous)占据了各大图书畅销榜榜首。

《愤怒吧！》仅有约4000字，更像是一本小册子。但它在为总统大选做准备的法国人、在国外抗议欧元区灾难的人、参与“阿拉伯之春”的人以及“占领华尔街”的人中引起了共鸣。

埃塞尔（上图）敦促年轻人通过和平抗议金融市场、法国对非法移民的对待方式、富人对新闻媒体的影响力以及以色列对待巴勒斯坦的方式，来恢复抵抗的精神。

《愤怒吧！》不到一年内在欧洲卖出了300多万本，被翻译成了十余种语言（《国家杂志》[The Nation]用英文刊登了全文）。

埃塞尔于2013年去世，但他让人们愤怒起来的呼声言犹在耳：“你加入历史进程，”他写道，“只有多亏了我们每个人，历史的伟大潮流才能继续奔涌。”

For immigrants living far from their homelands, music — even a few notes of a favorite ballad — can summon a lifetime of memories. With each song come remembrances of a lost love, a long-lost relative, or a lazy summer day. Music can also connect children born in the United States to the rhythms and cultures left behind by their parents.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out.
I love my beachwear — these cute completely insubstantial crocheted cover-ups that come to the elbows.
The whole reason I buy them is to cover up my fat arms on TV.
How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that?
A few years ago, a friend who is a CNN correspondent gave me a pair of sedate post earrings for Christmas.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
These days, my mail includes telephone messages wondering why I wore a white blouse to talk about Chuck Hagel getting fired as defense secretary on “Morning Joe,” emails wondering whether I’m wearing the same necklace as the late Gwen Ifill on “Meet the Press” and Facebook messages from family friends purporting to be proud I’m on TV while also offering up commentary that I shouldn’t wear my favorite black leather jacket when talking about Iran’s nuclear program.

But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out. I googled the return address and found a satellite street image of an ugly red pickup truck parked in a nondescript yard, which told me, well, nothing actually.

I love my beachwear — these cute completely insubstantial crocheted cover-ups that come to the elbows. I have eight of them in different colors, all purchased on Folegandros, this island in Greece that I go to every summer, for $15 each. The whole reason I buy them is to cover up my fat arms on TV. Apparently I was damned if I did and damned if I didn’t.

How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that? After parading the letter around the office in a futile search for reassurance from my guffawing colleagues — do men get such missives? — I took to social media where my Facebook friends were bound to do a better job of buoying me up.

Over the past months, looking for people (other than myself for eating too many bowls of Jollof rice) to blame for the letter, I’ve settled on the city of Washington D.C., where I live and work.

The city is too conservative for my haphazard style. Go to Capitol Hill and it’s a sea of Ann Taylor low-heeled pumps and Talbot’s suits.

In recent years, Washington has played host to two First Ladies — Michelle Obama and now Melania Trump — who have pushed the envelope of what women wear here. But remember the stir when Mrs. Obama bared her arms in her first official photo as First Lady? Or the recent social media storm when Mrs. Trump wore stilettos to a hurricane?

Clearly, I’ve decided, Washington can’t handle too much fashion forwardness. A couple of years ago, I tried on a pair of gorgeous deep red laced-up ankle boots in Paris, and the guy at the cash register stopped me as I was handing him my credit card.

“You live in Washington? You will wear these there?” he said, causing me to pause.

I sighed. “Okay, give me the black pair.” I feel bitter about it every time I put on those black boots.

A few years ago, a friend who is a CNN correspondent gave me a pair of sedate post earrings for Christmas. I had just told her about some blog post that had me in high dudgeon, in which evil bloggers had critiqued the earrings I wore one night on the PBS show “Washington Week.” “There were three tiers to those earrings,” they snarked. “Exactly who costumed Helene? And if this passes for professional dress at The Times these days, color us shocked.”

My friend and I laughed about it, although I was secretly mad, and she sent me a pair of earrings that didn’t dangle to wear next time I went on TV. I promised her I would wear them.

But of course I didn’t.

Keep the conversation going tonight at 7:30 p.m. at Washington, D.C.’s Dupont Underground, where Helene Cooper moderates “From Anchor Suits to Bare-ing Arms,” a panel discussion about the evolution of “Washington fashion.” For more information and to purchase tickets, click here.

“This is the last, best chance we will have to cut taxes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Budget Committee, who warned that the consequences would be ruinous if the party failed.

“That will be the end of us as a party,” he said, “because if you’re a Republican and you don’t want to simplify the tax code and cut taxes, what good are you to anybody?”

Mr. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 1 a.m. to congratulate the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell — whose tensions with the president have been well-documented — for a “first step toward delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for the American people!”

Others were quick to condemn the blueprint. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, declared the budget to be “extremely cruel,” and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said it would burden the middle class.

“This nasty and backwards budget green-lights cuts to Medicare and Medicaid in order to give a tax break to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans,” Mr. Schumer said.

The Senate approved the budget blueprint after considering a flurry of amendments, a tedious process that gives the minority party an opportunity to force the majority to endure politically difficult votes. One Democratic amendment that was rejected sought to stop tax cuts from going to the top 1 percent; another would have restored cuts to Medicare.

The Senate approved the budget after a so-called vote-a-rama, a legislative whirlwind in which amendments are considered one after another. One proposal would have deleted language that could allow for drilling legislation; the amendment failed, 48 to 52.

“The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine areas of the United States, and we have been protecting it for decades for a reason,” said Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

But Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska and the chairwoman of the energy panel, said erasing the language would “deprive us of a substantial opportunity to benefit our country at the same time that we care for our environment.”

In Congress, the annual budget resolution provides an outline of federal spending and revenues. The Senate’s blueprint, for the 2018 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, claims to achieve a balanced budget within a decade, assuming greater economic growth and using an accounting method that excludes Social Security. In order to erase projected deficits, it calls for trillions of dollars in spending cuts over the coming decade.

But the cuts exist only on paper, without legislation to achieve them.

Even so, Democrats sounded the alarm, warning that the aspirational cuts in the budget plan called for slicing more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and about $470 billion from Medicare over a decade.

They also lamented the approach that Republicans are taking on taxes, which mirrors the strategy that they employed in their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On that matter, Republicans successfully laid the groundwork for a repeal measure that could pass without any Democratic votes, but party leaders could not ultimately get 50 Republican senators to agree on a health bill.

Though Democrats have pleaded to have more say in the tax overhaul, parliamentary language in the budget resolution would allow Republicans to pass a tax bill without any cooperation from the minority party. The tax measure could add as much as $1.5 trillion to budget deficits over a decade.

“Passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan. “Passing this budget is only a requirement to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible, without input or buy-in from members of the minority.”

For Republicans, the budget debate provided a moment to showcase their main goal in the coming months: Approving an overhaul of the tax code for the first time in decades, which they hope will lead to greater economic growth.

The House approved its budget resolution, which had long been stalled, on Oct. 5. The House budget also lays the groundwork for a tax bill, but, unlike the Senate’s approach, it calls for the legislation to not add to the deficit.

The House budget resolution also seeks more concrete action when it comes to cutting spending, instructing committees to come up with legislation that would produce at least about $200 billion in savings.

The chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, had seemed reluctant to jettison that piece of the blueprint. “What part of ‘cut spending’ does @SenateGOP not understand?” she wrote on Twitter last week. But Senate Republicans have shown no appetite to make spending cuts in tandem with the tax overhaul.

VARIETY PUZZLE — I’ve known about cryptic crosswords for a long time, but I always thought that I would never be able to solve them, what with all those mystifying clues. Shame on me.

When Will Shortz ran Brian Greer’s American crossword debut in The New York Times in June, we learned that Mr. Greer, a former crossword editor for The Times of London, had succeeded in also having a cryptic crossword run on the same day, with the same Harry Potter-based theme, in The Times. As far as we know, that had never happened before, so it seemed to be an ideal time for a Facebook Live puzzle swap across the pond. The current editor of The Times solved The New York Times’s crossword in London and Mr. Greer, Mr. Shortz and I solved their cryptic crossword here in the States.

I’m not sure why, but that experience really piqued my interest in cryptic crosswords. I spent the summer reading “how to” books (including Mr. Greer’s), trying to solve cryptic crosswords and am now a big fan of these puzzles. That’s a good thing, because I’ve been told there will be a fairly large number of British people making the crossing on the Times Journeys trans-Atlantic crossword cruise in December, so I can say that I am conversant. Or at least sound like I am.

Am I an expert? Not at all. But it’s a vastly different mental tug-of-war between the solver, setter and editor than the American-style crosswords I’m used to, and it’s a very pleasurable break for me. More important, as much as I would love to be an expert right this very minute, learning takes time, patience and practice, and I am loving the journey.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect. That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts. Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras. The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined — a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.

The Rialto study had a big impact in policing. Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website. A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras. (Results are due out this spring.)

But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington. Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video. The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.

“This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date,” said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues. It was not directly involved in the research. “The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.”

The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more. The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost. In Washington, M.P.D. officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day. About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.

The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations. In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place. Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.

Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.

“D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures,” Mr. Yu said. “In cities that have weaker policies, it’s certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.” Like other advocacy groups, the A.C.L.U. has supported body cameras. But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U. of D.C., “should give us pause.”

For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras. But they admit to being surprised by the findings.

“I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior — particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave,” said the M.P.D. chief, Peter Newsham.

Why didn’t the cameras change behavior? After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior. Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages. Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.

Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, “Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.” Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations — and not elsewhere.

One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them. But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new. (The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.) Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.

An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context. The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters. When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).

“It’s a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior,” said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.

Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, D.C., because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems. After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the city’s police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.

“We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here,” Chief Newsham said.

Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory. (The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)

Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.

To Chief Newsham, the cameras’ primary benefit is to improve relations with the community. “The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I don’t think you can undervalue that,” he said. So far, it’s hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said he’d like to find out more through additional studies like this one.

The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).

“We like to be very anecdotal in policing — to compare this year to that year,” said M.P.D. Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers. “This study is a whole other thing.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — If you believe The Doctor — and please don’t ask me which one — time is not a linear progression the way we Earthlings experience it. Rather, it is a big ball of “wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff.”

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

“A student is a consumer of the product of education,” he said in an interview this week. “Greater transparency is going to empower the consumer.”

The pair’s efforts could also provide a road map for people who do not want to be tripped up by the complexity, and it starts with the Net Price Calculator Improvement Act. These calculators, which allow college shoppers to input data and get a rough sense of how much financial aid a school might offer them, have not been warmly embraced by many colleges. As I’ve reported in the past, some have even blocked third-party efforts to make it easier for families to compare the results that the calculators spit out.

To the senators, these calculators are vital, given that too many families dismiss colleges with high sticker prices out of hand, without realizing that few people pay the sticker price at many private colleges anymore. So their bill would force schools to put the calculator on the same webpage where families look for cost and admission information. Plus, it would encourage the Department of Education to develop a universal calculator containing the data of every college, which would make comparisons easier.

Bill No. 2 is the Understanding the True Cost of College Act, but a better name for it might be the Colleges Don’t Write Very Clear Financial Aid Award Letters Act. When a college offers you aid before you’ve decided whether or not to attend, it sends you a letter with a bunch of numbers that purport to explain it all. These letters, however, are often so badly crafted that some of Senator Franken’s constituents complained that they could not tell whether they were being offered grants (which they did not have to pay back) or loans (which they generally did).

Part of the problem comes from industry jargon. There are descriptive terms or loan names that financial aid administrators believe they must use to comply with regulations, and others, like “Fed Direct Unsub Loan,” that simply exist nowhere else in the English language. Yet they stuff the letters full of them and send them off to teenagers.

“Most financial aid administrators mean well,” said Brendan Williams, director of knowledge for uAspire, which helps students and others decode the financial aid system. “But sometimes they lose sight of where students are when getting these letters. It’s a foreign language almost.”

The True Cost bill would mandate the use of a standard template for award letters, so that recipients would have a clear sense of what college would cost, how much money they might have to borrow and how much grant money was being offered, free and clear.

“Let people compare apples to apples instead of apples to oranges,” Senator Grassley said.

This could — and should — have happened a long time ago, for it’s not a new issue. In 2007, Kim Clark, who was a colleague of mine at Fortune Magazine 20 years ago, used a fellowship to set up a website explaining just how confusing many award letters were. Her “decoder” feature translated a handful of actual letters so that people could cut through the muddle.

Several years after that, a clear-as-day sample letter appeared on the Department of Education’s website, but schools were not forced to use it. Many refuse to do so to this day. Why is this?

“They don’t want to make it easy to understand the true costs and to compare them,” said Ms. Clark, who now works for the Education Writers Association. Tweedy traditionalists, after all, don’t want a price war to get in the way of the gauzy appeal of reputation, tradition and other things that are hard to put a value on.

Mr. Williams, whose organization would not exist but for the absurd complexity of the system, has some sympathy for the writers of said letters.

“It’s their job to communicate with students, and, let’s be honest really, to try to get students to enroll at their college,” he said.

Still, he has no patience for common practices like formatting letters to count loans as “awards,” as if the school were doing families some kind of a favor. “It drives me bonkers,” he said.

The third bill, the Know Before You Owe Act, co-sponsored with Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, is aimed at giving students a running total of their debt and its ramifications during each year at school. Currently, students get some loan counseling on the way in and some more on the way out, but that’s it, and it’s often not very good.

If this bill passes, the annual check-in will include an explanation of students’ projected debt-to-income ratio based on the average salary for people in their major. Borrowers would also have to manually enter the amount of federal loans they wished to use, so that they’d be making a conscious decision about debt and not simply checking a box to grab everything they were eligible to borrow.

These bills will probably not get much of a hearing on their own, so they’re more likely to be included in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Whether that will happen (as it is supposed to) in the next year or so is anyone’s guess.

In the meantime, there is nothing stopping you from doing all of the things that these bills would make the schools do for you. Use a search engine to find the net price calculator for the schools that interest you, as some schools hide them on their sites. You can also go to College Abacus’s website to compare the results from different schools, if the schools haven’t blocked College Abacus’s tool, that is.

Once the award letters start arriving, consult Ms. Clark’s letter-reading advice that ran in Money Magazine. You should also look at the Institute for College Access and Success’s tips for interpreting the documents and the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators’ glossary.

As for do-it-yourself counseling, consult the column I wrote two years ago in which I asked young adults with debt to discuss the things about the system that they wished someone had told them when they were 18 years old.

Meanwhile, any bipartisanship is cause for encouragement and celebration.

“We’re kind of an odd couple, Franken and I,” Senator Grassley said. “But I hope it also holds a lesson.”

He wants us to know that we can all get along, really. So noted. But the lesson for me is that this blasted system has grown so complex that even people who normally disagree have concluded that it is an enormous problem. So there is little doubt, bills or not, that it will take a very long time before the process of fixing it comes to the end.

In his letter on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont mentioned the arrest of the two leaders as evidence of Spain’s repressive stance.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
“A bad situation has become even worse today,” said Argelia Queralt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Barcelona. “Neither side seems really willing to yield an inch, which means there is only a very limited chance of any positive outcome to this conflict.”

The Catalan government has said that 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum supported independence. But Mr. Rajoy’s government and the courts had declared the vote illegal, and the police officers sent to block polling places wounded hundreds in clashes.

Only about 40 percent of the Catalan electorate took part, after Madrid advised those who opposed secession to stay away from polling stations.

The latest statements from each side now move the dispute to the brink of a potentially explosive confrontation.

Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, spokesman for the Spanish government, said at a news conference that Madrid was ready to use “all the means within its reach to restore the legality and constitutional order as soon as possible.”

Yet such steps are fraught with uncertainty in a country that adopted its democratic constitution only in 1978, after the death of its longtime dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco.

Last week, Mr. Rajoy initiated a request to invoke a broad and forceful tool that has never before been used — Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution — which would allow him to take direct control of Catalonia.

He said he could resort to such a step if Mr. Puigdemont did not clearly back down from a threat to declare independence.

But on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont sent a defiant letter to Mr. Rajoy, blaming him for escalating the conflict by refusing to meet and negotiate.

“If the government continues to prevent dialogue and maintains the repression,’’ he wrote, “the Parliament of Catalonia could go ahead, if it deems it opportune, and vote the formal declaration of independence.”

Officials in Madrid have repeatedly warned in recent days that Mr. Rajoy would consider anything short of a clear withdrawal of the declaration of independence to be unacceptable, after what he deemed an unsatisfactory response from Mr. Puigdemont on Monday.

Article 155 would give Madrid the authority to suspend Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan lawmakers, and to take charge of the region’s autonomous administration, including the Catalan broadcaster and autonomous police force, although Mr. Rajoy has not publicly committed to an emergency intervention.

It is unclear what Mr. Rajoy will propose to his cabinet on Saturday, but he may try to gradually raise pressure on the fragile coalition of Catalan separatists rather than risk a forceful intervention that could further galvanize the independence movement.

José Luis Ábalos, an official from the main opposition Socialist party, indicated at a news conference on Thursday that the party would support Mr. Rajoy — as long as the prime minister made limited and short use of Article 155, and also somehow kept “self-government” in Catalonia.

Using constitutional powers, Mr. Rajoy could appoint a caretaker administration in Catalonia. Mr. Puigdemont, on the other hand, could face sedition charges and ultimately a long prison sentence for presenting a unilateral declaration of independence that violates Spain’s Constitution.

Politicians in Madrid have recently demanded that Catalonia hold regional elections as soon as possible, but Mr. Puigdemont made no mention of such a vote in his letter on Thursday.

The separatist leaders of Catalonia are already claiming that Madrid has used disproportionate means to push them out of office, with the help of the Spanish police and the courts.

About 200,000 demonstrators gathered on Tuesday in central Barcelona, according to the local police, to demand the release of two separatist leaders who were sent to prison without bail, pending a trial on sedition charges. In his letter on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont mentioned the arrest of the two leaders as evidence of Spain’s repressive stance.

Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, is an important engine of the Spanish economy. Independence aspirations have built in recent years over a host of social and economic grievances.

Those tensions grew as Mr. Rajoy and Catalan leaders talked past one another, turning the kind of dispute that might have been defused years ago into a full-blown constitutional crisis.

The rising uncertainty and the threat of declaring independence have already prompted hundreds of companies to relocate their headquarters outside Catalonia, further straining the unwieldy separatist coalition that holds a majority of the seats in the regional Parliament.

Hard-line secessionists want an abrupt and unilateral rupture with the central government in Madrid, while conservative and more moderate separatists are increasingly worried about the economic consequences for Catalonia.

Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, told Parliament on Thursday that the relocation of Catalan companies was “only an appetizer of what could happen if independence was confirmed — something that the government will not allow.”

Mr. Puigdemont sent his latest letter after an emergency meeting of his conservative party late Wednesday, during which lawmakers gave clear support for not withdrawing the declaration of independence, according to local news reports.

Still, secessionism has divided Catalonia. Separatist parties won control of the regional Parliament in 2015, but with only 48 percent of the vote.

Núria Marín, the Socialist mayor of L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, just southwest of Barcelona, said on Thursday that politicians on both sides should take the blame for plunging Catalonia into a crisis.

“I believe that with threats on the part of one side or the other, we won’t now solve this situation,” she said. “We are sadly seeing that companies are leaving while we are sending letters to one another.”

Whatever the government decides on Saturday, the Catalan crisis is set to drag on: Mr. Rajoy would need approval from the Senate before intervening in Catalonia.

Mr. Rajoy’s governing Popular Party has a majority in the Senate, and Podemos, a far-left party, is the only major opposition group that is opposed to using Article 155 in Catalonia. Instead, Podemos has suggested that Spain should hold a nationwide referendum over Catalonia’s future statehood.

Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, said Thursday morning that “Spain can’t appear to be like a banana republic that has problems of democracy.” He added, “We don’t want to threaten or repress Catalonia, but we want to convince Catalonia that Spain is a collective project that is worth it.”

The first sign of unsettlement is when Carl starts bringing mismatched chairs to Jody’s shop, where the play takes place, claiming his own apartment is too small. As the chairs progressively take over the space, we learn that Jody has stopped going home. He hasn’t been tested, he tells Carl, and does not want to leave the comfort of his familiar, mapped-out little universe anymore.

Mr. Dietz never says what Jody has not been tested for, but the two protagonists are gay men in the early 1990s, and conclusions are easy to draw that it is AIDS. This is par for the course in “Lonely Planet,” which makes liberal use of symbols and metaphors, yet manages to be heavy-handed while not spelling things out.

Most obviously, Jody uses cartography to evoke the way he sees the world, as when he talks about the flat Mercator map — which misrepresents the size of countries, with those farther away from the Equator appearing larger — and makes us accept “the distortion as fact.”

Jody is also seen reading Ionesco’s absurdist, despairing, agonizingly elliptical play “The Chairs.” “Is it the one with the hippos?” Carl quips. But under his flip exterior — and Mr. McGrath makes hay of Carl’s wit — the show’s resident jester is angry at the disease that is killing his friends.

The chairs he is amassing in Jody’s store belonged to people who just died; they are totems of snuffed-out lives. At least Carl confronts the plague in his own way, and he is getting frustrated and scared by Jody’s denial of reality.

In the plain, affectless staging by Jonathan Silverstein, Mr. Burton and Mr. McGrath expertly underplay the characters, with their roiling fears and, in Carl’s case, outrage. You may wish, at times, for a dash of immoderation, but the show’s deceptively gentle approach is also what makes it stand apart in our angry times.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, Sallie Hofmeister, said that “Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of nonconsensual sex.”

Mr. Ring declined to provide details of the allegation, but his client spoke to The Los Angeles Times.

The woman, now 38, said the assault took place in February 2013, after Mr. Weinstein approached her in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel, where she was staying, and asked her to invite him to her room. After she refused and went upstairs, Mr. Weinstein appeared at her door anyway and entered the room.

Mr. Weinstein “became very aggressive and demanding and kept asking to see me naked,” she told The Los Angeles Times.

She said that after she would not give in to his bullying and coercion, he dragged her into the bathroom and raped her.

“He grabbed me by the hair and forced me to do something I did not want to do,” she told the newspaper.

“He made me feel like an object,” she said, “like nothing with all his power.”

[ Read The New York Times recaps of “Star Trek: Discovery” here. ]

The series’ most promising innovation has been making the protagonist not the crew’s captain but an outsider. Burnham, a human raised by the superrational Vulcans, wants to redeem herself but resists Lorca’s any-means-necessary ruthlessness. (Ms. Martin-Green’s ice-cool performance is layered, but it’s a handicap for a series to center on a character who’s trained to suppress emotion.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Burnham exemplifies many of the ideals that we once saw in captains Kirk, Picard et al. — respect for the rights of sentient species, the sense of wonder in exploration, restraint in the use of science. But amid the wartime exigencies of “Discovery” these notions are under siege, not ascendant. The potentially fruitful question of “Discovery” is to ask: what happens to your principles when they become inconvenient?

But a little more than halfway through the season’s first eight-episode run (the “second chapter” begins in January), the story lacks momentum. The dialogue is stilted. The chemistry among the still-forming central team is shaky. The series doesn’t have a voice so much as a mood, and that mood is, usually, a bummer.

Some fans have complained that “Discovery” has betrayed the idealistic, optimistic spirit of its earlier fleetmates. I don’t think that’s the problem. “Star Trek” is a kind of national mythology, and it has every right, maybe even the creative obligation, to change to suit its times. (Weirdly, Fox’s joke-not-a-joke “The Orville” is more slavishly like the original series.) Two decades ago, “Deep Space Nine” (for my money the best “Trek”) also focused on the compromises of war.

Rather, “Discovery” feels like it’s adrift between the adventure-of-the-week format of its network-TV predecessors and the kind of complex serial favored by cable and streaming. It has the trappings of serious pay-TV drama: darkness, willingness to kill major characters “Game of Thrones”-style, even profanity. (This “Trek” sets its phasers to “F.”) But they’re mostly superficial.

The most direct antecedent for “Discovery” might not be any “Trek” series but the 2004–09 reboot of “Battlestar Galactica.” That series was also a bleaker riff on a previous series, turning the struggle of humanity against the Cylons — a society of robots that mankind created — into one of the best fictional treatments of the war on terror. Ingeniously, it rethought the Cylons as monotheistic zealots, murderous but with a culture and ideals that could not be easily dismissed.

It would seem that “Discovery” wants to do something similar for the Klingons, the alien enemies (and eventually, allies) who, here, have just united against the Federation. Here, they’re isolationists whose rallying cry — “Remain Klingon!” — one producer has said intentionally echoes Trump-era nationalism.

These Klingons also have elements of cultlike fanaticism, and there’s reference to their having carried out “terrorist” attacks. (They’ve also gotten a makeover, with more prominent prosthetics than their old forehead ridges.) The result is a generic, bellicose mishmash of an enemy, whose subtitle-heavy scenes slow the show down rather than add depth.

There are flashes of promise, especially in the supporting characters. Doug Jones stands out as Lieutenant Saru, whose sensitivity to danger comes from belonging to a species that was bred as prey. His genetically wired wariness, like the spore-drive story, suggests a “Trek” attuned to biology like its predecessors were to physics.

“Discovery” can be effectively eerie and moody. But it’s not urgent or inventive in a way that cuts through the somberness. Dimming the lights, it turns out, does not automatically give you a better view of the stars.

How to Walk Out of the Louvre With a Masterpiece

The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution.
Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband.
With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect.
Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

Who were those masked constructors? Thanks for the weekend rescue, Mr. Agard and Ms. Briñas.

At Al Smith Dinner, Paul Ryan’s Best Jokes Are Aimed at Trump

Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York and a host of the event, and Mr. Ryan, a fellow Roman Catholic, go way back.
By Cardinal Dolan’s telling, they have been friends since 2002, when he became the archbishop of Milwaukee and Mr. Ryan was a representative from his Wisconsin district.
As a result, he has unfailingly spoken highly of Mr. Ryan over the years in public remarks, even when liberal Catholics have taken Mr. Ryan to task for supporting policies they feel would hurt the poor and vulnerable.
Thursday night was no different, with Cardinal Dolan calling Mr. Ryan’s virtue and sense of duty uplifting.
About 50 denounced Mr. Ryan on the issue of immigration, criticizing him for failing to support the continuation of DACA, which shields undocumented immigrants who arrived as children from deportation.

“Every morning I wake up in my office and I scroll through Twitter to see which tweets I will have to pretend I didn’t see later on,” he added. “Every afternoon former Speaker John Boehner calls me up, not to give advice, just to laugh.”

Mr. Ryan’s address was the highlight of the event, officially the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, which raised $3.4 million for charity but which at times lacked the panache and elegance of past years. For the first time since 1945, the annual dinner was not held in the classic Art Deco ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria hotel, which is under renovation. Instead, it was a few blocks away at the less glamorous New York Hilton Midtown.

“We are going to try to get back there as quickly as we can,” Mary Callahan Erdoes, the new vice chairwoman of the foundation, told the more than 800 guests in a near-apology.

Also missing were the political jabs of Alfred E. Smith IV, the great-grandson of the dinner’s eponym, who stepped down as master of ceremonies after last year’s dinner after serving in that position for 35 years. This year’s host, the actress Patricia Heaton, was unfailingly nice, which meant she was shocked by how aggressive some of the jibes from the dais were.

“I am from Ohio,” she explained. “We are all so nice to each other!”

The two United States senators from New York, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, were missing from their seats on the 50-member dais, because they had a vote in Washington. But Mayor Bill de Blasio, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and former Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg and David N. Dinkins were there, along with numerous Catholic leaders and local dignitaries.

Mr. Bloomberg got a particularly warm round of applause when he was introduced. Mayor de Blasio, however, got repeated boos from a moneyed crowd that was not shy about identifying as Republican.

Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York and a host of the event, and Mr. Ryan, a fellow Roman Catholic, go way back. By Cardinal Dolan’s telling, they have been friends since 2002, when he became the archbishop of Milwaukee and Mr. Ryan was a representative from his Wisconsin district.

Outside the event, meanwhile, protesters made themselves known. About 50 denounced Mr. Ryan on the issue of immigration, criticizing him for failing to support the continuation of DACA, which shields undocumented immigrants who arrived as children from deportation. Another group of about 100 protesters marched by the hotel, chanting, “You build that wall, we’ll tear it down.”

Being Republican in a town not used to them was another theme in Mr. Ryan’s remarks, which were met with appreciative laughter. He joked about how amazing Ms. Heaton was, as a Republican in that most Democratic of elite worlds, Hollywood.

“Patricia Heaton is a Hollywood Republican, a Hollywood Republican,” he repeated. “That is an oxymoron, which clearly was the word that Rex Tillerson was searching for.”

An eclectic mix of accessories and clothing boutiques, home-goods shops like Sayville General Store and some 23 restaurants can be found in the hamlet, along with a four-screen movie theater. “Sayville has such a charm about it, and there is a pride among the residents,” said Angie M. Carpenter, the Islip town supervisor.

“They hold many country-like festivals” — like the Sayville Apple Festival, on Oct. 21, at the Islip Grange — “throughout the year,” she said. “There is a real sense of community.”

“The Porch Is Open” reads a sign on the wraparound front porch of the 100-year-old house that Cathy Cohen, 75, has lived in for 48 years. “Neighbors party on it all the time,” Ms. Cohen said. “Even when I’m not home.”

During Ms. Cohen’s 65-year tenure in Sayville, the hamlet has grown and “changed tremendously,” she said. The dairy farm she used to walk to is long gone, and once-vacant lots are now filled with “huge tracts of housing.” Yet the affability remains in what she said is still “a quaint village.”

There are “an amazing amount of people who never left,” Ms. Cohen said. “They grew up, their kids grew up, and generations down, they are still here. It is a great place for raising a family.”

What You’ll Find

Victorians abound. South of Montauk Highway, the main east-west thoroughfare, grandes dames are set back on deep lots along broad, shady avenues stretching south to the bay.

“A sprinkling of homes have docks,” said Andrea Casey, a salesperson with Century 21 Bay’s Edge Realty. While most of the coastline is reserved for commercial and public use, houses along Sunset Drive and West Lane back up to canals.

At the tip of Foster Avenue, Sayville Marina Park’s three tennis courts, sandy beach and boat docks dominate the waterfront. Nearby, manicured gardens and a gazebo at Land’s End Caterers provide a picturesque bay-front setting for weddings, said Manon Compitello, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who lives in Sayville.

North of Montauk Highway, there are newer two-story houses built on three-quarter-acre lots on cul-de-sacs. Capes and ranches occupy smaller lots. Condos, co-ops, age-restricted rental apartments and an assisted-living facility line Lakeland Avenue, the thoroughfare stretching north to Sunrise Highway’s big box shopping areas.

What You’ll Pay

“We get a lot of first-time home buyers who want to be in Sayville,” said Leesa Byrnes, broker-owner of Leesa Byrnes Realty. A three-bedroom, two-bath ranch in good shape on a quarter-acre lot, she said, will run between $375,000 and $400,000. Homes that need work range from the low- to mid-$300,000s, while trade-up homes with four bedrooms and two and a half baths on half-acre lots will cost about $650,000.

On Oct. 11, there were 39 houses and nine condominiums on the market. The priciest, at $1,199,000, was a restored five-bedroom 1890 Victorian with an in-ground pool on a half-acre. The least expensive, at $245,000, was a two-bedroom, one-level condo at the age-restricted Sunrise Village, a gated community built in 1987.

Good schools are a draw, Ms. Compitello said, and because Sayville is not incorporated, “you get all the benefits of a town without a village tax.”

But “one of our biggest struggles is our lack of inventory” coupled with “lots of buyers,” she added, noting that homes are selling faster and at higher prices than a year ago. The average sales price in 2017, through Oct. 11, was $453,736, a 5.8 percent increase over the average price of the same period the previous year, $428,691.

The Vibe

Locals buzz about plans for the former Island Hills Golf Club, at the hamlet’s northern edge. Developers Gregg and Mitchell D. Rechler, who bought the property last year, have been meeting with community groups, hoping to change the single-family zoning to build Greybarn, a multifamily rental community with 1,378 apartments “geared to keep millennials and downsizers close to home,” Gregg Rechler said.

Clustered in three- and four-story buildings, with rooflines and eaves resembling large Hamptons-style summer houses, the property is being designed to “benefit the people who already live in the community, as well as the residents who live in Greybarn,” Mr. Rechler said. A 22-acre “perimeter park around the property that equates to a two-mile walking and bike trail will have various pocket parks as it goes along,” he continued, including a playground, an exercise park and a dog park. Plans also call for a community farm, a pond, multiple swimming pools and a large clubhouse with a fitness center and screening rooms.

A shuttle will take residents from Greybarn to stores and restaurants downtown.

The Schools

There are 2,948 students in the well-regarded Sayville public schools, which draw from Sayville and West Sayville.

Students in kindergarten through grade five attend Cherry Avenue Elementary School, Lincoln Avenue Elementary School or Sunrise Drive Elementary School. Grades six to eight are served by Sayville Middle School. Students move up to Sayville High School for grades nine to 12.

The latest available mean SAT scores were 533 in reading, 564 in math and 521 in writing, compared to New York State scores of 489, 501 and 477.

Some Sayville properties are zoned for the Connetquot Central School District.

The Commute

Commuters to Manhattan, 56 miles west, can catch a train at the Sayville station on the Babylon branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour rides to Penn Station take from an hour and 16 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes. Most trips to Manhattan require changing trains in Jamaica or Babylon. The monthly fare is $391.

The History

Once the South Side Railroad reached Sayville in 1868, the hamlet became a summer resort. Actors and actresses stayed in hotels and rented houses in the area. From 1909 to 1919, a seasonal trolley — initially horse-drawn, later electric — connected the railroad station with hotels along Candee Avenue, said George J. Munkenbeck, the Islip town historian.

The New York Times

Weeks after Equifax acknowledged that hackers had breached the company’s system, the company’s interim chief executive, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., apologized for its messy response. The breach meant that potentially millions of Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other information had been stolen, leaving many of us to wonder how vulnerable we might be to identity theft.

“Answers to key consumer questions were too often delayed, incomplete or both,” Mr. Barros wrote in an op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal in late September.

He had his verb tenses wrong. The answers are still delayed and incomplete.

Many of you have asked us to put all we know in one place, so you’ll find my first attempt at that here. You’ll find questions and answers on a range of topics, from credit freezes to PINs to protecting the information of your children.

All the statements here from Equifax were emailed, as people representing the company have so far refused to speak with me on the record.

Did I miss anything, or is something here not actually happening? Drop me a note at lieber@nytimes.com and I’ll try to figure out why. My email tally on this matter is now over 2,000 messages, and while I’m trying to respond to every one, I can’t promise that I’ll get to them all.

What’s Happened?

How do I know if I’ve been affected by the Equifax breach?

Equifax has a website where you can check. The company will not inform you otherwise, even though it has your address (which was one of the things that the hackers helped themselves to).

But even if your name doesn’t appear on the website, it’s probably a good idea to freeze your credit anyway.

Why is freezing important? When a thief shows up with your Social Security number and address to apply for credit in your name, the lender will try to fetch your credit report before anything else happens. If it can’t retrieve the report because of the freeze, then no new account for the thief.

I’ve used the Equifax site a few times in the last several weeks and have received different answers about whether I was affected. How do I know which answer is the right answer?

Updated: Oct. 16 The company refused to directly answer this. My guess is that it is not completely certain whose information was stolen (and that its website still isn’t functioning properly). You should protect yourself accordingly.

I keep seeing different information about what the thieves actually stole. Could you please list all of it?

Updated: Oct. 7 According to the company, thieves took names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses for up to 145.5 million people. They also helped themselves to some smaller number of driver’s license numbers.

Thieves may have your credit card number, too; this is the case for more than 200,000 people, and Equifax has said that it let those people know by mail.

Equifax has said that it has no evidence of a breach in its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases, so your payment history is not floating around in the ether somewhere. Nor did the thieves get PINs that people use to unlock their frozen credit files.

Oh, and TransUnion and Experian (especially Experian, which has a similar name to Equifax) very much want you to know that their systems are not part of this particular breach.

Why are people so freaked out about this, and what is the worst-case scenario for a victim of identity theft?

New: Oct. 12 In theory, your financial losses are limited once you prove you are truly a victim. The Federal Trade Commission explains those limits well.

But the mess that an identity theft can create with your credit — and the time that it takes to fix problems every time they pop up, often for many years — is incalculable.

Drew Armstrong wrote a good first-person piece for Bloomberg that lays out some of the headaches, including the mortgage, tax and airport troubles one can encounter.

What Should I Do About It?

How do I freeze my credit file?

You can — and you should — set up a freeze on the websites of all three credit bureaus. There may be fees associated with doing it.

Don’t trust the security of the companies’ sites? Try calling them instead.

Equifax Experian TransUnion 1-800-685-1111 1-888-397-3742 1-888-909-8872 Note: If you call Experian, ignore the warning to call Equifax instead and the effort to get you to go online. Listen and wait for the freeze prompt that comes eventually.

A warning about the phone systems: The process may end with you receiving a PIN you’ll need when you want to thaw your credit file (say, when you apply for a car loan or credit card sometime in the future).

The automated phone system may give you the PIN quickly, without much warning and without repetition, so be ready to write it down.

Why freeze at all three bureaus? Because thieves might take your stolen data and apply for credit at a lender or other company that only checks Experian or TransUnion files. If you haven’t frozen those files, then you’re vulnerable.

If you’re married, both you and your spouse should freeze your files, since the companies maintain separate files for every adult that they track.

Are there any other credit reporting agencies with whom I should initiate a freeze?

New: Oct. 12 I suggest setting up freezes at Innovis, a smaller firm, and ChexSystems, which helps banks check up on new account applicants.

Were the PINs for thawing freezes compromised in this breach?

No, according to Equifax.

For the people who got their PINs in the mail, why does Equifax write “Equifax Security Freeze” on the return envelope, giving thieves a signal that valuable information is inside?

New: Oct. 12 Equifax said it was looking into this, and I will update when I learn more.

If I had an Equifax freeze before, do I need to refreeze due to the breach?

No, the freeze is still in place. But the freeze did not prevent your information from being exposed by the breach.

Freezes at Equifax are free through January. Why not make them free for life?

Updated: Oct. 12 The company would not directly address the freeze question in the statement it sent me, but it seems to prefer locks over freezes, and promises to make locking and unlocking free for life as of Jan. 31. For more on the difference between freezes and locks, see this article about Experian’s decision not to offer free locks.

Thanks to those of you who have told me that Equifax’s automated freeze phone line is still telling them that freezes are free only through November. That information is wrong, and the company has generally proven to be slow in correcting its own systems after making policy changes in recent weeks.

Will thawing a frozen Equifax file also be free through January?

Updated: Oct. 2 Yes.

For people who paid for freezes after the breach announcement — but before Equifax made them temporarily free — will the company automatically refund their credit cards?

The company has said that it will, but I wouldn’t count on it happening. After all, its website was still charging many people days after the announcement that the company was lifting the fees.

If you have not seen a refund yet, dispute the charge with your credit card company when it shows up on your bill.

Does freezing my credit file hurt my credit score?

New: Oct. 12 No, according to all three companies.

Does freezing my credit file make it harder for me to instantly get my free credit report from annualcreditreport.com?

New: Oct. 12 No, according to the three companies. But many readers beg to differ. One, Pete Ho, found it impossible to get his Equifax report from the site, but the minute he lifted his freeze he received the report with no problem.

How Do I Navigate the Balky Systems?

If people are having problems with Equifax’s various websites, where is the best place to call to reach someone who knows what he or she is talking about?

Updated: Oct. 12 According to the company, the best number to dial for help is 1-866-447-7559.

The line is open seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern time.

After I first posted it, a reader called to tell me that the phone representatives at the above number did not know how to deal with questions about freeze PINs. Instead, they gave him another number to call, where the recorded voice touted “the hottest triple-X hardcore service.” (We checked.)

There seems to be no shortage of other numbers to try nor an easy way to figure out which ones are good for which questions. But readers have written in to say they found success with these:

• 1-865-410-8643

• 1-888-548-7878

“We acknowledge that some customers have experienced difficulty getting answers and support through our call centers and apologize for any inconvenience,” an Equifax spokesman said. “We have worked hard to improve the experience with our call centers. Call center performance is being monitored daily.”

Why were the PINs for security freezes based, until recently, entirely on the date and time that you made the freeze?

The procedure could suggest a casual approach to security at the company.

Equifax, for its part, said it had “confidence” in the old system but that it understood people’s concerns and would allow them to change their PINs. All new PINs, as of a few weeks ago, are randomly generated.

How should people with the old PINs (with the non-random numbers) change them?

Updated: Oct. 16 If someone wants a new PIN, they must call 1-866-349-5191 to speak to a live agent and provide identity verification information to receive a replacement PIN by mail.

Readers report having success with another process, too. They say they call, cancel their old freezes and then immediately start new ones to receive new PINs.

Where and how does Equifax store these PINs?

Many of you asked if they are stored with a higher level of security than the company deployed elsewhere, like where the breach had occurred. And what would Equifax say to people who, given the company’s perceived security failings, are worried that their PINs are vulnerable?

No answer on this one yet, and I don’t expect one either, for security reasons.

Is Equifax’s monitoring service groaning under the strain of all the new members?

Updated Oct. 16 Equifax said that anyone having trouble with the service should call 1-888-548-7878 for help.

One reader reported that the new free monitoring service that Equifax is providing to everyone, called TrustedID Premier, wasn’t working for her. She applied for a new credit card and was approved but she never got the alert that she was supposed to receive.

So Much of This Does Not Seem Sensible or Easy. Why?

Why didn’t Equifax make its credit freezes free the moment it announced the breach?

Updated: Oct. 2 The company sent me a response to this question that did not actually answer the question, noting only that it eventually made them free for a few months.

Why not take a leading approach to security and have frozen files be the default for all people?

Updated: Oct. 16 Instead of answering the question, Equifax told me that “consumers can choose to have their credit reports locked or frozen,” which we already knew.

The industry lives in mortal fear of being forced to freeze all files as a default, in part because it makes money from selling access to files, which is harder to do when they are on ice.

But while it seems like a good idea to just flip a switch on everyone’s credit files, imagine the practical ramifications. No matter how much warning the companies provided, millions of people would still be caught unaware and it would delay home purchases, job applications and scores of other things. So I don’t see it happening.

Why not coordinate with Experian and TransUnion so that consumers can get one year of freezes or locks for life at all three companies?

Updated: Oct. 16 Equifax ignored this question for weeks and then sent me an answer, stating that you have to do it separately at all three bureaus, which was, of course, the very premise of the question. Sigh.

TransUnion has a $19.95-per-month monitoring service that let’s you lock your TransUnion and Equifax files. Experian said that because “not all locks are created equal” that it would be hard to create a one-stop locking shop.

Why are people running into technical problems when PINs are supposed to appear on their screens after getting an Equifax freeze?

I’ve received dozens of emails from people who were able to get freezes from the Equifax website but ran into technical problems when their PIN was supposed to appear on their screens. What is going on here?

“Our technology team is aware of some limited situations in which consumers are unable to view their PINs,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We have identified that this is caused by their browser settings. We are working on a fix for this issue.”

(I do not believe the problems to be “limited,” given the volume of my mail, but we’ll see.)

If you request a security freeze online, the PIN shows up on the screen only. The company said it does not currently email the PIN as a follow-up or send it via United States mail.

If you request a security freeze over the phone, Equifax said it will mail you your PIN, so don’t worry if you don’t catch it over the phone when the automated voice reads it quickly without warning or repetition. But I would expect the mailing process to take weeks, not days.

Didn’t get your PIN at all? Equifax said that you can call 1-866-349-5191 to get it, though you’ll have to answer a bunch of identification questions before the phone representatives will give it to you.

I’m having trouble getting Experian to accept my freeze request online or by phone, and they want me to send them a bunch of personal information by mail. Are they doing this on purpose to discourage me from getting a freeze in the first place?

Updated: Oct. 7 This is for your own protection! Or so said Experian, in a statement: “When we are unable to sufficiently match identification online or by telephone, we request additional documentation in order to verify the individual’s identity. We do so as an additional precaution in an effort to protect the consumer.”

Worried about insecure postal mail if Experian asks for, say, a copy of a driver’s license or Social Security card? Experian noted that “often” you can upload documentation at www.experian.com/upload.

The company would not tell me what percentage of people are given the “prove who you are with paper documents” treatment, but I’ve received a few dozen emails about Experian doing this and very few reports of it happening with Equifax or TransUnion.

Was Equifax deliberately throttling back its website to try to keep people from getting freezes?

And has Equifax deliberately programmed its website to fail to authenticate credit freeze applicants and tells them to use paper in the hopes that people will give up and not freeze their credit files at all?

No, the company told me. “We are experiencing a high volume of requests for security freezes, and have been experiencing some technical issues. We are working diligently to resolve those technical issues,” it said.

What’s with Equifax’s efforts to force people into arbitration if they have disputes related to its original offer of assistance?

“We have removed that language from the TrustedID Premier Terms of Use and it will not apply to the free products offered in response to the cybersecurity incident or for claims related to the cybersecurity incident itself,” the company said. “The arbitration language will not apply to any consumer who signed up before the language was removed.”

Will Equifax force people to submit to mandatory arbitration or some other loss of privileges or rights in exchange for the new offer of free credit locks for life?

Another fear is that Equifax will put people on lenders’ mailing lists, leading to no end of spam. The company has not answered these questions so far.

What should people do if they do not have a United States address and want a credit freeze?

Updated: Oct. 12 According to Equifax, you can send the documents listed below by email, fax or postal mail:

• Proof of your most recent address in the United States.

• Proof of your current address outside of the United States.

• A copy of your Social Security number or another document that provides proof of that number.

• A cover letter with a short description of the request.

Send the documents to: psol.legaldocuments@equifax.com

Or postal mail:

Experian said that the first step is to make sure you still have a credit file at all, as some people who have lived abroad for a while do not. Then, you have to provide proof of your last address in the United States and your current address wherever you live now. You can do all of this by phone (1-888-397 3742) or on the company’s website. If neither of those options work, you’ll need to write in by mail at the address below, though you may still be able to provide your proof of identity documents via Experian’s uploading webpage.

Why won’t Equifax have an on-the-record conversation with you?

New: Oct. 12 I wish I knew. At one point, the company invited me to Atlanta for a chat and then yanked the invitation after I’d already booked a plane ticket. The public relations megafirm Edelman is on the scene, but Steve Behm, an Edelman executive in the region, has not returned any of the messages I’ve sent him in the past five weeks.

Do you work for Equifax? Want to help me answer some questions? I’m easy to find and will keep our conversations private.

What Is This About ‘Locking’ Instead of ‘Freezing?’

What are these locking services that Equifax, Experian and TransUnion offer? How are they different from freezes?

Locking has the same effect as freezing, so no new lender or company will be able to check a file whether it’s locked or frozen. But there may be differences in processes, restrictions and fees.

The glass-half-full crowd will note that unlocking your file doesn’t require the random, hard-to-remember PIN that comes with a frozen file.

The glass-half-empty people will note TransUnion’s requirement that you waive legal rights and Experian’s high fees. I explained this in a column on Sept. 27. Equifax’s TrustedID Premier service includes a one-year lock but not a permanent freeze.

Equifax is saying on their breach website that its locking product requires 24-48 hours of notice to lock or unlock a file. You said in a Sept. 27 column that it’s instant. Who’s right?

New: Sept. 29 I’m right and Equifax is wrong, and it’s caused a great deal of confusion as other media have reported what Equifax was saying on its own website. I told the company about the error, but it hasn’t fixed it yet.

Lots of people who have registered for Equifax’s credit lock via its TrustedID Premier service have not received confirmations. Are they ever going to get them?

“Due to the number of consumers who have requested enrollment in the TrustedID Premier product, we are experiencing periodic delays in issuing confirmation emails,” the company said. “We assure you we are working diligently to send confirmation information as quickly as possible, and apologize to the consumers who have not yet received their confirmation emails. We appreciate your patience. We are continuing to make the experience smoother.”

Many people who finally do get the emails click on the activation link and land on a webpage that doesn’t work. Should they just keep trying?

Updated: Oct. 2 “Equifax continues to enhance our website to improve consumer experiences,” the company said. “We are making the navigation easier to understand and eliminating steps in the enrollment process and investing in technology that allows more people to register faster. The company is committed to making the site right and meeting consumer expectations.”

Why is Equifax sending people activation emails with links inside of them?

Updated Oct. 16 The company said that the links and emails have been designed with security in mind, but I have a hard time fully believing that. Every bit of advice we get on security says to never click a link that is inside an email purporting to be from a financial services firm, even if it appears to be from a company that you already do business with. This is in case the email came from a hacker masquerading as a trusted source and the link is going to harvest information from you in some way.

Instead, the safest move is to go to the company’s website by typing its address into a browser and then complete whatever task needs completing. The format of the activation email seems especially tone-deaf given that we’re just barely removed from a giant security breach.

Can I freeze and lock my Equifax account simultaneously?

New: Oct. 12 No.

I took Equifax up on its offer of TrustedID Premier monitoring, which includes locking. I had a freeze in place before I did so. Now I see an icon of an open lock when I log in to TrustedID Premier. Does this mean that my freeze is no longer in effect?

No. Because you cannot freeze and lock at the same time, your freeze stays in effect and the unlocked icon just means that your file is not locked. But it’s still frozen, and the other features of the TrustedID service are still supposed to work.

I signed up for a free Equifax lock for a year through the TrustedID Premier program. Once a year is up, will I automatically be switched into the free-lock-for-life program that begins Jan. 31, 2018?

Updated: Oct. 16 The company said it does not know yet.

You say that the locks will be free for life. Do the contracts specify what happens in case the company is purchased by a private equity firm, sold off for parts and/or renamed?

Updated: Oct. 16 The company would not directly answer this question.

What’s the Best Way to Push Back Against Equifax?

I’d like to punish Equifax by joining a class-action suit. How do I do that?

New: Oct. 12 There is no need to join, according to Stuart Rossman, director of litigation at the National Consumer Law Center. There will be an eventual consolidation of all the federal suits against the company, and any person whose information ended up with the thieves will eventually be eligible for any award. He warns that recoveries tend to be quite small.

I’d like to punish Equifax through the legislative process. How might this happen?

New: Oct. 12 Members of Congress have proposed a variety of solutions, but movement in this industry has historically happened in state legislatures. Contact your state representatives and ask them about legislation that would force the three credit bureaus to provide free credit freezes or locks for life, with free temporary lifts as well.

Will Equifax actively fight legislative action that forces freezes to be free or the default?

“This is a very complicated issue and we expect to engage with regulators and legislators on this topic in the future,” Equifax said.

Moreover, they will probably point to the availability of the credit locks — which Experian charges money for and TransUnion gives away only if you are willing to give up legal rights — as a reason why free freezes are not necessary.

Equifax’s announcement that its locks would be free for life was no doubt an effort to get out in front of this question.

How Else Should I React and Protect Myself?

Why can’t I just get a new Social Security number?

New: Oct. 12 You can try, but the Social Security Administration will allow it only in limited circumstances, including when “a victim of identity theft continues to be disadvantaged by using the original number.” Mere annoyance or existential fear over the Equifax breach probably won’t cut it.

I’m worried about someone using my data to file tax returns in my name and commit refund fraud, which would keep me from getting my legitimate refund. Can I do anything to stop it?

New: Oct. 12 Your best bet is to file your returns early, in order to get ahead of thieves who may try to beat you to it.

Some people are eligible to receive personal identification numbers from the Internal Revenue Service each year, which you’d have to include as you file your taxes in order to get your refund. For now, however, they are available only to people in places with high instances of fraud, like Florida, Georgia and the District of Columbia.

Victims of identity theft are also eligible to get a PIN if they fill out an affidavit, but the I.R.S. doesn’t give them out so easily if your only claim is being a victim of a breach like Equifax’s. It notes that “data breach victims should submit a Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, only if your Social Security number has been compromised and your e-file return was rejected as a duplicate or I.R.S. has informed you that you may be a victim of tax-related identity theft.”

I’m worried about someone using my data to establish a Social Security Administration online account in my name and claiming my benefits. Can I do anything to stop it?

New: Oct. 12 Yes, but first review the aggravating experiences I and some readers had.

If you have a freeze on your credit files, you’ll need to temporarily lift it before setting up your Social Security online account. This is not clear to people using the site, to the great annoyance of the customer service representative I spoke with on the phone after waiting on hold for 45 minutes. (She gets a lot of calls about this issue, she said.)

She also told me that I needed to lift my freeze at Experian in order to set up my account. While a Social Security Administration spokesman said I needed only to lift my freeze at Equifax, I guess I’d go with the customer service representative’s word here.

Want to protect yourself further? You can block online access altogether. This is reversible, but you’ll have to contact the Social Security Administration for help when you’re ready.

How can people protect their children?

Updated: Oct. 16 Lots of people asked about this in a variety of ways:

• Are there mechanisms in place to proactively freeze a child's file (or, if one does not exist, create a file so it can be frozen), and when, if ever, does that depend on where you live?

• What if a child's Social Security number is showing that it “may” have been compromised via the Equifax breach but the Equifax system won't let parents sign up the child for monitoring due to their age or their lack of a credit file?

• Why is it so hard to, upon request, create a blank file for a kid simply to prophylactically freeze it?

• Or better yet, why not freeze all Social Security numbers for people under 18, period?

The nasty problem of child identity theft has been around for a while, and I wrote a column about it in 2015. Equifax’s response to my breach-related questions so far has been illogical. Here was its first pass:

“Equifax typically does not maintain files on minors. It is possible a parent may add an older minor as an authorized user to a credit card. Even if a minor was added as an authorized user to a credit card, Equifax has no indication that its core consumer credit database was impacted by the cybersecurity incident. To confirm, any information reported to Equifax by credit card companies on authorized users would not have been impacted.”

This is nonsense. Many parents have reported putting their children’s Social Security numbers into Equifax’s “Am I Impacted?” site and finding that their child “may” have been. If that’s the case, then parents need answers to their questions. If not, the website isn’t working.

When I pointed this out to the company, it refused to address the question of what happens when you put a minor’s Social Security number into its site. Instead, it just told people to call 1-866-447-7559 with any questions. If you call that number, please let me know what the phone representatives are saying and if they can answer your questions.

In general, here’s how things ought to work: There should be a database of Social Security numbers belonging to minors that effectively shuts down access to those digits until they all turn 18. But why should things be simple?

Instead, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion all have their own baroque processes that parents can use to figure out if a child has a credit file (they’re generally not supposed to) and if so, anything bad has happened to it. Some states let you freeze a child’s file, while others don’t. The National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a state-by-state guide on its website.

What’s a fraud alert, and how does it differ from a credit lock or freeze?

New: Oct. 12 If there’s a fraud alert on your credit report, it means that any lender is supposed to take additional steps to verify your identity (or that of a thief applying for credit in your name). TransUnion has a good explainer on its website of all the different types.

With a freeze or a lock, the new company could not get access to your file at all and would immediately shut down the application as opposed to merely sizing up the person applying.

If I want an extended fraud alert (and not a freeze), can I just take a screenshot of Equifax’s “Am I impacted” webpage that says I’m one of the 145.5 million that may have been impacted to prove that I am a victim?

Equifax has not answered this question so far. Typically, a person needs to submit a police report to receive an extended fraud alert.

Can you have a fraud alert and a freeze at the same time?

Updated: Oct. 12 Yes. I get that this is more or less redundant, but many people don't trust Equifax in particular to follow through, so they want to take a belt-and-suspenders approach to protection.

What was the distinguishing criteria that affected up to 145.5 million people vs. the people who supposedly weren’t affected?

New: Sept. 28 Equifax has not answered this yet.

Don’t I just need a name, address, Social Security number and date of birth to create an online Equifax account, which is the exact information that was stolen?

The presumption is that anyone with your information could set up your account before you get there, but enter their own email address and mobile phone number for confirmation, thus gaining control of the account.

New: Sept. 28 I’m still trying to figure out what Equifax is doing about it.

Is it possible to simply delete my Equifax credit file, so that I don’t have to worry about them setting any more of my data loose on the world?

Updated: Oct. 7 The company refused to answer when I wrote a column about this very question. It seems like the answer is no for now.

How to Dress to Win an Election: The Sebastian Kurz Primer

During his election night rally, supporters wore turquoise jackets, shirts or sunglasses and carried turquoise balloons emblazoned with “Team Kurz.” It wasn’t the only thing he gave a specific look.
Yet Mr. Kurz wears pretty much the same style with impunity, perhaps because, thanks to his age, it seems authentically chosen, as opposed to adopted out of political calculus.
Indeed, Gernot Bauer, the national desk editor at the Austrian newsmagazine Profil, told NPR that Mr. Kurz was like Justin Bieber.
(His critics use “mini-dictator” and even “Baby Hitler.”)All of which underscored the message that Mr. Kurz represented something new.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
According to Sylvia Kritzinger, a professor at the University of Vienna, the People’s Party leader “says almost the same thing the rival Freedom Party was saying — things that would normally be labeled extremism about immigrants not being Austrians — but makes everyone feel comfortable with it.”

That’s not simply because of his age and unthreatening youthful appearance, but because of the depth of his understanding of the power of a brand — an understanding shared by Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Macron. (See the official “behind-the-scenes” video of Mr. Macron arranging various heavily symbolic items on his desk before his official portrait.)

Photo

Mr. Kurz branded not only himself, but also his party. He changed its official color from black to turquoise and referred to it as the New People’s Party, the better to transform it from a familiar part of a coalition government to a “movement” (a word seemingly borrowed from Mr. Macron) shaped in his own image. During his election night rally, supporters wore turquoise jackets, shirts or sunglasses and carried turquoise balloons emblazoned with “Team Kurz.” It wasn’t the only thing he gave a specific look.

“Everything he does is styled to the last breath,” said Eugen Freund, a Social Democratic member of the European Parliament. “Not just on the fashion side. Everything is thought through: every movement of his hands, the way he gazes at people with a slight forward tilt of the head as if to indicate his attention. He does not leave anything to circumstance.”

It began very early. In 2009, not long after Mr. Kurz became leader of the youth wing of the party, he went on an image-ineering campaign, with the tag line “Black is hot,” featuring a picture of himself perched on the bonnet of a Hummer, in jeans, an untucked shirt and a come-hither look, surrounded by some equally satisfied-looking peers. It was broadly mocked, but it was also the beginning of a pattern.

Since becoming foreign minister in 2013 at age 27, Mr. Kurz has become known for his slim-line suits, a tendency to forgo ties (though he does wear them in debates and during state occasions), open collars and slicked-back hair. On his website, Kurz2017, not one of the multiple photographs of him staring soulfully out a window at the future, hard at work and talking to “real” men and women, features a tie. Occasionally he is shown in jeans and a pressed shirt, or a jacket, but never a T-shirt. His casual Friday look is not about a rejection of convention, but rather a noncontroversial loosening up.

“People can connect to it very easily,” Ms. Kritzinger said. “The ties symbolized the idea he was trying to do something different.” Though not, it should be said, different from Mr. Trudeau, who is also often tieless (or before him, President Barack Obama). Rather, it’s different from his older colleagues.

“It’s very unlike what you usually see,” Mr. Freund said, noting that ties have always been de rigueur in political dress in Austria, a country that hews closely to tradition and formality. “It makes a statement. And the collars are very specific: shark collars, never a button-down, the two ends spread wide apart.”

Mr. Kurz also flies economy class, works at a standing desk, likes to tweet (he has 253,000 followers) and, like Mr. Trudeau, will engage in selfies with fans for hours. Also like Mr. Trudeau, sports are a key part of his image: His website has videos of him biking, playing tennis and solo climbing a mountain under the stars, only to arrive at the metal cross on the summit as dawn breaks over the Alpine vista.

Subtle it isn’t.

Pointedly, the selfie thing, as well as the slightly hipster suits, were also hallmarks of his rivals, but none of them got quite the same credit for it. Indeed, the current chancellor, Christian Kern, was occasionally criticized as a “slim-fit chancellor” thanks to his suits. Yet Mr. Kurz wears pretty much the same style with impunity, perhaps because, thanks to his age, it seems authentically chosen, as opposed to adopted out of political calculus.

The truth of that is debatable, but it’s the appearance that counted. Which is the point.

Indeed, Gernot Bauer, the national desk editor at the Austrian newsmagazine Profil, told NPR that Mr. Kurz was like Justin Bieber. On Twitter, a fan compared the new chancellor to James Bond. (His critics use “mini-dictator” and even “Baby Hitler.”)

All of which underscored the message that Mr. Kurz represented something new. That the newness seems to be in fact a swing to the right, and may involve a coalition with the far right populist Freedom Party, has been made palatable by the artful way Mr. Kurz used his image to make the medicine go down.

It’s not the triumph of style over substance; it’s the use of style to convey, or sometimes camouflage, substance. And like it or not, it is increasingly looking like strategy. A spoonful of turquoise, and all that.

For immigrants living far from their homelands, music — even a few notes of a favorite ballad — can summon a lifetime of memories. With each song come remembrances of a lost love, a long-lost relative, or a lazy summer day. Music can also connect children born in the United States to the rhythms and cultures left behind by their parents.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

1. Start With the Monday Puzzles

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

How this works isn’t completely clear. The anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids, which abound in fish oils, may be partly responsible, as well as those acids’ direct effects on the nervous system. But if you prefer not to contribute to the depletion of the world’s fisheries, or simply can’t stand fish, various plant compounds appear to have a similar protective effect.

Pollution can activate normally quiet “bad genes,” Jia Zhong, a Columbia University epidemiologist and the lead author on the study, told me. B vitamins may keep those potentially dangerous genes silent. Yet another study, conducted in Mexico, indicated that vitamins C and E could, when given to asthmatic children, prevent ozone from diminishing lung function.

So should we all load up on supplements? Here, caution is warranted. First, the supplement industry isn’t regulated. Quality control is questionable. But more important, excess supplementation may cause a different kind of harm. A number of studies have shown that people who supplement with certain vitamins, including E and the B’s, have a greater risk of cancer than those who don’t. In one study, voles given vitamins E and C had shorter life spans than their untreated brethren.

There is a deeper lesson here about the dangers of trying to reduce imagined healthy behavior to just a few simple components. Observational studies have long suggested that people who eat lots of fruit, vegetables and whole grains have a lower risk of various chronic and degenerative diseases. So years ago, some researchers proposed that the dietary antioxidants, including vitamins, in these foods could explain these patterns. These antioxidants theoretically protect us from damage by pro-oxidants.

But that explanation may be incorrect. In recent years, a more nuanced idea has emerged. Yes, vitamins are important to our health. But we may actually require some amount of the supposedly dangerous “pro-oxidant” signals to stay healthy. If that signal is completely quashed, we may end up weaker, not stronger.

Thus, in one highly cited German study, people given the antioxidant vitamins C and E after a workout — exercise causes a short-term proliferation of pro-oxidants — failed to grow stronger. By neutralizing the free radicals, the thinking goes, antioxidants canceled the benefits of exercise, preventing strengthening.

Today some people think that many biologically active substances in plant-rich diets aren’t necessarily improving health by acting as antioxidants at all. Instead, these substances seem to activate our own, intrinsic protective mechanisms. It’s this response that makes us more resilient to subsequent insult, and better able to cope. The compound sulforaphane, found in things like broccoli, brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables, is a case in point. Rather than directly neutralizing pro-oxidants, it prompts our bodies to boost defenses and detoxify itself.

In a recent study led by scientists at Johns Hopkins, 148 Chinese residents of a polluted region near the Yangtze River delta drank a broccoli sprout drink for 12 weeks. Excretion of toxic compounds, as measured in urine, went up compared with a group that drank placebo. Sulforaphane wasn’t shielding their bodies directly but rather increasing their own detox capacity and helping them to expel pollutants.

Should we all drink broccoli-sprout juice? The study’s senior author, Thomas Kensler, a professor of pharmacology and chemical biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, doesn’t recommend it. Too much remains unknown, he says. Sulforaphane isn’t the only beneficial plant chemical of this sort out there; plants produce hundreds of such substances. He recommends you “eat a good diet,” which includes lots of raw or lightly cooked cruciferous vegetables, and fruits and vegetables in general.

We can’t be certain it will help with pollution, but it most likely won’t hurt.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Thodoris Nikolaou has spent the last three years — and counting — crisscrossing the Balkan Peninsula to create a visual mosaic of the region’s people and their stories. But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

Photo

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

If you are solving using mostly the Down clues, as I sometimes do, this will be incredibly easy (except, of course, for BISTRE at 47D. Where did that come from? Answer: France), and you might miss a lot of the fun with the Across clues. Don’t do it: Getting through 68 homophone clues is fabulous solving practice and a great brain workout.

What’s most striking about the episode, titled “Mercy,” is how little we see of those walkers. Once the show’s source of existential dread, they’re now mostly props, staggering past in the background or being herded like deadly farm animals. A column of them figures in the plot in a way that’s derivative of Season 6’s quarry episodes while lacking any real sense of freaky menace.

A long shift from walkers to humans as primary antagonists now feels complete, though of course the show could shift back at any time. The band of survivors centered on the former deputy sheriff Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) has faced human nemeses all along, from the loose cannon Merle Dixon to the maniacal Governor, but the definitive turn happened with the introduction of the current nemesis, the theatrical, truly comic book-style Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whose performance has been the main reason to watch lately).

The urge to expand the story beyond the constant flight from mindless flesh-munchers is understandable. But much of the dread, as well as emotional urgency, has gone out of the show in the process. What we’re left with, in the current plot in which Rick tries to unite various survivor groups against Negan’s predatory Saviors, are platitudes about community building and the ethics of self-preservation, swathed in the show’s always evocative cinematography and high production values.

(Though even here there’s room to carp: the staging of the action in the season premiere, in which Rick, Maggie and XXX lead an attack on the Saviors compound, feels well below the show’s previous standard, like Michael Bay on a bad day. And with all those bullets flying around, how is it possible that no one has just gone ahead and shot Negan?)

“The Walking Dead,” with its two-part, 16-episode seasons, is in a no-man’s-land between shorter cable and streaming shows and longer but episodic broadcast shows, and it’s TV’s prime example of the strains of telling a tightly serialized story across many years with no natural end in sight.

What made the show terrifying in its early seasons wasn’t its gore, but the seemingly certain extinction faced weekly by its small, thrown together band of wanderers. You can defend what’s happened since as a natural, even realistic, progression, but the political-philosophical-religious allegory the show’s become is a wan replacement for the nail-biting survival tale that it was.

The season premiere contains what could be a nod to a possible end game for the show: a few short, fragmentary scenes in which an older, biblically bearded Rick is still alive. It’s unclear whether they’re actual flash forwards or some kind of vision or dream. But if they are the future, the realities of balance sheets and franchise building mean that there will be a lot of circling around before it arrives.

Founded in 1967, the Bard Hall Players produces three shows a year: a classic play in the winter, a contemporary drama in the spring, and a musical in the fall. Every production is put together by the students — from the sets and costumes to the orchestra and lighting.

“It’s what sold me on Columbia — how could I go anywhere else?” said Kyle Lindsey McCormick, a second-year medical student and one of the group’s co-presidents.

Incorporating the arts into medical school curriculums is an increasingly popular trend. The arts and humanities initiative at Harvard Medical School includes a collaboration with American Repertory Theater. Yale School of Medicine requires a course in which students observe paintings. But an extracurricular student-run theater company that produces a regular season is an anomaly.

“It enhances empathy and understanding and emotional intelligence of our students, and it translates into enhanced understanding for patients from other backgrounds and cultures,” said Dr. Lisa Mellman, the senior associate dean of student affairs at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.

Auditions are open to anyone on the medical campus, including nursing, dental and doctoral students, and everyone who wants to be involved earns a role, onstage or off. Dr. Donald O. Quest, a neurosurgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian, has played trombone in the orchestra pit for several shows, and Dr. Mellman has made cameos in some productions.

Dr. Jay H. Lefkowitch joined the Bard Hall Players in 1972, performing minor roles in musicals like “Anything Goes” and focusing on set design, employing his undergraduate degree in art. Now a pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian, he is the faculty adviser of the group and an impassioned supporter of the arts, speaking as knowledgeably about post-Sondheim musical theater as he does about intestinal cancers.

Bard Hall Players isn’t the only artistic group at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The school has an a cappella group called The Ultrasounds. Each class has a band (The second year’s is called the Flu Fighters). There’s also a symphony, composed of students and staff.

Many students believe their artistic credentials helped them get into the school. Jenna Lanz, a second-year medical student and co-president of the Players, said Columbia was barely on her radar screen when she was applying to medical schools, because it was a stretch academically. But during her interview, she said, she talked about her theater experience and its connection to medicine.

“When you have the ability to see other people’s lives and put yourself into them, then it helps you serve them better and understand what they’re going through in a different way,” she said.

Bard Hall Players includes students have never acted before and those who have worked in the theater professionally. Ms. Boyle was an assistant stage manager at the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey. Ms. McCormick, who plays Cinderella, studied music and opera at Columbia as an undergraduate. James Lasky, who plays Cinderella’s Prince, is a former ballet dancer and model. Cory Chang, one of the production’s music directors, earned a master’s degree in collaborative piano from Eastman School of Music.

And some have had full-fledged careers in the arts. Dr. Michael Parker Ayers, who graduated in 2014 and is now a cardiology fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, acted professionally before attending Columbia. A few weeks after starting medical school in 2010, he received a call from the casting director for “West Side Story” on Broadway, asking if he was available to be the new standby for Tony. He ended up turning down the offer and joining the Players instead.

“When you’re a professional actor, your age and your look have to align with the character’s type,” said Dr. Ayers, noting that he enjoyed the chance to play roles like Pseudolus, the Roman slave, in the Bard Hall Players’ production of “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.”

“That’s a Nathan Lane type, and I’m 6 feet 2 inches and blond,” he said. “I got to do something that I would never have gotten to do in the professional theater world.”

Students often apply their medical training to their character development. When Ms. Boyle directed “Julius Caesar” her first year, she and the cast spoke often about how Caesar has epilepsy, “the falling sickness,” and how his confusion could be a result of a postictal state, the time following a seizure.

To prepare for “Into the Woods,” Kelseanne Breder, a PhD. nursing student specializing in psychology who plays the Witch decided that vertical trauma, the idea that suffering is carried across generations, is relevant to her character’s back story. The Witch’s mother left her when she was young and now she’s projecting by keeping her daughter Rapunzel in captivity.

The fourth-year medical student Nicole Curatola, who plays Jack’s Mother in “Into the Woods,” said theater has helped broaden her perspective on the medical profession.

“You get time to dive into the human experience,” Ms. Curatola said. “What do these characters represent? What do they go through? And a lot of times, you need to put yourself in the shoes of patients. It keeps you grounded in the human experience.”

Most of all, the students see the club as a way to relieve stress. At a recent evening rehearsal, the cast, dressed in a mix of street clothes and scrubs, stumbled through the choreography to the Act I finale, linking arms and skipping with abandon across the stage.

“Do you have an acronym for remembering these lyrics?” one of the performers asked, as if academic memorization methods could be applied to the musical.

In the end, it didn’t matter. People forgot the lyrics. People forgot the steps. But everyone was laughing. That’s the reason, according to Dr. Lefkowitch, the club has endured for 50 years. “It’s a source of sanity,” he said.

Empowering Girls Rescued From Child Marriage

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.
“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.

Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Photo

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

Photo

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Tarantino on Weinstein: ‘I Knew Enough to Do More Than I Did’

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said.
Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology.
Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.
But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply.
Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he recalled, saying he wrote them off as mild misbehavior. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

In the hourlong conversation, Mr. Tarantino, 54, apologized for not doing more while also explaining why; admitted his own culpability while also calling for sweeping change in Hollywood’s treatment of women; and condemned Mr. Weinstein, 65, while acknowledging their father-son closeness.

The producer and director have been symbiotic for decades: from 1992, when Mr. Weinstein distributed “Reservoir Dogs,” through “Pulp Fiction,” the “Kill Bill” films, “Inglourious Basterds” and “The Hateful Eight,” until a few weeks ago, when he threw Mr. Tarantino an engagement party.

When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said. But some of the accounts were deeply familiar to him. “Everyone who was close to Harvey had heard of at least one of those incidents” chronicled in the first few articles, he said. “It was impossible they didn’t.”

The Weinstein Investigation

When he and Ms. Sorvino started dating in 1995, she told him that not long before, Mr. Weinstein had massaged her without asking, chased her around a hotel room and even showed up at her apartment in the middle of the night, a story she recently shared with The New Yorker.

“I was shocked and appalled” back then, Mr. Tarantino said. “I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira.” She had won accolades for her performance in “Mighty Aphrodite,” and “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way,” Mr. Tarantino said. “Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

The problem was resolved, he said he felt at the time, because he and Ms. Sorvino were dating. “I’m with her, he knows that, he won’t mess with her, he knows that she’s my girlfriend,” Mr. Tarantino said, describing his attitude back then.

Over the years, he learned of other accounts. Another actress friend told him a troubling story of unwanted advances by Mr. Weinstein in a hotel room. Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology. (She confirmed the account to The Times but declined to be identified.)

Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. Recently, she tweeted that Mr. Weinstein had raped her.

Mr. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex made by Ms. McGowan and others.

There were rumors too, shadowy accounts that Mr. Tarantino continued to hear second- or thirdhand and never pursued further. Now Mr. Tarantino said he regretted not taking the women’s stories seriously enough. “I chalked it up to a ’50s-’60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s O.K. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

In the interview, Mr. Tarantino issued several calls to action. In its treatment of women, Hollywood has been “operating under an almost Jim Crow-like system that us males have almost tolerated,” he said. “We allowed it to exist because that’s the way it was.”

On the discussion of who knew what about Mr. Weinstein and when, he said: “I’m calling on the other guys who knew more to not be scared. Don’t just give out statements. Acknowledge that there was something rotten in Denmark. Vow to do better by our sisters.”

He added, “What was previously accepted is now untenable to anyone of a certain consciousness.”

His own relationship with Mr. Weinstein, who has been fired from his own company and ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, spanned deals and shoots, publicity tours and film festivals. But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply. Mr. Weinstein needs to “face the music,” he said.

Despite their closeness, he said he could offer no insight into Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misdeeds. “I don’t have an answer for why he could do this and be stripped of his entire legacy,” he said.

Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused. “I don’t know,” he said. “I hope it doesn’t.”

Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.
They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry.
They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.
It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces.
Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.

9 Ways to Help You Become a Smarter Investor Image Credit Zach Meyer

Figuring out what is going on in financial markets isn’t easy, even for professionals who trade constantly. In fact, for many people, forgetting about day-to-day market swings and taking a long-term perspective may be the best approach.

Yet anyone saving for retirement or a house, a car or an education — or trying to amass a nest egg for any reason at all — needs to periodically check in to see where the financial world is heading.

The last several months have been particularly puzzling. Markets have continued to rise, despite geopolitical turmoil that might have set them back. To help you understand what’s happening and what to do, w e’ve pulled together some of the biggest issues in investing in a quarterly report.

Among the nine articles are analyses and explanations that provide an easy-to-understand introduction to investing (and perhaps amuse you along the way).

The Stock Market Charges Ahead, Despite the World’s Storms

Wall Street has responded to political turmoil and natural disasters with barely a shrug. The markets have been charging ahead, not just in the past several months but over the past eight years. Stock prices have risen and there are far fewer — if any — bargains, compared with the days right after the end of the financial crisis in 2009.

All of which raises a big question: What are the prospects for a continuing bull market — or a major decline?

Focused Bets on Growth Propel Three Stock Funds

Many funds try simply to match the performance of the stock market. But three funds did better than that by taking a narrow approach.

They crimped the number of their holdings and made concentrated investments in hopes of increasing their total returns. It worked for them in the third quarter.

These Funds Can Put Your Investments on a Low-Carbon Diet

If climate change is on your mind and you want to do good while doing well, you might want to consider low-carbon mutual and exchange-traded funds.

These funds shun fossil-fuel producers, like companies that drill for oil and mine coal, as well as those that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. A new online tool is available that can help you choose among an array of offerings.

As Investors Turn to Bonds From Emerging Markets Like Brazil or India, How High Is the Risk?

With low interest rates in the United States and Europe, it has been tough to generate substantial income from bonds. There has been a big exception, though: bonds issued in emerging market countries.

Many of these fixed-income instruments have excelled in recent months, and managers of funds that specialize in them say such bonds continue to be attractive. But investing in them entails some complicated risks.

An Old-School Investment Manager That Builds Wealth Quietly

Because of their low cost and market-matching abilities, index funds have been growing rapidly in popularity. But there is a case to be made for old-fashioned, disciplined stock picking, especially when it is done at minimal expense.

One of the most successful old school stock picking outfits is Dodge & Cox, which does not advertise or promote its funds. It has a solid performance record and charges some of the lowest fees in the industry.

The High Cost of Not Talking About Money

Money won’t buy happiness, but it can help. This is no mystery. Acquiring, accumulating and spending money often seem to be universal preoccupations in the modern world.

Yet despite the evident importance of money, conversations about it can be very uncomfortable on a personal level. Is an inability to talk openly and honestly about money and investments hurting you in the wallet? A new book argues that it is.

How Funds Manage Boatloads of Money

When funds attract heaps of fresh money, it can be a great thing for investors. A surge in new assets can create economies of scale that are passed along to shareholders, reducing costs and improving performance.

But that virtuous cycle doesn’t always happen. It is worth examining whether sudden inflows of cash have led to poor decisions by fund managers, hurting investor returns.

Where Do All the Disgraced C.E.O.s Go?

Richard F. Smith left Equifax in September after the company came under fire for a cybersecurity breach that compromised the personal information of potentially millions of consumers. Mike Cagney left Social Finance, the student loan company he had co-founded, after reports of allegations of sexual harassment and the company’s “frat house” culture. And then there is the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein , who was fired by his own company after years of allegations of sexual harassment and payoffs to accusers.

Chief executives seem to be stepping down from their posts — voluntarily or not — every day. Where do they go after they leave a scandal-ridden company? Here are some whimsical thoughts on a suitable destination for the besmirched.

Investing by Betting on the Sponsors of Sports

Invest in what you know: That’s an old mantra, and it makes a lot of sense. But what if what you know is, basically, sports?

If you’re not a billionaire and can’t buy teams or leagues outright, it will be difficult to invest in them directly: Most teams and leagues aren’t publicly traded.

So a sportscaster and a financial planner have started a new fund that enables avid fans to place indirect bets. This exchange-traded fund tracks companies that sponsor sports teams or broadcasters. The fund may be a comforting place for sports lovers to place their money, but buyer beware. It is largely untested.

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Backed by American-led coalition airstrikes, Iraq government forces celebrated their recapture of the city in July.

Similar scenes played out in Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city.

Backed by American-led coalition airstrikes, Iraq government forces celebrated their recapture of the city in July. But Mosul’s recovery is a tale of two cities.

In the eastern portion, somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of the population that fled during initial fighting over the city have already returned to their homes. But nine months of fighting in the west of Mosul, where militants holed up during their final stand, left the area virtually uninhabitable.

From medical centers to centuries-old mosques, major structures were reduced to rubble and whole neighborhoods wiped off the map. Some fell at the hands of militants who demolished infrastructure as the Iraqi military moved in, including the iconic Al Nuri mosque and its leaning minaret, and some were casualties of coalition airstrikes. Before the Islamic State captured the city, Mosul was home to 1.1 million people. United Nations officials estimate that just restoring basic services there could cost more than $1 billion.

Leila Jane Nassif, the United Nations refugee agency’s assistant representative in Iraq, said the damage in the western part of the city had left hundreds of thousands of people displaced. It is unclear when they will be able to return.

“It will take time for the infrastructure to be in place and for people to be able to rebuild their lives there with so much housing that has been damaged,” Ms. Nassif said in a telephone interview.

Bipartisan Health Proposal Is Too Late for 2018, but a Salve for 2019

It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacare’s rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments. The draft bill would make the application process for such “state innovation waivers” easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with “comparable affordability” to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.

It would allow more Americans to sign up for very high-deductible insurance plans known as catastrophic insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The current law limits those plans to customers under 30 years old, or those who have demonstrated they cannot afford other insurance options.

The draft legislation would also ensure that the federal government assigns money for advertising about the Obamacare enrollment period and for hiring professionals to help customers select and sign up for plans; the money would be a portion of the fees it collects from insurers selling plans on HealthCare.gov. The Trump administration had slashed the budget for both programs in August.

It does not include one of the industry’s biggest requests: funding that would protect insurers from high costs associated with very expensive patients. Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums. But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves. Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.

The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, America’s Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill. But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market. “We’ve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable,” said Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, a large for-profit insurer that offers Blue Cross plans in several states, although he praised lawmakers’ efforts to provide more certainty in 2019.

The deal’s prospects in Congress remain uncertain. Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it. In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.”

But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next year’s health plans. Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored. (The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)

“For 2018, it probably won’t happen in time,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely. “The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and it’s very important for 2019.”

Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier. This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trump’s threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason. Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.

But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bill’s two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isn’t passed far in advance. Many insurers had been hoping that the Alexander-Murray legislation would make the funding permanent.

While Mr. Trump has insisted he will not support any legislation that he believes to be a bailout to the insurers, policy experts say the insurers are getting only what they are due under the law. Because the insurers set the prices for their 2017 plans assuming they would receive the federal funding, the president’s decision represents more than $1 billion in lost payments, according to a recent analysis from Avalere Health, a consulting firm.

The funding has not contributed to outsize profits for the insurers selling individual policies under the law, in spite of Mr. Trump’s recent tweet about the insurers “who have made a fortune w/ O’Care.” “Most insurance companies have lost money trying to pursue these exchange markets,” said Dan Mendelson, Avalere’s president. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are not allowed to pocket more than 20 percent of their premium dollars for overhead and profits. If they earn more, they are required to return the excess to consumers through rebates.

The insurers generally lost money in the first three years of the Obamacare market, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst for Standard & Poor’s, though it appears they were faring better this year, before the cancellation of government payments. “It is not a market that has been profitable for them,” he said. While there are exceptions, most insurers are making their money in other insurance markets like the government programs Medicare and Medicaid as well as in the much larger employer market.

“It gives the market some measure of predictability,” Mr. Banerjee said, but he emphasized that the legislation “is not a permanent solution.” Much of what it does is restore the funding that already existed before President Trump’s announcement that he was cutting it off. “It’s not a huge additional support for the market.”

In defending Mr. Trump on Wednesday against claims by some plaintiffs that it was impossible to compete for business against the most powerful man in the world, a Justice Department lawyer played down his pull. “The president is a market participant,” said Brett Shumate, a deputy assistant attorney general. “He is not controlling access to the market.” But his participation in the market is part of the problem: Americans shouldn’t have to worry that their leader’s primary allegiance is to his own financial fortunes.

Mr. Trump gives little reason to feel reassured. In 2015, he said of Saudi Arabia: “I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me.” He added: “They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?” (On his first overseas trip after taking office, to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump lavished praise on the kingdom’s rulers, dismissing concerns about their repressive policies.)

Meanwhile, foreign officials are racing to curry favor with our businessman in chief. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, one diplomat told The Washington Post, “Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel, blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ ”

The case being heard Wednesday was filed days after Mr. Trump took office by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a bipartisan watchdog group. CREW’s complaint highlights the conflicts between Mr. Trump’s duties as president and his “vast, complicated and secret” web of business interests. These include Trump Tower in New York, where foreign-government-held entities like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China hold leases that will come up for renewal during Mr. Trump’s term, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where foreign diplomats pay top dollar to sleep, eat and do business with the United States. (Elected federal officials, including the president, are prohibited from holding the lease to the hotel, but that’s another story.)

Since the emoluments suit was filed, plaintiffs who complained of unfair competition in the hospitality industry have joined in. Meanwhile, two separate federal suits have also charged Mr. Trump with violating the emoluments clauses — one by nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress and the other by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.

A central question for the courts is the meaning of “emoluments.” Does the term cover only those benefits given in exchange for an official’s “personal services,” as the White House contends? Or does it apply to “anything of value” an official receives, as the plaintiffs argue? At Wednesday’s hearing, Judge George Daniels of Federal District Court appeared sympathetic to a broader reading, but was skeptical that the plaintiffs have standing to bring the lawsuit, because they had not shown concrete ways that Mr. Trump’s actions had directly harmed them.

Even if the case is thrown out on those grounds, Mr. Trump is still a walking emoluments-clause violation. And he still refuses to release his tax returns and other financial records, preventing the public from seeing the full extent of his business entanglements, debts and interests.

In this light it’s hard to see how the American people can ever be confident that Mr. Trump, who has spent a lifetime as a money-obsessed deal maker, is acting in the nation’s best interest, and not his own.

Unearthing a Massacre in Peru

Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Daniel Castro Garcia has been awarded the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

Photo

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

中国女性史诗小说《喜福会》的作者谭恩美(Amy Tan)在近期出版的回忆录中提到了她的祖母，一位死于可能是故意吸食鸦片过量的“concubine”。这个词通常被翻译为“妾”。在韦氏词典里，它的含义是：

A woman with whom a man cohabits without being married: such as

a：one having a recognized social status in a household below that of a wife

b：a mistress

一个与一名男性同居，但非对方妻子的女人：比如

a：一个家庭里社会地位被认为低于妻子的女人。

b：一个情妇

妾是一个男人的性伴侣，被期望为他生儿育女，却得不到妻子一般的地位认可和继承权。

Regulator Blasts Wells Fargo for Deceptive Auto Insurance Program
-Keywords-
['deceptive', 'insurance', 'program', 'complaints', 'wells', 'report', 'fargos', 'blasts', 'office', 'bank', 'regulator', 'comptrollers', 'auto', 'fargo']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Last year, the comptroller’s office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo.
For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo’s oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance.
Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.
Wells Fargo’s auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said.
Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
That internal report said the costs of the unneeded insurance, which covered collision damage, had caused some 274,000 Wells Fargo customers to fall behind on their car loans, and almost 25,000 vehicles were wrongly repossessed. Customers on active military duty were among those hurt by the practice.

In the comptroller’s report, regulators said management at the bank’s auto loan unit, Wells Fargo Dealer Services, had ignored signs of problems in the business such as consumer complaints, focusing instead on sales volume and performance. The report described its management of compliance risk — essentially the ability to abide by regulations and best practices — as “weak.” It noted that Wells Fargo in 2015 had characterized the risks associated with this business as “low.”

Wells Fargo has set aside $80 million to compensate the 570,000 customers it said were harmed by receiving auto insurance they didn’t want. The comptroller’s office said that the amount was inadequate and that the bank might have to pay out substantially more as additional victims were identified — partly because Wells Fargo’s analysis of how much money it needed to set aside excluded many years when the insurance was being imposed.

The report does give Wells Fargo’s management credit for taking action after identifying the problems at the auto loan unit, such as hiring legal and consulting firms to assess customer harm, changing staff at the operation and notifying regulators.

The comptroller’s findings are likely to affect how Wells Fargo does business, not just in the auto lending operation but across the bank. The comptroller’s office said it would require Wells Fargo to ensure that all of its business units had effective systems in place to identify and prevent risky practices.

Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement that the bank had made significant changes in recent months to strengthen controls and oversight of insurers and outside vendors with which it does business.

“We are also working to enhance our customer care program and improve complaints resolution,” she said. “We will continue to work with regulators on the remediation and make improvements to our auto lending business to build a better Wells Fargo.”

Wells Fargo stopped the auto insurance program in September 2016.

Once the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency makes its findings formal, Wells Fargo will have time to correct the problems. A spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office declined to comment on the report.

The report did not mention penalties or fines. The comptroller can impose penalties for violations of laws or unsound business practices in an attempt to deter violations and encourage corrective measures.

Last year, the comptroller’s office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo. A report in April by the office’s ombudsman concluded that the agency “must continue our efforts to improve and refine the agency’s supervisory program, to sharpen our early warning processes, and to enhance our supervisory capabilities.”

The comptroller’s review of Wells Fargo’s auto lending and insurance practices has been underway for several months.

The report paints a damning picture of a bank that didn’t monitor its contractors, that lacked the impetus to correct problems once they were uncovered and that proved unresponsive to complaints from its customers.

For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo’s oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance. National General was not obligated to — and did not — alert Wells Fargo to customer complaints about the unneeded insurance, the report said.

And when auditors at Wells Fargo detected and then flagged problems with National General in 2015, the comptroller’s office said, the bank didn’t act on those concerns promptly.

Christine Worley, a spokeswoman for National General, disputed elements of the report. “We believe that our customer service in this area was handled in a timely manner,” she said in a statement. “We work closely with our financial institution clients and advise them of complaints on a regular basis.”

The bank’s lapses in handling consumer complaints and managing vendors are not new. Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.

Wells Fargo’s ability to track consumer complaints efficiently, for example, had been part of a 2015 compliance-improvement plan at the bank, the report noted. And a so-called consent order in 2011 between Wells Fargo and the comptroller’s office involving the bank’s mortgage foreclosure operations required it to establish a more effective program to manage its relationships with outside companies and contractors.

The comptroller’s office also concluded that the bank’s plan to compensate customers who were harmed by the improprieties was insufficient. When calculating potential damages, the bank limited its payments to customers who were affected beginning in January 2012 and extending to July this year. But the auto insurance program has been in place for almost 12 years, and the bank didn’t calculate potential damages caused for much of that period.

“The number of customers harmed in this time period could be substantial,” the report said.

Wells Fargo also used “an overly complicated reimbursement methodology which lacked clear support for addressing all the customer costs incurred,” according to the report.

Wells Fargo’s auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said. For example, the bank did not break out the insurance costs embedded in car loans; rather, it included the amounts owed on the unneeded coverage in the monthly payments. Had borrowers known what the cost increases were for, the comptroller’s office said, they could have taken action more quickly to avoid harm.

Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges. The comptroller office’s review of loan files and consumer complaints showed that Wells Fargo’s customers often had to submit proof of coverage multiple times before the coverage was canceled.

Rich Lowry in National Review:

“It might be the stupidest and most unworthy controversy of the year, and that’s saying something.”

According to Mr. Lowry, the uproar on both sides of the aisle over this issue is misguided. Mr. Trump may have been right that President Obama didn’t call each family of a fallen soldier, but he was nonetheless wrong to “use that point as a bludgeon.” Mr. Lowry adds that while the president’s reported comments to the family of Sergeant. Johnson sounded “horrible in isolation,” there’s no way to properly judge without hearing the entire phone call in context. Moreover, Mr. Lowry believes that controversies over condolence calls should be entirely left “out of our poisonous political debate.” Read more »

From the Left

Brandon Friedman in The New York Daily News:



“There’s often a misconception among non-veterans that service members sign up with the expectation that they may die. But I can tell you: I did two tours in combat as an infantry officer and I never met a soldier who thought dying was a reasonable result of his or her service.”

If the president did indeed tell Sergeant Johnson’s widow that her husband “knew what he was signing up for” in his call, then, according to Mr. Friedman, he has a poor grasp on how the military actually works. Mr. Friedman, who served two tours of duty and worked in the Obama administration, explains that since the Sept. 11 attacks one out of every 5,000 service members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan died on duty. “This makes it clear that dying in combat is neither common nor expected,” he argues. What “keeps troops going,” he explains, is the faith that your government, and your commander in chief, believe that soldiers’ lives are valuable. “No one shrugs death off as an inevitability.” Read more »



_____

Ameer Hasan Loggins in The Guardian:

“I fully empathize with the family of Sergeant La David Johnson. [...] Sadly, the lack of respect given to them is not an American aberration. It is a part of this country’s ugly history regarding black people and the military.”

When Mr. Loggins heard reports of what Mr. Trump had said to Sergeant Johnson’s family, he recognized it as the latest in a long string of moments black veterans were shown disrespect. Mr. Loggins points out that black troops have disproportionally experienced military punishment — up to, and including, the death penalty. Read more »

Margaret Hartmann in New York Magazine:

“The ongoing dispute over Trump’s treatment of Gold Star families runs the risk of overshadowing a more significant concern: More than two weeks after the attack, we don’t really know what happened in Niger.”

Ms. Hartmann notes that in all the attention paid to the condolence call controversy, most outlets and readers have missed a much more important story: the uncertain events from an attack in Niger that left four soldiers — including Sergeant Johnson — dead. In this piece, she outlines what is known and what questions still remain. Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Leonid Bershidsky in Bloomberg:

“The U.S. demands even more ceremony of its presidents than other countries in part because of the expectation that the head of state is also the moral-authority-in-chief where Christian leadership is prized and the president is expected to channel those attitudes.”

Mr. Bershidsky takes a broader view in his column by examining the symbolic, or ceremonial, function of a U.S. president and how President Trump may or may not fulfill this role. He explains how in other countries, ceremonial duties such as honoring soldiers who have died falls to a monarch or other governmental figurehead. In the U.S., he notes, policy and ceremony fall to the same person, for better or for worse. Read more »

Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism
-Keywords-

-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
“What was the mark?” the Facebook user Ariel Macklin wrote in a comment that was liked more than 1,100 times.
Intel, July 2007A 2007 ad for Intel’s new processor showed a white man surrounded by six black sprinters bent over in starting poses.
Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.
“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.
Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
She added that Dove had removed the post and was “re-evaluating our internal processes for creating and reviewing content.” She declined to say how many people reviewed the ad or whether any of them were African-American.

Critics were unimpressed by the company’s apology.

“What was the mark?” the Facebook user Ariel Macklin wrote in a comment that was liked more than 1,100 times. “I mean anyone with eyes can see how offensive this is. Not one person on your staff objected to this? Wow. Will not be buying your products anymore.”

Dove’s ad was not an isolated case by one company, but the latest in a long line of tone-deaf ads by many companies.

Here are a few examples from the past.

Intel, July 2007

A 2007 ad for Intel’s new processor showed a white man surrounded by six black sprinters bent over in starting poses. “Multiply computing performance and maximize the power of your employees,” the text read.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”

Isaiah sets out to discover how and why Marcus died — and Ide quickly turns the tables on his readers. What if Marcus wasn’t the hero his kid brother imagined? What if he led a dirtier life than Isaiah thought possible? In the prologue to “Righteous,” Isaiah discovers that the accident was no accident: Marcus was deliberately targeted. Whoever drove that car sat in it with a sandwich, waiting for Marcus to try to cross the street so he could make the kill.

As anyone who read “IQ” will know, Ide isn’t a one-plot type of writer. He sets many schemes in motion. In the new novel, they involve gambling, a natty Rwandan Hutu gangster who lost one leg to the Tutsi, Chinese triads, money-laundering, human trafficking and a whole lot more. Ide writes about the hostility among ethnic groups — notably black gangs and Chinese triads (whose members’ affectation of American gang habits comes in for some mockery, though their toughness does not) — in ways that would be offensive if they weren’t equal-opportunity insults. The world of these books is one of constant trash talk, and Ide delivers it with style.

None of it comes from Isaiah. He remains the one stand-up guy in the midst of hot- and cold-running human detritus. But eight years have changed him. He’s no longer the boy wonder we first met. He’s a grown man with no concrete future plans who solves neighborhood crimes mostly as favors — until he suddenly discovers motivation. (Dodson is now a family man, settled down with a woman who can talk back to him and a “Lil’ Tupac” expected any day.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The galvanizing force is Sarita, Marcus’s girlfriend. When Isaiah crosses paths with her again, he starts imagining an adult life with wine, an actual sofa and the woman of his dreams.

Will Ide lead Isaiah toward happiness? The book’s battles play out ingeniously, with Isaiah trying to figure out how he could have been so wrong about Marcus. He is also hired by a seemingly reputable Chinese father to rescue a daughter who has severe gambling problems. A lot of characters crop up in “Righteous”; one reason is that the trail Marcus left was a complicated one, but another is that Ide can’t seem to resist a good subplot when he thinks of one. A third possibility may be that this series plans to move on. Like “IQ,” the new book has an ending that will make you hope for the arrival of another installment, pronto.

“Righteous” takes its title from a quality that Marcus was thought to represent and that Isaiah still embodies. It seems possible, by the novel’s end, that Isaiah has done what he can in East Long Beach and is ready to take on the wider world. It also seems possible that Isaiah may stop working for peanuts — or in one case, “live chickens and blueberry muffins.” And it may be time for Ide to lay to rest Isaiah’s Marcus obsession and give him other things to think about. I can’t wait to find out what they’ll be.

The woman, now 38, said the assault took place in February 2013, after Mr. Weinstein approached her in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel, where she was staying, and asked her to invite him to her room. After she refused and went upstairs, Mr. Weinstein appeared at her door anyway and entered the room.

Here’s looking at you, pup.

The wide-eyed, pleading look of your dog may melt your heart and cause food to vanish from the table, but that doesn’t really mean your pet has become the master of manipulation.

Sometimes a dog’s expression merely reflects yours.

In a new study, researchers in Britain monitored dogs’ facial expressions — particularly the muscle that raises the inner part of the eyebrows and makes their eyes look bigger — while a person was either paying attention to them or turned away, sometimes holding food and sometimes not.

The dogs were much more expressive when the person was paying attention, but food didn’t seem to make a difference, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The dogs also stuck out their tongues and barked more when they got attention, compared with when they were being ignored or given food.

“This simply shows that dogs produce more (but not different) facial movements when someone is looking at them,” Juliane Kaminski, the study’s lead researcher and a senior lecturer at the University of Portsmouth in England, said via email.

This should be good news for any dog lover who fears that Fido only cares because he’s being fed, said Brian Hare, a professor and director of the canine cognition center at Duke University who was not involved in the study.

Mr. Trump gives little reason to feel reassured.
Am I supposed to dislike them?” (On his first overseas trip after taking office, to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump lavished praise on the kingdom’s rulers, dismissing concerns about their repressive policies.)
CREW’s complaint highlights the conflicts between Mr. Trump’s duties as president and his “vast, complicated and secret” web of business interests.
Even if the case is thrown out on those grounds, Mr. Trump is still a walking emoluments-clause violation.
In this light it’s hard to see how the American people can ever be confident that Mr. Trump, who has spent a lifetime as a money-obsessed deal maker, is acting in the nation’s best interest, and not his own.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
In defending Mr. Trump on Wednesday against claims by some plaintiffs that it was impossible to compete for business against the most powerful man in the world, a Justice Department lawyer played down his pull. “The president is a market participant,” said Brett Shumate, a deputy assistant attorney general. “He is not controlling access to the market.” But his participation in the market is part of the problem: Americans shouldn’t have to worry that their leader’s primary allegiance is to his own financial fortunes.

Mr. Trump gives little reason to feel reassured. In 2015, he said of Saudi Arabia: “I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me.” He added: “They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?” (On his first overseas trip after taking office, to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump lavished praise on the kingdom’s rulers, dismissing concerns about their repressive policies.)

Meanwhile, foreign officials are racing to curry favor with our businessman in chief. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, one diplomat told The Washington Post, “Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel, blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ ”

The case being heard Wednesday was filed days after Mr. Trump took office by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a bipartisan watchdog group. CREW’s complaint highlights the conflicts between Mr. Trump’s duties as president and his “vast, complicated and secret” web of business interests. These include Trump Tower in New York, where foreign-government-held entities like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China hold leases that will come up for renewal during Mr. Trump’s term, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where foreign diplomats pay top dollar to sleep, eat and do business with the United States. (Elected federal officials, including the president, are prohibited from holding the lease to the hotel, but that’s another story.)

Since the emoluments suit was filed, plaintiffs who complained of unfair competition in the hospitality industry have joined in. Meanwhile, two separate federal suits have also charged Mr. Trump with violating the emoluments clauses — one by nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress and the other by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.

A central question for the courts is the meaning of “emoluments.” Does the term cover only those benefits given in exchange for an official’s “personal services,” as the White House contends? Or does it apply to “anything of value” an official receives, as the plaintiffs argue? At Wednesday’s hearing, Judge George Daniels of Federal District Court appeared sympathetic to a broader reading, but was skeptical that the plaintiffs have standing to bring the lawsuit, because they had not shown concrete ways that Mr. Trump’s actions had directly harmed them.

Even if the case is thrown out on those grounds, Mr. Trump is still a walking emoluments-clause violation. And he still refuses to release his tax returns and other financial records, preventing the public from seeing the full extent of his business entanglements, debts and interests.

In this light it’s hard to see how the American people can ever be confident that Mr. Trump, who has spent a lifetime as a money-obsessed deal maker, is acting in the nation’s best interest, and not his own.

But long before he was forced out by the Supreme Court, the military had the upper hand yet again. And the judiciary’s actions against him and his family were widely seen as being supported by the army’s top ranks. Military officials have denied those accusations.

While some Pakistani politicians have hailed the court rulings as bold moves to fight corruption and impunity for the powerful, Mr. Sharif’s supporters insist that the judiciary was overstepping its role and was carrying out a political vendetta on behalf of the military and Mr. Sharif’s rivals.

The Panama Papers, documents leaked from a Panamanian law firm that catered to the world’s wealthy and powerful, revealed that three of Mr. Sharif’s children controlled shell companies through which they owned expensive residential properties in London. The revelations set off political turmoil and ultimately led the Supreme Court to disqualify him from office and order a criminal investigation into his behavior.

The Supreme Court had faulted the Sharif family for failing to provide documentation of the money they used to buy their London apartments. Investigators found that they were “living beyond their means,” and several of the documents they produced were declared fake or insufficient.

Mr. Sharif was in London when he was indicted, visiting his wife, who is undergoing medical treatment, his aides said.

After the original court ruling disqualifying him from holding a seat in Parliament, Mr. Sharif went to Lahore, his hometown. Upon his arrival, his vehicle was swarmed by thousands of supporters, in a show of continuing political support for the Sharif family and their political party, PML-N.

Mr. Safdar, Mr. Sharif’s son-in-law, was arrested this month at Islamabad’s main airport as he and Maryam Sharif were returning to Pakistan. He was released on bail after the couple appeared before an anticorruption court.

Speaking to reporters later, Maryam Sharif said she had “strongest reservations” over the court cases against her family but still decided to appear before the court.

“We are not the ones to be afraid of arrests,” she said.

The criminal proceedings in the court will add to the pressure on Mr. Sharif, who has remained determined to fight a political battle since his ouster.

This month, he was re-elected as president of PML-N after the party passed a bill that allows a person disqualified from serving in Parliament to hold a party office. Opponents denounced the move as undemocratic, but supporters said it signaled Mr. Sharif’s popularity and hold over the party.

There are some signs of strain within PML-N, however.

Hours after the indictment on Thursday, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, a cabinet member, held a news conference in which he urged Mr. Sharif to hand over the party leadership to his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif, who is chief minister of Punjab Province.

Nawaz Sharif told reporters in London that he would return to Pakistan and appear before the court in the next hearing, scheduled for Oct. 26.

The Libre I buy from Italy has a self-adhesive, waterproof white sensor that sticks to my arm for 14 days. It took some trial and error to get used to it. One sensor flipped off from over-aggressive toweling at the gym; another came loose after a backpack strap nicked it. Finally, rather than the spot on my outer arm that the manufacturer recommends, I tried putting the sensor on the inside of my arm, which is where it rests right now. It’s barely noticeable, although occasionally a small child will demand to know what it is.

I can see real-time results on a small digital reader (or an Android phone app): an arrow going up, down or level alongside my blood glucose number. The resulting data set — averages, trends and patterns — monitors my glucose status 24/7.

At first, scanning the Libre to check my results after breakfast, lunch or dinner was like bingeing on my favorite Netflix show. I’d show the readout, a blue line with peaks and valleys, to friends and family: Look how I stayed in the normal range all day!

Or the flip side: Look what happened after an intense workout. Even without food in my stomach, my blood sugar often, but not always, rose during exercise, which made planning tricky. The device gives me a window to the impact of cortisol, a stress hormone, which prompts a rush of glucose into my bloodstream.

After a year and a half of paying well over $2,000 out of pocket — six sensors every three months along with shipping fees — my condition has improved. My hemoglobin A1C now clocks in around 6.3 to 6.5, down from 7.0, and my doctor is thrilled. (An A1C level of 5.7 percent is considered normal in people without diabetes.)

Jeffrey Brewer, the chief executive of Bigfoot Biomedical, got his hands on a Libre early (on eBay) and plans to use it as a component of the artificial pancreas his company is working to develop. Mr. Brewer, who has a son with Type 1 diabetes and is a former president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, said it’s the first glucose monitor “that people really love.”

Dr. David Lam, associate director of the Mount Sinai Diabetes Center in New York, currently prescribes a Dexcom CGM, a device similar to the Libre but which requires calibrating with a finger stick twice a day, to his patients with Type 1 diabetes. (Insurance companies typically cover the cost of these devices for people with Type 1 but not Type 2 diabetes) Dr. Lam sees potential benefits in using the Libre or similar devices for anyone with diabetes. “It’s not only a diagnostic tool, it’s an educational tool. You learn how foods affect your body, you can see trends, and you can predict lows and highs,” he said.

Dr. Pratik Choudhary, a senior lecturer and consultant at the diabetes center at King’s College London who previewed the Libre early on, said there are limits to its usefulness. “It is just not cost effective at current prices,” he said. Dozens of studies have shown that continuous glucose monitoring leads to lower hemoglobin A1C results but for someone with tight control (like me), a half point percent change in A1C is a “minimal improvement to quality of life.”

Still, how do we quantify peace of mind?

The treasure trove of data I get from the Libre — days, weeks and months of data — has made it easier for me to manage my life. Learning that it would be available by prescription at major pharmacies in the States late this year seemed like great news.

But the model sold here will have a 10-day sensor, rather than the 14-day sensors used worldwide, along with an extended warm-up time — 12 hours for the F.D.A.-approved version versus one hour for my Italian model. That seems like a step backward. I also don’t know how expensive it will be, or whether my insurance under the increasingly shaky Affordable Care Act will cover it. Until those questions are answered, I may stick with my Milan-to-Manhattan route.

That tremor you felt last week was the dropping of a new John Green novel, “Turtles All the Way Down,” his first since “The Fault in Our Stars” and a seismic event not just in young people’s literature but in all people’s literature. The other tremor you felt was the dropping of a new Ron Chernow biography, “Grant,” the story of the general turned president tasked with the ultimate political challenge, uniting a post-civil-war society. We recommend them both — just don’t drop Chernow’s actual book; at 1,074 pages, it might break something.

THE COLLECTED ESSAYS OF ELIZABETH HARDWICK, Selected and with an introduction by Darryl Pinckney. (New York Review Books, $19.95.) “To move one’s way through Hardwick’s essays is to bump into brightness on nearly every page,” writes our critic Dwight Garner about this volume of writings by one of the co-founders of the New York Review of Books and a landmark American critic. Hardwick, who died in 2007, “had fresh eyes, quick wits, good feelers and was murderously well-read.”

TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN, by John Green. (Dutton, $19.99.) Green’s new novel, his first since the mega-best-selling “The Fault in Our Stars,” is “by far his most difficult to read,” writes our critic Jennifer Senior. “It’s also his most astonishing.” The story of Aza, a 16-year-old who suffers from anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, delves into familiar Green themes of love and suffering, working toward an ending that Senior describes as “so surprising and moving and true that I became completely unstrung.”

GRANT, by Ron Chernow. (Penguin Press, $40.) Chernow gives us a Grant for our time, comprehensively recounting not only the victories of the Civil War general but also the challenges of a president who fought against white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan and championed the right of eligible citizens to exercise the vote. “For all its scholarly and literary strengths,” writes former President Bill Clinton, “this book’s greatest service is to remind us of Grant’s significant achievements at the end of the war and after, which have too long been overlooked and are too important today to be left in the dark.”

GOOD ME BAD ME, by Ali Land. (Flatiron, $25.99.) This debut novel’s teenage narrator, Milly, is speaking to the mother she loves and misses. It’s a one-sided conversation because her mother is about to go on trial for murder, and her daughter is the one who turned her in. Land is a mental health nurse who has worked with traumatized children, and her portrait of Milly has a powerful sense of authenticity.

On the campaign trail, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pointing to rising wages for lower-income workers as part of a broader trumpeting of his economic record. He is hoping that signs of spreading prosperity will help win his governing coalition a renewed majority in Parliament, extending its five-year hold on power.

There are plenty of numbers for the prime minister to boast about. Output has grown for six straight quarters, the first time that has happened in more than a decade. The stock market is at a 21-year high. Jobs are plentiful, with unemployment at just 2.8 percent, the lowest level since the mid-1990s. Even Japan’s longtime economic nemesis, persistent consumer-price deflation, is being kept at bay.

In a television appearance this month, Mr. Abe compared his efforts to ratchet up economic growth — through a mix of stimulus policies widely known as Abenomics — to the 10 way stations that climbers pass on their way up Mount Fuji.

“We’re at Station Seven, and when you’re climbing it’s after that when things get the most difficult,” he said, inviting voters to grant him the chance to shoot for the summit.

Economic policy has taken a back seat in the campaign to other matters, notably national security and dueling claims over whether Mr. Abe used his influence to help right-wing supporters. A new opposition party created by Tokyo’s popular governor, Yuriko Koike, a former ally of Mr. Abe’s, has seen its support in the polls weaken after a promising start.

If Mr. Abe’s party, the Liberal Democratic Party, wins on Sunday, as appears to be likely, entrenched structural issues will be his next target, he said. His party has promised to increase spending on child care and education in a bid to encourage families to have more children and reverse an accelerating decline in Japan’s population, which has held back economic growth.

The opposition has struggled to formulate a counterattack. One challenge for Mr. Abe’s rivals is that the prime minister is a conservative who spends like a liberal. Though his policies have benefited business — he has cut corporate taxes and brought about a devaluation of the yen, giving Japanese companies with big overseas operations like Toyota Motor a leg up on foreign competitors — there has been no painful austerity to rally against.

Opposition parties have instead seized on a longstanding point of controversy: Japan’s sales tax. The national tax is scheduled to rise in 2019, to 10 percent from the current 8 percent, but Ms. Koike’s party and other groups say they would call off the increase if elected.

Mr. Abe, who has already delayed the rise once, says he will allow it to go ahead but will divert more of the money to social programs, rather than use it to bring down Japan’s chronic budget deficit, as was initially planned. A proposal to balance Japan’s budget, excluding interest payments on debt, by 2020 has been quietly set aside.

As the brilliant Spanish philosopher Javier Gomá Lanzón reminds us, most moral education happens by power of example. We publish the book of our lives every day through our actions, and through our conduct we teach one another what is worthy of admiration and what is worthy of disdain.

Public figures are the primary teachers in this mutual education. Our leaders have outsize influence in either weaving the moral order by their good example or ripping it to shreds by their bad example.

McCain’s career has had its low moments, as all of ours do — a banking scandal, Sarah Palin — but he exemplifies a practical standard of excellence to an extraordinary degree: enduring in Vietnam, seeking compromise legislation on everything from immigration reform to campaign spending, condemning torture after 9/11.

Moreover, I don’t think there’s another politician now living who devotes so much of his speeches to little biographies of his own exemplars, people like James Stockdale, Bud Day, Morris Udall and Master Sgt. Roy Benavidez. He has turned his own heroes into educational resources for his country, and used them to evangelize our national ideals.

These sorts of testimonies help weave a shared moral order, which is necessary to unite, guide and motivate a diverse country.

That is an essential bulwark in the age of Trump. That is what needs rebuilding. Books will someday be written on how Trump, this wounded and twisted man, became morally acceptable to tens of millions of Americans. But it must have something to do with the way over the past decades we have divorced private and public morality, as if private narcissism would have no effect on public conduct.

It must have something to do with the great tide of moral libertarianism from Herbert Marcuse on down. This tide taught that progress meant emancipating the individual from shared moral orders. It taught transgression was always delightful and that morality was individual and optional.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The acceptability of Trump must also have something to do with millions of religious voters being willing to abandon the practical wisdom of their faiths — that what exists inside a person is more important than what is external, that no bad tree yields good fruit, that you should never trade spiritual humility for worldly ferocity because in humility there is strength and in pride there is self-destruction.

We’ve reached a point in which the tasks of paideia have been abandoned and neglected. “One could say,” Gomá writes in his book “Public Exemplarity,” “that we are looking for the ideal of a virtuous republic composed of citizens relieved of the burden of citizenship.”

It’s not working out. Gomá continues, “In a time of freedom such as ours marked by subjectivism and vulgarity, a tolerance not tempered by virtue will lead inevitably toward barbarism.”

Barbarism and vulgarity we have in profusion. Through his daily utterances, Trump is influencing the nation in powerful ways, but none would call it paideia. Few would say he is spreading a contagion that we’d like our children to catch.

The moral fabric of society is invisible but essential. Some use their public position to dissolve it so they can have an open space for their selfishness. McCain is one of the strongest reweavers we have, and one of our best and most stubborn teachers.

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains — unlike computers — are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.

On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack — all while we should be performing the actual jobs we’re paid to be doing.

“Many people seem unaware that they might accomplish more with sustained, uninterrupted attention to one task,” said Nelson Cowan, a specialist in working memory at the University of Missouri. “It can be exhilarating to flit from one conversation to another on Facebook, but people don’t realize what’s missing in the process. It’s like having a delicious soup poured on your head. Often the people who think they’re the best at sharing attention between tasks are actually missing the most.”

Mr. LeDoux added: “The brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.”

They’re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.

Repeat After Me

As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks — reading, or saying words over and over — continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we’re already convinced we’re productive.

New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It’s the easiest brain game there is.

Take Your Time

Forget cramming. It didn’t work in college, it doesn’t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.

Robert Bjork, the chair of U.C.L.A.’s psychology department, said that quickly stuffing facts into our brains leads us to forget them in the long term (he even filmed a YouTube video series on the subject). When you rehearse knowledge and practice it often, it sticks, research has shown. So if you can incorporate what you’re trying to remember into daily life, ideally over time, your chances of retaining it drastically improve.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the “forgetting curve.”

To get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.

Sit Down and Stay Put

Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley’s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?

“The rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,” Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.

Multiple studies have found that procrastination leads to stress and downright kills focus. Stop engaging in useless tasks like surfing the web and just tackle whatever it is you need to work on. Then watch your focus soar and your memory improve. Dr. Cowan said both perform better when they aren’t cheating on each other pursuing so-called “life hacks.”

Incentivize Moments and Read Cues

Minds wander constantly. For students, adding frequent tests incentivizes focus because they know they’ll be quizzed. Harvard researchers report this approach decreases daydreaming by 50 percent, improving the result.

Daniel Schacter, a psychologist and a co-author of the Harvard study who also wrote “The Seven Sins Of Memory,” said the trick is focus. For some tasks, like online surfing, divided attention sounds harmless, but when we’re behind the wheel, it’s anything but. That forgetfulness can change the course of entire lives, the most serious vulnerability of memory, he added.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Schacter suggests employing cues — visual or verbal for items like keys — to associate places and things. And our electronic devices can help remind us, everything from mobile vaccination and immunization alerts to apps like Waze that can remind you that you left your baby in the car. It can sound silly, but it’s also tragic when we fail.

“Memory is very cue dependent,” he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. “Most say it could never happen to me, but it’s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don’t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.”

He added: “The really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.”

A simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you’re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.

“A lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,” Mr. Schacter said. “Doing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you’re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you’re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.”

Using DNA to Sketch What Victims Look Like; Some Call It Science Fiction
-Keywords-
['phenotyping', 'victims', 'dna', 'suspects', 'sketch', 'york', 'fiction', 'used', 'look', 'department', 'state', 'science', 'criminal', 'using']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
Police officials have said they are focused on using phenotyping to help identify victims, though they have not ruled out using it to search for suspects.
Chief Katranakis said state approval was not necessary because the Police Department was not using the technique to identify specific individuals.
But the state Department of Health said Parabon is required to obtain a license to perform phenotyping on DNA samples from New York.
DNA collected from crime scenes is routinely used to identify suspects and to convict or exonerate the accused, usually by comparing it to a suspect’s DNA or samples in a criminal database.
Forget about it.”The Police Department’s announcement that it was using phenotyping came amid fresh controversy over forensic DNA techniques.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Parabon’s tests revealed that Monique was primarily of sub-Saharan African descent, and not white as investigators had believed based on the color of the skin found on her remains.

Analysts used her sex and ancestry to create a generic sketch of a face from a database of demographic information, which they overlaid with traits gleaned from her genes: a deep brown complexion and brown eyes above a round nose.

As murder rates hover at historic lows, the Police Department is looking to emerging technologies like phenotyping to help solve old cases. The hope is that seeing a victim’s likeness will jog people’s memories. Deputy Chief Emanuel J. Katranakis, the commander of the Forensic Investigation Division, said the police have received several tips since releasing the likenesses of Monique and a male victim in another case in September.

But critics have raised concerns about the lack of peer-reviewed science behind the technology and the creeping expansion of how DNA is collected and used in criminal investigations, where it is susceptible to human bias, error and abuse.

Police officials have said they are focused on using phenotyping to help identify victims, though they have not ruled out using it to search for suspects. But relying on so few traits requires the police to cast a wide net, said Robert Perry, the legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

“The problem is, its use will place actual people, innocent of wrongdoing, under criminal suspicion without any basis in fact or science,” he said.

Chief Katranakis said that criticism overlooks phenotyping’s ability to help the police avoid targeting the wrong people in their investigations. “The power of exclusion from phenotyping is greater than that of inclusion,” he said.

For example, he said, the Police Department used the technique to determine that the suspect in the 2016 murder of a Queens jogger, Karina Vetrano, was of African descent and eventually arrested a suspect, Chanel Lewis, who is black.

Dozens of law enforcement agencies in places like Louisiana and North Carolina have similarly used phenotyping to search for suspects in cases where investigators had exhausted traditional leads.

But New York regulators say any private lab seeking to perform testing on DNA samples from New York must have authorization from state health officials.

Chief Katranakis said state approval was not necessary because the Police Department was not using the technique to identify specific individuals. But the state Department of Health said Parabon is required to obtain a license to perform phenotyping on DNA samples from New York.

The agency sent Parabon a warning last month, and Ben Rosen, a Health Department spokesman, said the company is currently seeking a permit. In an interview, Dr. Steven L. Armentrout, Parabon’s chief executive, declined to comment on the issue.

DNA testing has been around for decades, popularized on television and in the criminal justice system for its usefulness in determining paternity and ancestry. DNA collected from crime scenes is routinely used to identify suspects and to convict or exonerate the accused, usually by comparing it to a suspect’s DNA or samples in a criminal database.

Increasingly, geneticists have been discovering ways to use variations to predict specific physical traits. The potential applications might someday include allowing doctors to detect genetic diseases by scanning a patient’s face.

Parabon boasts that its Snapshot service, which police officials said cost $4,000 to $5,000 for each case, “accurately predicts the physical appearance and ancestry of an unknown person from DNA.”

Although interest in its testing has grown, Parabon has yet to publish its detailed methodology for peer review.

Much of the science around how genetics determines facial appearance has focused on the role of individual genes. But Dr. Armentrout said Parabon’s facial predictions are based on its research on how genes work together to shape the face.

“For a complex trait, this is unequivocally the way genetics works,” he said.

But critics say the company is promising more than science has determined it can deliver. Dr. Yaniv Erlich, a computer science professor at Columbia University who studies genetics, said the idea that phenotyping could meaningfully predict something as complex as individual looks is “on the verge of science fiction.”

“Ancestry?” he said. “Sure, that’s fairly simple. Kinship, too. Phenotyping with faces? Forget about it.”

The Police Department’s announcement that it was using phenotyping came amid fresh controversy over forensic DNA techniques. The state inspector general is reviewing a request from criminal defense attorneys to investigate methods used for several years by the city medical examiner’s office, an inquiry that could have implications for thousands of prosecutions.

Among scientists, the idea that phenotyping can predict faces has provoked debate. A geneticist was criticized for a recently published paper in which he claimed to be able to identify anonymous people’s faces by sequencing their genes. Reviewers and a co-author said the paper, which was intended to raise privacy concerns, overstated what was achieved.

Dr. Erlich wrote that most of the trait predictions, such as height and face shape, were made using simple demographic data rather than trait-specific markers. “It is like the authors needed to get to the supermarket and decided to build a spacecraft to make the trip,” he said.

Even amid such debates, the role of DNA in criminal investigations continues to expand in New York. The state Commission on Forensic Science, which approves methods used in state crime labs, adopted guidelines for familial testing — DNA searches for relatives of potential suspects – that took effect Wednesday, despite protests from criminal defense and civil liberties lawyers.

The Legal Aid Society, in a brief filed with the commission, said that the panel, which was lobbied by the police, prosecutors and Ms. Vetrano’s family, does not have the authority to implement familial DNA testing.

Allison Lewis, a staff attorney in Legal Aid’s DNA unit, and David Loftis, the attorney in charge of post-conviction and forensic litigation, said the expanded roles of DNA in the criminal justice system in recent years go far beyond what the Legislature had in mind when it adopted laws compelling people convicted of certain crimes to submit swabs.

They warned that without clear rules from lawmakers, the technology will be used to justify something akin to stop-and-frisk, where people in black and Latino communities are targeted for genetic surveillance, regardless of whether they are suspected of a crime.

Chief Katranakis said the Police Department was “fully aware” of the uncertainty surrounding phenotyping. Officials conducted a thorough evaluation of the science behind it and consulted with industry experts before deeming it appropriate for use in a limited number of cases where investigators have nothing to work with, he said.

Nothing is what the police had when a man’s skull was found in July 2005 in a community garden in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The teeth had been removed, preventing investigators from identifying the victim with dental records. Phenotyping analysts created an image from his DNA and adjusted it to his skull shape, getting closer to what he looked like, Chief Katranakis said.

Investigators found the victim’s torso in a trash bin in East Williamsburg and traced it to 128 Gates Avenue in Bushwick, near where an accused serial killer lived when two of his teenage neighbors disappeared. Their bodies were found dismembered in 2004 and 2005.

The police are trying to determine whether the same suspect, Kwauhuru Govan, might be his killer.

The karst peaks of Guilin, in the Guangxi region of southern China, touch the clouds in centuries of Chinese ink-brush paintings. But most Americans know them only as part of the backdrop for the planet of the Wookiees in “Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith.”

And Guilin mi fen (rice noodles) — for which the city is as famed as for its beauty — are still a rarity in New York. Taste of Guilin in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, serves them hot and quick; so did, briefly, a now-shuttered storefront in Flushing, Queens.

At Yuan, which opened in the East Village in July, the noodles are the centerpiece of a menu distractingly stocked with stray dim sum and cross-regional Chinese dishes. Ignore them. The noodles are what you’ve come for.

When the bowl lands on the table, all that is visible is a crowded topography of deep-fried soybeans, ready to cave in with a crunch that echoes in the skull; clips of pickled long beans shining and sour from a wallow in vinegar; and chile flakes, scallion and torn cilantro, looking as if they were flung to the winds. Thin panels of long-stewed beef, agreeably pliant, overlap pork belly cut like bacon and thrust under the broiler until the edges are somehow crisp and chewy at once.

There’s no shortage of images from New York City’s subway system, with millions of smartphone-toting riders each day. Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

“They have to realize the world has changed,” Ms. Klobuchar said.

Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid television, radio and print political advertising has been subject for years. The Federal Election Commission justified the so-called internet exemption rule by declaring the internet “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.”

That attitude has many fewer adherents after the revelations that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, Facebook sold more than $100,000 worth of ads to a Russian company linked to the Kremlin, while Google sold at least $4,700 worth of ads to accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government.

Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.

“It’s ridiculous,” said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. “We need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew — and we all knew — that this was possible.”

The new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.

The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 “are a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,” Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.

The regulatory pressure comes at a particularly trying time for Google, Facebook and other tech giants. The companies, once celebrated as benevolent drivers of innovation and economic growth, are facing mounting criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for complex tax avoidance efforts, the hosting of pages used in sex trafficking, lax privacy protections and increasing monopoly power.

In response, they have ramped up lobbying and public relations campaigns, with Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, last week whirring through Washington on an apology tour and charm offensive.

Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.

After initially resisting requests to turn over Russian-linked ads, Facebook has provided them to a congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But Google has yet to do so, and neither company has made the ads public.

And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.

When the Federal Election Commission moved to strengthen its online disclaimer requirements in 2011 and again last year, the companies either ignored requests for input or suggested that new rules could “stand in the way of innovation,” as Facebook asserted in a 2011 comment to the commission.

Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity — that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie’s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.

While the election commission approved Google’s request, which was submitted in 2010, by a 4-to-2 vote, it deadlocked 3 to 3 on Facebook’s request, which was submitted the next year. Facebook nonetheless proceeded as if it was exempt from the disclaimer requirement, declining to mandate that political advertisements on its platform list their sponsors.

Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It was “kind of like the chickens coming home to roost,” said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.

She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that “the savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.” because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.

Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.

“Russia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,” he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because — according to Facebook — they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”

Citing United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, “The Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Critics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, “but they were silent,” said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.

“And they are still trying to avoid regulation,” Mr. Noble said.

A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.

And the company’s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, “We look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution” to “achieve transparency in political advertising.”

She pointed out that the company had enacted new policies to self-police its ads, which Facebook asserted in a company blog post “would have caught these malicious actors faster and prevented more improper ads from running” in 2016.

Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said that strict ads policies, including limits on political-ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion, already exist at Google. But the company is “taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.”

Emily Sarokin may not have completely understood how a major auction house worked when she joined Christie’s New York six years ago.

“I thought it was ‘Antiques Roadshow,’” Ms. Sarokin, the vice president and director of gallery operations and client services, said in a recent interview at the Rockefeller Center gallery, laughing at herself as she prepared for the Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art auction in mid-September. “I had no idea.”

She knows now that it is “an immense machine.” In 2016, there were 84 sales and more than 100 exhibitions at Christie’s New York location alone. They involved art and other precious goods worth about 1.5 billion pounds. That is almost $2 billion (but employees tend to think in British currency because the head office is in London, where the company was founded in 1766).

The number of details involved in creating any one of those events in 57,000 square feet of Midtown exhibition space is complicated. Ms. Sarokin, 29, described working intensely and constantly with shippers, contractors, riggers, lawyers and (of course) the art handlers.

In Search of the Balkan Soul

-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
Thodoris Nikolaou has spent the last three years — and counting — crisscrossing the Balkan Peninsula to create a visual mosaic of the region’s people and their stories. But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

Though Monika Bulaj grew up in Communist Poland, she was nonetheless a devoutly Catholic child who studied mystics and dreamed of a life as a cloistered nun. But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

The subsidies, estimated at $7 billion this year, were challenged in federal court by the House in 2014 and found unconstitutional because Congress had not approved them. Mr. Trump announced last week that he was cutting them off and Mr. Alexander said he feared millions of people could now find insurance out of their financial reach.

Despite the serious negotiations, there was no firm commitment that a compromise would reach the Senate floor if one could be struck. In fact, Mr. Alexander deferred to Mr. McConnell last month when Mr. McConnell wanted to take one last shot at overturning the health care law. He broke off his talks with Ms. Murray, resuming them only when the repeal effort faltered once again.

All sides agree that Mr. Trump — in conversations with Mr. Alexander and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader — strongly encouraged the bipartisan talks and initially seemed to embrace the agreement to restore the subsidies as a way to buy time for another repeal push. So backers of the plan were blindsided when the president said on Twitter on Wednesday that he could not back what he considered an insurance industry bailout.

Mr. Schumer said the president was undercutting himself by wavering on deals he had helped set in motion, not just on health care but also on issues like immigration. Mr. Schumer suggested that Mr. Trump caved to conservative opposition to the health care compromise.

“This president cannot govern if whenever the hard right frightens him and says, ‘Jump,’ he says, ‘How high?’” Mr. Schumer said.

Backers of the compromise face a tough task in selling the idea to many Republicans who would now be voting not to repeal the health care law, but to temporarily prop it up to avoid a breakdown in the marketplace. In addition, many on Capitol Hill say the compromise could be an important first step toward stabilizing the overall program, making future attempts to repeal it even more difficult.

Mr. Trump’s view will be crucial. His endorsement could provide important political cover for those nervous about voting to bolster the health care law while his opposition could cause Republicans to flee, fearing they will come under attack from the president and his allies.

Mr. Alexander is not retreating. Trying to build momentum, he and Ms. Murray introduced the legislation on Thursday along with two dozen leading Republican and Democratic co-sponsors — an almost unheard-of event on a major bill in this highly polarized environment.

Among Republicans backing the measure were Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, long active in health policy; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the authors of the most recent repeal plan; Bob Corker, Mr. Alexander’s Tennessee colleague who has been feuding with the president; and the group who thwarted Republican repeal efforts, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I don’t believe Congress will want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue,” Mr. Alexander said.

He and Ms. Murray said that they had built in protections to make sure the money went to consumers and that it was a mischaracterization to call it an industry bailout. They said both sides gave substantial ground in the talks. Ms. Murray told fellow Democrats this week that it was the toughest bargaining she had been involved in as a senator.

“It sends a powerful message that when members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done,” Ms. Murray said of the negotiation.

But to a large degree, the ultimate success of the talks depends on Mr. McConnell. He has been quiet so far about the bill and whether he would push it forward. The Senate would no doubt have to give it a strong vote for the plan to have any chance of moving through the House.

The support from a growing list of Republican co-sponsors is no guarantee that the Senate will consider the bill if Mr. McConnell views it as too politically risky. He refused to bring to the floor last year a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul that had broad support because of political considerations — despite the fact that Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, was a chief author.

Mr. Alexander has repeatedly predicted that some version of his new legislation will become law by the end of the year. For him to be proved right, he is going to need some help from his good friend Mitch McConnell.

“A student is a consumer of the product of education,” he said in an interview this week. “Greater transparency is going to empower the consumer.”

The pair’s efforts could also provide a road map for people who do not want to be tripped up by the complexity, and it starts with the Net Price Calculator Improvement Act. These calculators, which allow college shoppers to input data and get a rough sense of how much financial aid a school might offer them, have not been warmly embraced by many colleges. As I’ve reported in the past, some have even blocked third-party efforts to make it easier for families to compare the results that the calculators spit out.

To the senators, these calculators are vital, given that too many families dismiss colleges with high sticker prices out of hand, without realizing that few people pay the sticker price at many private colleges anymore. So their bill would force schools to put the calculator on the same webpage where families look for cost and admission information. Plus, it would encourage the Department of Education to develop a universal calculator containing the data of every college, which would make comparisons easier.

Bill No. 2 is the Understanding the True Cost of College Act, but a better name for it might be the Colleges Don’t Write Very Clear Financial Aid Award Letters Act. When a college offers you aid before you’ve decided whether or not to attend, it sends you a letter with a bunch of numbers that purport to explain it all. These letters, however, are often so badly crafted that some of Senator Franken’s constituents complained that they could not tell whether they were being offered grants (which they did not have to pay back) or loans (which they generally did).

Part of the problem comes from industry jargon. There are descriptive terms or loan names that financial aid administrators believe they must use to comply with regulations, and others, like “Fed Direct Unsub Loan,” that simply exist nowhere else in the English language. Yet they stuff the letters full of them and send them off to teenagers.

“Most financial aid administrators mean well,” said Brendan Williams, director of knowledge for uAspire, which helps students and others decode the financial aid system. “But sometimes they lose sight of where students are when getting these letters. It’s a foreign language almost.”

The True Cost bill would mandate the use of a standard template for award letters, so that recipients would have a clear sense of what college would cost, how much money they might have to borrow and how much grant money was being offered, free and clear.

“Let people compare apples to apples instead of apples to oranges,” Senator Grassley said.

This could — and should — have happened a long time ago, for it’s not a new issue. In 2007, Kim Clark, who was a colleague of mine at Fortune Magazine 20 years ago, used a fellowship to set up a website explaining just how confusing many award letters were. Her “decoder” feature translated a handful of actual letters so that people could cut through the muddle.

Several years after that, a clear-as-day sample letter appeared on the Department of Education’s website, but schools were not forced to use it. Many refuse to do so to this day. Why is this?

“They don’t want to make it easy to understand the true costs and to compare them,” said Ms. Clark, who now works for the Education Writers Association. Tweedy traditionalists, after all, don’t want a price war to get in the way of the gauzy appeal of reputation, tradition and other things that are hard to put a value on.

Mr. Williams, whose organization would not exist but for the absurd complexity of the system, has some sympathy for the writers of said letters.

“It’s their job to communicate with students, and, let’s be honest really, to try to get students to enroll at their college,” he said.

Still, he has no patience for common practices like formatting letters to count loans as “awards,” as if the school were doing families some kind of a favor. “It drives me bonkers,” he said.

The third bill, the Know Before You Owe Act, co-sponsored with Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, is aimed at giving students a running total of their debt and its ramifications during each year at school. Currently, students get some loan counseling on the way in and some more on the way out, but that’s it, and it’s often not very good.

If this bill passes, the annual check-in will include an explanation of students’ projected debt-to-income ratio based on the average salary for people in their major. Borrowers would also have to manually enter the amount of federal loans they wished to use, so that they’d be making a conscious decision about debt and not simply checking a box to grab everything they were eligible to borrow.

These bills will probably not get much of a hearing on their own, so they’re more likely to be included in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Whether that will happen (as it is supposed to) in the next year or so is anyone’s guess.

In the meantime, there is nothing stopping you from doing all of the things that these bills would make the schools do for you. Use a search engine to find the net price calculator for the schools that interest you, as some schools hide them on their sites. You can also go to College Abacus’s website to compare the results from different schools, if the schools haven’t blocked College Abacus’s tool, that is.

Once the award letters start arriving, consult Ms. Clark’s letter-reading advice that ran in Money Magazine. You should also look at the Institute for College Access and Success’s tips for interpreting the documents and the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators’ glossary.

As for do-it-yourself counseling, consult the column I wrote two years ago in which I asked young adults with debt to discuss the things about the system that they wished someone had told them when they were 18 years old.

Meanwhile, any bipartisanship is cause for encouragement and celebration.

“We’re kind of an odd couple, Franken and I,” Senator Grassley said. “But I hope it also holds a lesson.”

He wants us to know that we can all get along, really. So noted. But the lesson for me is that this blasted system has grown so complex that even people who normally disagree have concluded that it is an enormous problem. So there is little doubt, bills or not, that it will take a very long time before the process of fixing it comes to the end.

When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy
-Keywords-
['came', 'simmons', 'study', 'field', 'simonsohn', 'research', 'social', 'cuddy', 'power', 'paper', 'science', 'revolution', 'amy']
-SUMMARY ARTICLE-
(“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.)
A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy.
On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend.
It’s not good.”If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career.
“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.
-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-
The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.
