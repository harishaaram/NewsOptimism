The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up. At 31 times the next 12 months’ estimated earnings, it trades at a higher multiple than Visa or MasterCard. Justifying such a rapid rise requires Chief Executive Dan Schulman to execute well on four crucial strategies.\\n\\nThe PayPal logo is seen at a high-tech park in Beersheba, southern Israel August 28, 2017. Picture taken August 28, 2017. REUTERS/Amir Cohen\\n\\nPayPal’s split from eBay in 2015 helped the company to capture multiple tailwinds as consumers increased their shift toward more convenient payment options than cash and checks – and grew increasingly impatient with the slow pace of technological change at traditional banks. The rise of e-commerce has helped, too. The biggest benefit, however, is the growth of smartphones.\\n\\nMobile transactions are growing about 50 percent annually, and now account for more than a third of volume, according to the company. PayPal’s Venmo service has even faster velocity. It’s a payments-cum-social media service that lets people send money to each other for free and post comments about what it’s for. Venmo handled $9 billion of payments last quarter, 93 percent more than the same period last year.\\n\\nTrouble is, Schulman’s outfit gets precious little financial benefit for this service. Charging merchants to take Venmo payments, a service which launched this week, should change that. The risk is that the millennials who made the person-to-person feature so successful may balk at paying stores in the same manner.\\n\\nSchulman’s second challenge is to ensure PayPal’s burgeoning lending business doesn’t overheat. The company’s loan portfolio now exceeds $6 billion, but the bigger it gets, the more investors will worry about rising defaults, which could drive down PayPal’s stock multiple. He also needs to make progress on his goal of increasing average usage of PayPal from two to three times a month toward his aspirational goal of two to three times a week.\\n\\nFinally, Schulman needs to renegotiate the firm’s contract with eBay that expires in 2020. That accounted for 22 percent of revenue last year. There’s a lot of mutual dependence that ought to mean the odds of a split are low. But eBay has plenty of options. That Square could lose Starbucks and Costco could ditch American Express should convince Schulman to tread carefully.\\n\\nHe does, though, have momentum on his side. The future is his to lose.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nIpo, editore di Nature prepara sbarco in borsa nel 2018 - fonti\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'che\\', \\'nel\\', \\'di\\', \\'borsa\\', \\'2018\\', \\'ipo\\', \\'il\\', \\'fonti\\', \\'editore\\', \\'ha\\', \\'prepara\\', \\'una\\', \\'riviste\\', \\'holtzbrinck\\', \\'società\\', \\'sbarco\\', \\'la\\', \\'nature\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nFRANCOFORTE, 18 ottobre (Reuters) - SpringerNature, editore delle riviste scientifiche ‘Nature’ e ‘Scientific American’, sta preparando uno sbarco in borsa nel 2018 che valuta la società fino a 4 miliardi di euro.\\nLa società di recente ha sondato le banche per l‘operazione che dovrebbe avvenire già a giugno o luglio 2018 per consentire l‘uscita di uno degli azionisti, secondo le fonti.\\nE’ nata nel 2015 dalla fusione della divisione Macmillan Science and Education di Holtzbrinck con il business Springer di BC Partners, che pubblica libri e riviste scientifici, tecnici e medici.\\nAll‘epoca la società venne valutata più di 5 miliardi di euro incluso il debito.\\nNel 2015 BC Partners ha detto che puntava a una quotazione del business entro due o tre anni.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nFRANCOFORTE, 18 ottobre (Reuters) - SpringerNature, editore delle riviste scientifiche ‘Nature’ e ‘Scientific American’, sta preparando uno sbarco in borsa nel 2018 che valuta la società fino a 4 miliardi di euro.\\n\\nLo riferiscono alcune fonti vicine al dossier.\\n\\nLa società di recente ha sondato le banche per l‘operazione che dovrebbe avvenire già a giugno o luglio 2018 per consentire l‘uscita di uno degli azionisti, secondo le fonti.\\n\\nSpringerNature è una joint venture controllata al 53% dall‘editore tedesco Holtzbrinck e per il resto dall‘operatore di private equity BC Partners.\\n\\nE’ nata nel 2015 dalla fusione della divisione Macmillan Science and Education di Holtzbrinck con il business Springer di BC Partners, che pubblica libri e riviste scientifici, tecnici e medici.

Not so on Thursday (October 19). The choreography on the first day of this European Union summit showing May talking animatedly with the EU\\'s most important leaders - France\\'s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\\'s Angela Merkel. That as May urged a new dynamic on Brexit talks. At a summit dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May appealed to EU leaders to help her silence her critics at home and break a deadlock in the talks. Merkel responding to that with words of support. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING: \"Contrary to how it is sometimes represented in the British press - this process is moving forward step by step. Sometimes the impression is given that after just a few weeks we should now already be announcing the end. To be clear, I find that absolutely absurd.\" Talks have stalled largely over how much Britain owes when it leaves the bloc. EU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill. They are expected on Friday (October 20) to set a target of December for London to improve its divorce settlement offer. But in a conciliatory gesture they are also likely to call on their staff to prepare for the next stage of talks. That may be enough for May to stave off calls by several Brexit campaigners back home for her to walk away from the negotiating table.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBull markets don\\'t die of old age, says Andy Kapyrin\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'0211\\', \\'black\\', \\'dont\\', \\'bull\\', \\'old\\', \\'kapyrin\\', \\'markets\\', \\'andy\\', \\'age\\', \\'30\\', \\'die\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n30 years on: Could there be another Black Monday?\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n30 years on: Could there be another Black Monday? - 02:11\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nOil prices flat; weak U.S. demand offsets Mideast tensions\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'prices\\', \\'tensions\\', \\'exports\\', \\'bpd\\', \\'million\\', \\'kurdistan\\', \\'shipments\\', \\'oil\\', \\'offsets\\', \\'rosneft\\', \\'crude\\', \\'market\\', \\'mideast\\', \\'makes\\', \\'flat\\', \\'demand\\', \\'weak\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Friday in see-saw trade, under pressure from weak U.S. demand but drawing support from a sharp decline in Iraqi crude exports due to tensions in the Kurdistan region.\\nRussia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.\\nOlivier Jakob, chief strategist at consultancy Petromatrix, said the deal with Rosneft “makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows”.\\n“The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.\\nU.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Friday in see-saw trade, under pressure from weak U.S. demand but drawing support from a sharp decline in Iraqi crude exports due to tensions in the Kurdistan region.\\n\\nA man walks at a petrol station in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia October 8, 2017.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\\n\\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct. 19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels, reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts.\\n\\nThe move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn-states like Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and Valero Energy Corp who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief.\\n\\nThe letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months. The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul.\\n\\nThe most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said..\\n\\nThe so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said.\\n\\nPruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas.\\n\\nPruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies.\\n\\nThose ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\\n\\nBut Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration’s promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers.\\n\\n“It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,” Grassley said in a statement.\\n\\nIn the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog.\\n\\nRenewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was “grateful for Administrator Pruitt’s epiphany on the road to the RFS.”\\n\\nThe program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a coalition of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program.\\n\\n“If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,” Blair said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nHoneywell raises full-year forecast; shares hit record\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'forecast\\', \\'honeywell\\', \\'fullyear\\', \\'raises\\', \\'aerospace\\', \\'record\\', \\'share\\', \\'billion\\', \\'business\\', \\'sales\\', \\'shares\\', \\'hit\\', \\'company\\', \\'rose\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) raised it full-year sales forecast as its aerospace business sees higher demand for spare parts and services such as maintenance from the airline industry.\\nREUTERS/Eric Miller/File PhotoHoneywell’s shares rose as much as 1.5 percent to a record high of $145.80 in morning trading on Friday.\\nThe company now expects total sales of $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion from $39.3 billion to $40.0 billion estimated previously.\\nFull-year sales growth forecast, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, was raised to 3-4 percent from 2-4 percent.\\nThe U.S. industrial conglomerate also reaffirmed its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings per share.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) raised it full-year sales forecast as its aerospace business sees higher demand for spare parts and services such as maintenance from the airline industry.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A view of the corporate sign outside the Honeywell International Automation and Control Solutions manufacturing plant in Golden Valley, Minnesota, U.S. January 28, 2010.

The $200 billion telecom firm reported a rise in wireless subscribers on Thursday. But the gap is narrowing. Cable rivals Comcast and Charter are also offering mobile services, AT&T is trying to become a media company and Sprint and T-Mobile may yet merge. A heavy debt load hobbles Verizon’s ability to quickly change lanes.\\n\\nThe ticker and trading information for Verizon is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. June 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\\n\\nVerizon said it had a net addition of more than 600,000 wireless customers, including those for tablets and other devices, who pay a monthly bill in the third quarter. Earnings were flat at $3.7 billion, but $10 billion in cost savings targeted by Chief Executive Lowell McAdam over the next four years should help the bottom line.\\n\\nLooming over Verizon is the chance that Sprint and T-Mobile US may finally combine. The third and fourth carriers in the United States argue that a tie-up would better position them to compete against Verizon and its peer AT&T. Adding to the pressure, both Comcast and Charter Communications are launching their own mobile initiatives. Sure, Comcast is using Verizon’s backbone for cellular but it would be unwise to underestimate the ability of Brian Roberts’ company to turn foe.\\n\\nThe options for Verizon to buy its way out of trouble are limited. Three years ago the telecom firm closed a $130 billion purchase of the remaining 45 percent stake of the venture Verizon Wireless from Vodafone. The amount of debt on the balance sheet - $117 billion as of the end of September – gives it limited flexibility.\\n\\nThere is a possibility of a bid for satellite distributor Dish, which has an enterprise value of about $40 billion, but AT&T sounds a cautious note about how big deals can pan out. The second-largest mobile carrier warned earlier it lost 90,000 U.S. video subscribers in the third quarter because of competition and weather. AT&T bought satellite firm DirecTV in 2015 for $67 billion and is preparing to close on its $109 billion deal for Time Warner.\\n\\nMcAdam may yet choose to copy AT&T’s media strategy and go beyond the $9 billion or so he spent on AOL and Yahoo, though paying a premium may be a stretch. Verizon has boasted of raising its dividend for 11 years in a row. If it sticks to that, it risks being stuck in neutral.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBreakingviews Video\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'spare\\', \\'breakingviews\\', \\'possible\\', \\'predecessors\\', \\'video\\', \\'likely\\', \\'reduced\\', \\'targets\\', \\'rob\\', \\'richard\\', \\'ranging\\', \\'preview\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nRob Cox and Richard Beales preview GE’s forthcoming earnings, the first for new CEO John Flannery, and likely changes ranging from grounding his predecessor’s spare airplane to possible reduced financial targets and dividend cuts.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nRob Cox and Richard Beales preview GE’s forthcoming earnings, the first for new CEO John Flannery, and likely changes ranging from grounding his predecessor’s spare airplane to possible reduced financial targets and dividend cuts.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nDrugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'credits\\', \\'mylan\\', \\'source\\', \\'coal\\', \\'million\\', \\'unlikely\\', \\'refined\\', \\'tax\\', \\'companys\\', \\'plants\\', \\'companies\\', \\'drugmaker\\', \\'gets\\', \\'boost\\', \\'company\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nInfographic ID: \\'2sQaEQL\\'These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal.\\nIt is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.\\nThe loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.\\nLast year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced.\\nMylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO - EpiPen auto-injection epinephrine pens manufactured by Mylan NV pharmaceutical company for use by severe allergy sufferers are seen in Washington, U.S. on August 24, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo\\n\\nBut a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.\\n\\nSince 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2sQaEQL\\'\\n\\nThese refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.\\n\\nMylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.\\n\\nFuture tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.\\n\\nMylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.\\n\\nMylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.\\n\\nA person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.\\n\\nMylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.\\n\\nWells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.\\n\\n“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.\\n\\n“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”\\n\\nMylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.\\n\\n“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”\\n\\nMylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”\\n\\nOther companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.\\n\\nDevlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.\\n\\nNew York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.\\n\\n“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.\\n\\nCOAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011\\n\\nMylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.\\n\\nMylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.\\n\\nMylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.\\n\\nReuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.\\n\\nMylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.\\n\\nMylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.\\n\\nBut the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\n\\nAccording to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTrump calls Russia collusion story \\'a hoax\\'\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'ran\\', \\'collusion\\', \\'russia\\', \\'president\\', \\'real\\', \\'uranium\\', \\'calls\\', \\'donald\\', \\'reporter\\', \\'state\\', \\'hoax\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nU.S. President Donald Trump says the \\'\\'real\\'\\' Russia story involves a deal on U.S. uranium mines under the Obama administration struck when Hillary Clinton ran the State Department and not the \\'\\'hoax\\'\\' collusion story.\\nRough Cut (no reporter narration).\\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday (October 19) that the real Russia story involves a deal on U.S. uranium mines under the Obama administration when Hillary Clinton ran the State Department and not the \"hoax\" collusion story.\\nThe Senate and House intelligence committees are two of the main congressional panels probing allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the U.S. election to boost Republican President Donald Trump\\'s chances of winning, and possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.\\nMoscow has denied the allegations, and Trump has repeatedly dismissed any accusations of collusion.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nU.S. President Donald Trump says the \\'\\'real\\'\\' Russia story involves a deal on U.S. uranium mines under the Obama administration struck when Hillary Clinton ran the State Department and not the \\'\\'hoax\\'\\' collusion story.

She declined to discuss Trump’s views on the ethnicity of political appointees.\\n\\nOne day before Trump took office on Jan. 20, his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet’s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.\\n\\n“People (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration,” he told reporters.\\n\\nThe mid-level political positions, known as “Schedule C” and “non-career SES” posts, numbered 1,051 in June, according to most recent data published in late September.\\n\\nU.S. President Donald Trump is surrounded by his cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (L-R), Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Linda McMahon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tom Price, as he signs an executive order entitled \"Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch\" in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2017.

The mid-level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations.\\n\\nIn recent decades, such jobs would account for about half of some 4,000 positions that get filled anew with every change of administration.

Bush. Between 2006-2008, the only Bush years covered by OPM gender, race and ethnicity data, men made up 60 percent of mid-level staff and 88 percent described themselves as non-Hispanic white.\\n\\nHowever, the United States has become more diverse over the past decade, making the numbers for this administration less representative of America’s demographic makeup than was the case under Bush.\\n\\nIn 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population. Now that share is 4 percentage points lower, U.S. Census figures show.\\n\\nAmong Republican registered voters, the share of those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white has edged down from 88 percent in 2008 to 86 percent just before the 2016 presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.\\n\\nWomen also have a larger share of overall U.S. jobs than during the Bush years. Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008.

Le opinioni espresse sono solo le sue)\\n\\nUn cambio al vertice, per la Banca d‘Italia, è la migliore tra diverse opzioni negative.\\n\\nIl bilancio con luci ed ombre del governatore Ignazio Visco durante la crisi bancaria italiana indebolisce l‘ipotesi di un rinnovo del suo mandato. Le critiche dei politici nei suoi confronti minacciano l‘indipendenza della banca centrale e potrebbero sconsigliare una sua sostituzione. Ma se Visco restasse al suo posto, rischierebbe di diventare in un‘anatra zoppa.\\n\\nIl mandato di Visco scade alla fine del mese. Fino a lunedì la riconferma del governatore per altri sei anni sembrava una mera formalità. Adesso invece non è più certa, dopo che martedì la Camera ha approvato una mozione del Pd critica sul ruolo svolto da Bankitalia durante la crisi delle banche e dopo che giovedì l‘ex premier Silvio Berlusconi è intervenuto nello stesso senso.\\n\\nCi sono buoni motivi per criticare Visco. La banca centrale non è riuscita a individuare le enormi perdite da derivati occultate del Monte dei Paschi. Lo scandalo, scoperto a inizio 2013, si è concluso col salvataggio di Stato della banca toscana.\\n\\nVisco è stato anche lento nel costringere le banche italiane a far emergere i crediti in sofferenza, prolungando così, probabilmente, la recessione economica. Durante il suo mandato i contribuenti, gli investitori e istituzioni semi statali hanno speso oltre 60 miliardi di euro per risolvere la crisi di 10 banche, secondo i calcoli del quotidiano “La Repubblica”.\\n\\nTuttavia, anche scaricare Visco così tardi comporta rischi. Il governo non si è preoccupato di vagliare seriamente candidature alternative, anche se ci sono diversi qualificati candidati italiani. Una nomina affrettata potrebbe non essere rigorosa. Inoltre, un nuovo governatore potrebbe essere considerato come il risultato di un mercanteggiamento politico, e indebolire così la reputazione della banca centrale. Ma se Visco restasse, correrebbe il rischio di essere il bersaglio di accuse quotidiane da parte di tutto l‘arco politico prima delle elezioni del 2018. Una commissione di inchiesta sul sistema bancario appena insediata potrebbe diventare teatro di altri attacchi politici, piuttosto che l‘opportunità di fare chiarezza sulle decisioni della banca centrale.\\n\\nÈ vero che, oggi, il governatore potrebbe sembrare una figura meno importante dal momento che le funzioni di vigilanza più importanti sono state trasferite alla Banca Centrale Europea. Ma Banca d‘Italia rimane centrale per la gestione quotidiana delle operazioni bancarie italiane. Se Visco decidesse di lasciare, potrebbe disinnescare le tensioni politiche e contribuire a preservare l‘integrità della banca centrale. Sarebbe il risultato meno negativo.\\n\\nSul sito www.reuters.it altre notizie Reuters in italiano.

We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”\\n\\nThe push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.\\n\\nSome 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.\\n\\nMany of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.\\n\\n“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.\\n\\nA signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.\\n\\nTrump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.\\n\\nAction may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.\\n\\n“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview earlier on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.\\n\\n“You will see this continue to escalate until the end of the year,” he said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n\\'Unacceptably high\\' number of Afghans flee military training in U.S.: report\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'united\\', \\'sigar\\', \\'high\\', \\'training\\', \\'afghan\\', \\'security\\', \\'report\\', \\'states\\', \\'number\\', \\'flee\\', \\'military\\', \\'unacceptably\\', \\'afghans\\', \\'trainees\\', \\'forces\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nSIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.\\nIn 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.\\nMany of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.\\nAlthough Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.\\nThat has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nKABUL (Reuters) - Afghan soldiers and police brought to the United States for training go “absent without leave” at far higher rates than those of any other country, potentially imperilling efforts to assist Afghan security forces, a U.S. watchdog said on Friday.\\n\\nAfghan Uniform Police and soldiers from the U.S. Army 4th Brigade Combat Team provide 360-degree security outside a compound during training at Ft.

SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.\\n\\nIn 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.\\n\\nThat’s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.\\n\\n“The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,” it concluded.\\n\\nOnly 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.\\n\\nMany of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.\\n\\nAlthough Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.\\n\\nIn response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend.\\n\\nThat has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away. “If a student absconds, it affects his unit,” one Afghan officer told investigators.\\n\\nBetween 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n中移动首三季净利同比增4.6% 受通信服务收入增加带动\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'millions\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'受通信服务收入增加带动\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'中移动首三季净利同比增46\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nACTUALIZA 1-Comisión legislativa México sube estimados petróleo y tipo de cambio para reconstrucción por sismos\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'reconstrucción\\', \\'sube\\', \\'por\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'sismos\\', \\'para\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'méxico\\', \\'tipo\\', \\'legislativa\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'y\\', \\'petróleo\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n《MCGEEVER专栏》大型银行债券交易低迷遥遥无绝期\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'mcgeever专栏大型银行债券交易低迷遥遥无绝期\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLifestyle News\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'entertainment\\', \\'saunders\\', \\'romans\\', \\'prize\\', \\'returns\\', \\'potter\\', \\'lifestyle\\', \\'romes\\', \\'lincoln\\', \\'london\\', \\'man\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nRecent Lifestyle NewsWith the crazy \\'Italics\\', Asterix returns for 37th adventure PARIS Asterix, the indomitable pint-sized Gaul forever outfoxing the Romans, returns for his 37th comic adventure on Thursday, this time battling his way across Italy in a chariot race.\\n| Entertainment, ItalyGeorge Saunders\\' \\'Lincoln in the Bardo\\' wins 2017 Man Booker prize LONDON American author George Saunders has won the 2017 Man Booker Prize, a high-profile literary award, for his first novel, \"Lincoln in the Bardo,\" -

She declined to discuss Trump’s views on the ethnicity of political appointees.\\n\\nOne day before Trump took office on Jan. 20, his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet’s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.\\n\\n“People (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration,” he told reporters.\\n\\nThe mid-level political positions, known as “Schedule C” and “non-career SES” posts, numbered 1,051 in June, according to most recent data published in late September.\\n\\nU.S. President Donald Trump is surrounded by his cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (L-R), Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Linda McMahon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tom Price, as he signs an executive order entitled \"Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch\" in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2017.

The mid-level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations.\\n\\nIn recent decades, such jobs would account for about half of some 4,000 positions that get filled anew with every change of administration.

Bush. Between 2006-2008, the only Bush years covered by OPM gender, race and ethnicity data, men made up 60 percent of mid-level staff and 88 percent described themselves as non-Hispanic white.\\n\\nHowever, the United States has become more diverse over the past decade, making the numbers for this administration less representative of America’s demographic makeup than was the case under Bush.\\n\\nIn 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population. Now that share is 4 percentage points lower, U.S. Census figures show.\\n\\nAmong Republican registered voters, the share of those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white has edged down from 88 percent in 2008 to 86 percent just before the 2016 presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.\\n\\nWomen also have a larger share of overall U.S. jobs than during the Bush years. Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008.

It faces a $40 million deficit this year as it struggles with fewer privately insured patients, cuts in government reimbursement and higher labor costs to attract a shrinking pool of nurses.\\n\\nTo keep its operations intact, Charleston Medical is spending this year $12 million on visiting or “travel” nurses, twice as much as three years ago. It had no need for travel nurses a decade ago.\\n\\n“I’ve been a nurse 40 years, and the shortage is the worst I’ve ever seen it,” said Ron Moore, who retired in October from his position as vice president and chief nursing officer for the center. Charleston Area Medical’s incentives include tuition reimbursement for nursing students who commit to work at the hospital for two years.\\n\\n“It’s better to pay a traveler than to shut a bed,” he said.\\n\\nHospitals nationwide face tough choices when it comes to filling nursing jobs. They are paying billions of dollars collectively to recruit and retain nurses rather than risk patient safety or closing down departments, according to Reuters interviews with more than 20 hospitals, including some of the largest U.S. chains.\\n\\nIn addition to higher salaries, retention and signing bonuses, they now offer perks such as student loan repayment, free housing and career mentoring, and rely more on foreign or temporary nurses to fill the gaps.\\n\\nThe cost nationwide for travel nurses alone nearly doubled over three years to $4.8 billion in 2017, according to Staffing Industry Analysts, a global advisor on workforce issues.\\n\\nThe burden falls disproportionately on hospitals serving rural communities, many of them already straining under heavy debt like the Charleston Area Medical Center.\\n\\nThese hospitals must offer more money and benefits to compete with facilities in larger metropolitan areas, many of them linked to well-funded universities, interviews with hospital officials and health experts show.\\n\\nAlong West Virginia’s border with Pennsylvania, university-affiliated J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown is spending $10.4 million in 2017 compared with $3.6 million a year earlier to hire and retain nurses.\\n\\nBut these costs are part of the facility’s expansion this year, including adding more than 100 beds as it grows programs and takes over healthcare services from smaller rural providers that have scaled back or closed.\\n\\nJ.W. Ruby, the flagship hospital for WVU Medicine, offers higher pay for certain shifts, tuition reimbursement, $10,000 signing bonuses and free housing for staff who live at least 60 miles away.\\n\\nNext year, the hospital is considering paying college tuition for the family members of long-time nurses to keep them in West Virginia.\\n\\n“We’ll do whatever we need to do,” said Doug Mitchell, vice president and chief nursing officer of WVU Medicine-WVU Hospitals.\\n\\nNOT LIKE OTHER SHORTAGES\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Job seekers listen to a recruiter at the Colorado Hospital Association job fair in Denver, Colorado, U.S. on October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo\\n\\nNursing shortages have occurred in the past, but the current crisis is far worse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there will be more than a million registered nurse openings by 2024, twice the rate seen in previous shortages.\\n\\nA major driver is the aging of the baby boomer generation, with a greater number of patients seeking care, including many more complex cases, and a new wave of retirements among trained nurses.\\n\\nIndustry experts, from hospital associations to Wall Street analysts, say the crisis is harder to address than in the past. A faculty shortage and too few nursing school slots has contributed to the problem.\\n\\nHospitals seek to meet a goal calling for 80 percent of nursing staff to have a four-year degree by 2020, up from 50 percent in 2010. They also face more competition with clinics and insurance companies that may offer more flexible hours.\\n\\nHealthcare experts warn that the shortfall presents risks to patients and providers. Research published in August in the International Journal of Nursing Studies found that having inadequate numbers of registered nurses on staff made it more likely that a patient would die after common surgeries.\\n\\nUAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, has invested millions to attract nurses, but still has 300 jobs to fill. At times, nursing vacancy rates in some of its departments has hit 20 percent or higher.\\n\\nSlideshow (7 Images)\\n\\n“We’ve rarely canceled a surgery or closed a bed because of lack of staffing,” said Terri Poe, chief of nursing at the hospital, the state’s largest, which serves many low income and uninsured residents.\\n\\nLast year, the medical center covered nearly $200 million in unreimbursed medical costs for patients. It spent $4.5 million for visiting nurses during fiscal 2016, including $3 million for post-surgery services, compared with $858,000 in 2012.\\n\\nHealthcare labor costs typically account for at least half of a facility’s expenses. They jumped by 7.6 percent nationally last year, after climbing at a rate closer to 5 percent annually in recent years, said Beth Wexler, vice president non-profit healthcare at Moody‘s. The spending has proven a boon for medical staffing companies like AMN Healthcare and Aya Healthcare.\\n\\nMissouri’s nursing shortage reached a record high in 2017, with almost 16 percent - or 5,700 - of positions vacant, up from 8 percent last year. Thirty-four percent of Missouri registered nurses are 55 or older.\\n\\n“Our biggest challenge is getting the pipeline of experienced nurses,” said Peter Callan, director of talent acquisition and development at the University of Missouri Health Care in Columbia, which is expanding. “There are fewer and fewer as people retire.”\\n\\nLast year, the academic medical center hired talent scouts to identify candidates, Callan said. It spends $750,000 a year on extras to attract and keep nurses, including annual $2,000 bonuses to registered nurses who remain in hard-to-fill units and up to five years of student loan repayment assistance. It offers employee referral bonuses and a chance to win a trip to Hawaii.\\n\\nSmaller hospitals find it much harder to compete in this climate. More than 40 percent of rural hospitals had negative operating margins in 2015, according to The Chartis Center for Rural Health.\\n\\nIn rural Missouri, 25-bed Ste. Genevieve County Memorial Hospital had to offer signing bonuses, tuition reimbursement and pay differentials when staffing is “critically low” in units such as obstetrics.\\n\\nThey haven’t closed beds, but have hired less experienced nurses, raised salaries and turned away at least one patient who would have been in its long term care program.\\n\\n“We’ve had to try whatever it takes to get nurses here,” said Rita Brumfield, head of nursing at the hospital. “It’s a struggle every day to get qualified staff.”\\n\\nTo see the entire graphic on the U.S. nursing shortage, click tmsnrt.rs/2xQ9Y0K\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBreakingviews - Hadas: Time to slay the free market-myth monster\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'breakingviews\\', \\'hadas\\', \\'slay\\', \\'work\\', \\'private\\', \\'governments\\', \\'nonprivate\\', \\'economy\\', \\'marketmyth\\', \\'free\\', \\'public\\', \\'monster\\', \\'markets\\', \\'good\\', \\'sector\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Free markets sound like such a good idea.\\nREUTERS/Bor Slana (SLOVENIA - Tags: ANNIVERSARY SOCIETY) - GM1E6C20EI001This story of private sector freedom and state sector sloth is often told.\\nThe pairing of good free markets and bad governments should be evaluated by the standard of what is actually happening.\\nSecond, free markets sometimes subvert that common good.\\nThe private sector is even less interested.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Free markets sound like such a good idea. They offer choice and opportunities, which are good things. And who does not want freedom? Besides, if the alternative to these markets is the impassive, incompetent bureaucratic state, then the policy path is obvious. Let markets go free and peg back governments, so their only role in the productive economy is to deal with the occasional failure of markets to work as they should.\\n\\nActors dressed as devils perform during the \"gathering of the devils\" ahead of Saint Nicholas Day in Podkoren December 1, 2010.

REUTERS/Bor Slana (SLOVENIA - Tags: ANNIVERSARY SOCIETY) - GM1E6C20EI001\\n\\nThis story of private sector freedom and state sector sloth is often told. In the United States, profit-hungry entrepreneurs are considered economic heroes. Even in more social democratic Europe, few politicians or commentators publicly doubt that the profit motive is almost always the best way to get things done.\\n\\nAs with all good myths, there is a thin tie to reality. The Soviet Union showed that economies stagnate without private enterprise. However, communist Russia is long gone. The pairing of good free markets and bad governments should be evaluated by the standard of what is actually happening. By that measure, the story makes no sense, for four reasons.\\n\\nFirst, markets and governments are not enemies. Markets are created and sustained by law and they thrive in well-governed societies. Complex modern economies cannot thrive without extensive regulation, and only governments can ensure that rules actually serve the common good.\\n\\nSecond, free markets sometimes subvert that common good. Take the pharmaceutical industry. It certainly produces many useful products, but the search for ever higher profits has led too many companies to focus on drugs which patients have to take for many years, rather than on antibiotics, which cure quickly and usually cheaply. In the United States, the industry’s blind dedication to profits has contributed to the wild over-prescription of opioid painkillers, helping to spawn a public health crisis.\\n\\nThird, the private-public split is too simple. Many important institutions are neither one nor the other. In healthcare, education, scientific research and public infrastructure, much of the work may ultimately be under government control, but the leading organisations are mostly self-perpetuating and self-governing bodies. Mostly they serve the common good fairly well.\\n\\nFinally, not-for-profit organisations have advantages over market players. Taxpayers and donors can fund projects which are too risky for private investors. Organisations with a public responsibility can work on socially useful projects which will never generate a big cash profit. These attributes give the government a much wider remit than just resolving market failures.\\n\\nThe free market myth will not go away on its own. It needs to be replaced. One potential substitute, the old narrative of the social market or social democracy, has lost its appeal. Perhaps voters should be grateful that the mixed economy has given them the highest level of prosperity and economic security ever seen. They are not thankful. On the contrary, they are increasingly tempted by populist narratives which condemn, among other things, stultifying government bureaucracy.\\n\\nIt is true that many government agencies have lost their way. All institutions tend to become rigid over time, but governments have an additional problem with morale. It’s hard to be imaginative and energetic when you’re frequently told that your only job is to pick up the messes left by the generally much more competent private sector.\\n\\nThe free-market answer to all problems is to shrink the government, but that would only make everything worse. The modern economy is a shared project which cannot work well without a vibrant non-private sector. If that sector is tired and beaten down, it needs to be encouraged and revived. University College London (UCL), itself a pretty vibrant non-private institution, has launched a project with exactly that goal. The Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose is run by economist Mariana Mazzucato. Her book “The Entrepreneurial State”, a defence of the contributions and potential of government in the modern economy, inspires the IIPP’s motto: entrepreneurial societies need entrepreneurial states.\\n\\nMazzucato has gathered an impressive selection of big names in the non-private economy on the IIPP’s advisory board, from James Galbraith, who teaches about the economic role of government at the University of Texas, to Mike Bracken, who led the successful effort to create user-friendly websites for the British government.\\n\\nBut the names on the board – and the chat at last week’s launch party in London – also show how much work remains to be done. Almost all the people listening enthusiastically to the narrative of the central role of the non-private sector were already well ensconced in that part of the economy.\\n\\nTo get past preaching to the converted, the new story has to persuade politicians. There are few signs of that happening. The private sector is even less interested. Shareholder value is still the norm and government is still generally treated as either an enemy or a tool to be manipulated in the fight for competitive advantage. Old myths are hard to kill.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nألمانيا تنتظر انتهاء تحقيقات إسرائيل في فضيحة فساد قبل تسليمها غواصات\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'قبل\\', \\'تنتظر\\', \\'millions\\', \\'تحقيقات\\', \\'فساد\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'في\\', \\'فضيحة\\', \\'massive\\', \\'انتهاء\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'تسليمها\\', \\'إسرائيل\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'غواصات\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nU.S. drone strike kills militant whose group killed 250 in Pakistan\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'group\\', \\'pakistan\\', \\'jua\\', \\'kills\\', \\'killed\\', \\'khorasani\\', \\'afghanistan\\', \\'250\\', \\'state\\', \\'taliban\\', \\'strike\\', \\'islamic\\', \\'militant\\', \\'pakistani\\', \\'drone\\', \\'wounded\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nDERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - The leader of a Pakistani militant group whose suicide bombings killed more than 250 people died on Thursday of injuries from a U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan, a spokesman for the militants said.\\nHe later joined the Pakistani Taliban in 2007 to fight the government to establish strict sharia Islamic law.\\nJuA gained attention in September 2014 when it announced it was supporting Islamic State and rejecting the main Pakistani Taliban leadership.\\nBy March 2015, however, the group was again swearing loyalty to the main Pakistani Taliban umbrella leadership.\\nStill, JuA never specifically disavowed Islamic State either, and several attacks inside Pakistan have been claimed by both groups.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nDERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - The leader of a Pakistani militant group whose suicide bombings killed more than 250 people died on Thursday of injuries from a U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan, a spokesman for the militants said.\\n\\nOmar Khalid Khorasani’s death comes ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit and is likely to help ease tensions between the often-wary allies, as Islamabad has been asking Washington to target militants who attack inside Pakistan and hide over the border in Afghanistan.\\n\\nKhorasani’s Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, is one of dozens of armed Islamist factions - including al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban - operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\n\\nBut JuA has been particularly deadly in Pakistan, claiming responsibility for eight major attacks in two years.\\n\\nAmong them was last year’s Easter Sunday bombing in a park that killed at least 70 people, including 29 children, in the eastern city of Lahore.\\n\\nThe group also said it carried out a suicide attack at a hospital that killed at least 74 people in the southwestern city of Quetta, a bombing also claimed by Islamic State, with which JuA also has been affiliated.\\n\\nRumours had flown for two days that Khorasani had been wounded in U.S. drone strikes along the Afghan-Pakistani border, and on Thursday his group confirmed he had died.\\n\\n“Our leader, Omar Khalid Khorasani, was wounded in one of the recent drone strikes in Afghanistan. He was wounded badly, and today he was martyred,” JuA spokesman Asad Mansur said by telephone.\\n\\nThe announcement came a week after Pakistan’s army rescued a kidnapped American couple and their three children from the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban faction that Washington has long accused Islamabad of failing to target.\\n\\nThe killing of Khorasani is likely to add to the recently improved mood between Washington and Islamabad, said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and prominent political analyst.\\n\\n“He was a very powerful leader and he had done great harm to Pakistan,” Masood said of Khorasani. “I think Pakistan has been looking forward to this, and I think the Americans targeting him has been very helpful in that sense.”\\n\\nKhorasani had a background that reads like a history of Pakistani militancy.\\n\\nBorn Abdul Wali in a village called Lakaro in the northwestern Mohmand tribal region, Khorasani started out as an anti-India jihadist fighting in Kashmir, according to a long-time friend who spoke last year to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nHe later joined the Pakistani Taliban in 2007 to fight the government to establish strict sharia Islamic law.\\n\\nIn 2014, Khorasani left the Pakistani Taliban after a leadership quarrel to form Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.\\n\\nJuA gained attention in September 2014 when it announced it was supporting Islamic State and rejecting the main Pakistani Taliban leadership.\\n\\nBy March 2015, however, the group was again swearing loyalty to the main Pakistani Taliban umbrella leadership.\\n\\nStill, JuA never specifically disavowed Islamic State either, and several attacks inside Pakistan have been claimed by both groups.\\n\\nThe United States last year designated JuA as a terrorist group.\\n\\nKhorasani had previously been seriously wounded in a NATO air strike in eastern Afghanistan in 2015 but later recovered.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nVenus secures Muguruza rematch at WTA Finals\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'wta\\', \\'group\\', \\'pool\\', \\'pliskova\\', \\'muguruza\\', \\'wimbledon\\', \\'rematch\\', \\'venus\\', \\'finals\\', \\'garcia\\', \\'secures\\', \\'final\\', \\'williams\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Venus Williams will get an opportunity to avenge her Wimbledon final defeat by Garbine Muguruza at the eight-player WTA Finals after the veteran American was placed in the same round-robin group as the Spaniard at Friday’s draw.\\nFILE PHOTO: Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 15, 2017 Venus Williams of the U.S. poses with the runner up trophy after losing the final against Spain’s Garbine Muguruza.\\nThe power-packed pool, full of aggressive players armed with big serves, will open proceedings on Sunday when Pliskova faces 2008 WTA Finals champion Williams, before Muguruza takes on Latvia’s Ostapenko at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\\nThe round-robin format will see the top two players from each pool advance to the semi-finals.\\nTournament previewDraw:Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 15, 2017 Spain’s Garbine Muguruza poses with the trophy as she celebrates winning the final against Venus Williams of the U.S. REUTERS/David Ramos/PoolRed Group (prefix denotes seeding)1-Simona Halep (Romania)4-Elina Svitolina (Ukraine)6-Caroline Wozniacki (Denmark)8-Caroline Garcia (France)White Group2-Garbine Muguruza (Spain)3-Karolina Pliskova (Czech Republic)5-Venus Williams (United States)7-Jelena Ostapenko (Latvia)\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Venus Williams will get an opportunity to avenge her Wimbledon final defeat by Garbine Muguruza at the eight-player WTA Finals after the veteran American was placed in the same round-robin group as the Spaniard at Friday’s draw.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 15, 2017 Venus Williams of the U.S. poses with the runner up trophy after losing the final against Spain’s Garbine Muguruza.

They are reducing screen time, blocking Facebook and restricting access. But in Advait Chandan’s “Secret Superstar”, the problem is the solution.\\n\\nHandout photo from the film “Secret Superstar”.\\n\\nThe internet offers heroine Insiya an escape route from a stifling life. The shadow of an abusive father and the domestic violence she sees every day loom over her. What keeps her going is her love for music - and her mother Najma. For all her submissive behaviour in front of her husband, Najma is a feisty woman - she fights for her daughter to have the freedom she herself never had. She lets Insiya go out with boys, pursue her music, and buys her a laptop with an internet connection.\\n\\nInsiya might live in Vadodara, not one of India’s biggest cities, but the internet is a great leveller. She records a few videos on YouTube wearing a burqa - fearing her father will find out - and in the magical ways of Bollywood, turns into an internet sensation overnight. She has millions of page views, fan pages waiting for her posts, but at home, none of that matters because her father can wreak havoc at any time.\\n\\nTo his credit, director Chandan doesn’t shy away from depicting domestic violence. There are scenes that are difficult to watch and the reality of domestic abuse and its effects on children are portrayed with more sensitivity and realism than usual for a Bollywood film. The bond between Najma and Insiya is also one of the film’s highlights, as is the track between Insiya and Chintan (Tirth Sharma), her classmate who harbours a very obvious crush on her.\\n\\nThe problem with “Secret Superstar” is that it starts out with a good idea, but the film unravels because it wants to say too many things at once. Chandan seems determined that audiences should cry at every turn. Insiya and her journey to stardom are full of contrivances. Chandan isn’t bothered about authenticity or logic - he just wants to make sure those tears are flowing.\\n\\nAamir Khan appears as Shakti Kumarr, the rather obnoxious and self-obsessed music director who turns into an unlikely saviour for Insiya, but this film is not about him. It is about Insiya, and Zaira Wasim puts in an inspired performance that rides over the several bumps in the script. She shares a wonderful chemistry with Meher Vij, who plays Najma, and the two of them are the life of “Secret Superstar”. If only the film had shown as much restraint as they do, it might have been more deserving of “superstar” status.\\n\\n(The views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.

It had also said the problem was mainly with aluminium and copper products.\\n\\nKobe Steel has an extensive role in global supply chains - the company produces engine valve springs found in half the world’s cars, according to its website.\\n\\nKobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara said the company had found a breach of industrial standards at its Hatano copper plant southwest of Tokyo, along with a new case of falsification of data at a unit that cuts and processes steel plate.\\n\\n”There has been also some impact on our business as we have lost credibility,” Umehara told a news conference, citing cases that the company lost orders and customers switched to its competitors. “But we can’t quantify the impact at the moment.”\\n\\nHe said the Hatano plant did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards for quality management after it faked data on tensile strength and other properties of copper and copper-alloy piping.\\n\\nKobe Steel has stopped shipping about 43 percent of copper products from the plant over the problems with the statutory standards, a company spokeswoman said.\\n\\nTwo certification companies said on Thursday they were investigating whether the plant is in line with a global standard on quality control.\\n\\nThey could suspend or cancel the “ISO9001” certification of the plant if it doesn’t meet the standard, which could affect its business as many global buyers require suppliers to use the benchmark.\\n\\nKobe Steel said it also found, as the result of a whistleblower, that a plant in western Japan had been ”obstructing company’s voluntary inspection” by concealing data.\\n\\nAfter getting a tip that workers at the Chofu plant failed to report data falsification on aluminium extrusion products, the company decided to set up a panel of outsiders, replacing an in-house panel led by the company’s president.\\n\\nKobe Steel Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara attends a news conference in Tokyo, Japan October 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato\\n\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry believes “the data concealment by its employees has hurt the credibility of Kobe Steel’s voluntary investigation,” said Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division.\\n\\nThe ministry ordered the company on Friday to expedite its probes and report results as soon as possible.\\n\\nKobe Steel previously said that it found widespread falsification of data on the strength and durability of copper and aluminium products sent to customers. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.\\n\\nJUSTICE PROBE\\n\\nSlideshow (6 Images)\\n\\nGlobal automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products because of the falsification, although four Japanese carmakers said on Thursday they have found no safety issues with aluminium parts supplied by Kobe Steel.\\n\\nThe company is now subject to a U.S. Justice Department probe while checks continue at hundreds of its clients involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.\\n\\nNo safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. But in Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.\\n\\n“We are worried about the U.S. Justice Department probe,” said a source at one of the company’s lenders. “The impact will be very big if the DOJ seeks a criminal case against Kobe and hits it with huge financial penalties.”\\n\\nThe company has started selling assets to raise fund, on Friday holding the first round of an auction to sell its most of a property unit, sources told Reuters on Friday, a deal that reportedly could raise over $400 million.\\n\\nKobe Steel’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out.\\n\\nKobe Steel shares fell 1.6 percent on Friday.

REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani/File Photo\\n\\nIn defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran’s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region.\\n\\nA senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was “acting crazy” and was following U.S. strategy of increasing “the shadow of war in the region”.\\n\\nIran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.\\n\\n“In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.\\n\\n“The IRGC can’t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don’t back down.”\\n\\nThe day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards’ al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq’s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum.\\n\\nThe niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month.\\n\\nOther Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.\\n\\n“I don’t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,” she said. “He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.”\\n\\nLIGHTNING ASSAULT\\n\\nWithin days, Iran’s mostly Shi‘ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran’s hand in Iraq.\\n\\nCommanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi‘ite-led Iraqi central government’s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied.\\n\\nA video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi‘ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office.\\n\\nIran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism.\\n\\nAfter the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran.\\n\\nFRONT-LINE PLAYER\\n\\nRegional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi‘ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.\\n\\n“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,” said Khamenei. “Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.”\\n\\nSpeaking after Trump’s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: ”From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...\\n\\n“Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.”\\n\\nThe ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months.\\n\\nSmall boats from the Revolutionary Guards’ navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares.\\n\\nIn August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official.\\n\\nSome recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually.\\n\\nDuring the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL FLASHPOINT\\n\\nThe Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi‘ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.\\n\\n“The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi‘ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards.\\n\\nIn early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.\\n\\n“This is the first time that we’ve seen it used in this area,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack.\\n\\nDozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military.\\n\\nAsked about the threat posed by Shi‘ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump’s speech, Dillon said: “We’re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.”\\n\\nTrump’s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards’ political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet.\\n\\nSince becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards’ economic influence and involvement in political matters.\\n\\nNow, Rouhani’s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump’s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. “What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,” said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n中移动首三季净利同比增4.6% 受通信服务收入增加带动\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'millions\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'受通信服务收入增加带动\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'中移动首三季净利同比增46\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n中国当局聘请花旗、汇丰等10家银行办理发行20亿美元主权债\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'中国当局聘请花旗汇丰等10家银行办理发行20亿美元主权债\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nUEFA open disciplinary proceedings against Everton\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'olympique\\', \\'league\\', \\'disciplinary\\', \\'lyon\\', \\'uefa\\', \\'everton\\', \\'europa\\', \\'players\\', \\'situation\\', \\'proceedings\\', \\'open\\', \\'frustration\\', \\'williams\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) -

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\\n\\nDie Republikaner stellten in der von ihnen kontrollierten Kongresskammer in der Nacht zum Freitag die Weichen für eine vereinfachte Abstimmung über eines der zentralen Prestigevorhaben Trumps. Sie nahmen einen Haushaltsentwurf an, der neben einer billionenschweren Extra-Belastung des Staatsetats ein Instrument beinhaltet, das es ihnen ermöglichen würde, auch ohne Unterstützung der oppositionellen Demokraten die Steuerpläne durch die Kammer zu bringen. Trump sprach auf Twitter vom “ersten Schritt” hin zu “massiven Steuererleichterungen für das amerikanische Volk”. Die Finanzmärkte reagierten positiv. Sowohl in Asien als auch in Europa verbuchten die Börsen Gewinne. Scharfe Kritik kam dagegen von der Opposition.\\n\\nDer Senat stimmte mit 51 zu 49 dafür, grünes Licht für eine zusätzliche Belastung des Bundeshaushalts um bis zu 1,5 Billionen Dollar binnen zehn Jahren zu geben. So sollen die von der Regierung versprochenen Steuersenkungen für Unternehmen und Privatpersonen im Volumen von bis zu sechs Billionen Dollar mitfinanziert werden können. Der Entwurf sieht außerdem eine Art Schlichtungsverfahren vor, das die Chancen erhöhen würde, Trumps Steuerreform durch den Senat zu bekommen. Denn bei der Abstimmung über die Steuergesetzgebung würde dann bereits eine einfach Mehrheit reichen. Normalerweise wären dafür mindestens 60 der 100 Stimmen im Senat nötig. Die Republikaner verfügen aber nur über 52 Stimmen - und bei Demokraten stoßen die Steuerpläne in ihrer jetzigen Form auf wenig Gegenliebe. Nach ihrer Auffassung profitieren in erster Linie Konzerne und Superreiche von den Erleichterungen. Für Teile der Mittelschicht würden die Steuern sogar steigen, und das Staatsdefizit würde ebenfalls höher ausfallen, sagte Senator Ron Wyden, der Spitzenvertreter der Demokraten im Finanzausschuss der Kammer.\\n\\nTRUMP NACH OBAMACARE-DEBAKEL UNTER ERFOLGSDRUCK\\n\\nBevor allerdings überhaupt über eine komplette Steuerreform abgestimmt werden kann, muss der Entwurf des Senats mit dem bereits verabschiedeten Gegenstück der anderen Kongresskammer, dem Repräsentantenhaus, in Einklang gebracht werden. Dessen Version fällt in mehreren Punkten anders aus. So streben die Abgeordneten ein Nullsummen-Spiel an, bei dem der Haushalt nicht zusätzlich belastet würde. Steuersenkungen sollen begleitet werden von erheblichen Ausgabekürzungen im sozialen Bereich, etwa bei der Hilfe für Arme.\\n\\nTrump und seine Partei stehen erheblich unter Druck, endlich eines der zentralen Wahlversprechen von 2016 umzusetzen, nachdem sie mit dem Versuch, die Gesundheitsreform von Trumps Vorgänger Barack Obama zu kippen, gescheitert sind. Der Präsident feierte denn auch das Abstimmungsergebnis im Senat als “großartige News”. Der Mehrheitsführer der Republikaner im Senat, Mitch McConnell, sagte, mit diesem Etat-Entwurf sei man auf dem Weg, Familien und Einzelpersonen zu entlasten. Der parteipolitisch unabhängige Senator Bernie Sanders, der sich im vergangenen Jahr um die Präsidentschaftskandidatur der Demokraten beworben hatte, sagte dagegen, der Haushaltsentwurf sei erschreckend. In Zeiten, in denen die Einkommen massiv ungleich verteilt seien, liefere dieser Haushalt 1,9 Billionen Dollar Steuererleichterungen für das reichste Prozent der Bevölkerung.\\n\\nAn den Börsen ließ die Bewegung bei dem Steuervorhaben Hoffnungen auf einen US-Wirtschaftsboom aufflammen. Analyst Neil Wilson vom Brokerhaus ETX Capital sprach von einem großen Schritt in Richtung Steuersenkungen. Dax und EuroStoxx stiegen bis Freitagmittag in der Spitze um jeweils etwa ein halbes Prozent auf 13.063 und 3617 Punkte.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n香港首度取代上海成亚洲最奢侈城市 受楼价推高--瑞士宝盛\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'香港首度取代上海成亚洲最奢侈城市\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'受楼价推高瑞士宝盛\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nNouvelle passe d\\'armes sur l\\'ISF à l\\'Assemblée\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'par\\', \\'lassemblée\\', \\'à\\', \\'darmes\\', \\'le\\', \\'et\\', \\'lisf\\', \\'les\\', \\'qui\\', \\'passe\\', \\'nouvelle\\', \\'la\\', \\'des\\', \\'sur\\', \\'en\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBruno Le Maire a fourni vendredi de nouveaux éléments aux députés réclamant des précisions sur l\\'impact pour les Français les plus aisés des mesures fiscales prévues dans le budget 2018, répondant aux critiques de la gauche en haussant le ton sur la politique fiscale menée par la précédente majorité.\\n/Photo prise le 3 octobre 2017/REUTERS/Benoit Tessier“Les 100 premiers contributeurs à l‘ISF paient 126 millions d‘euros, les 100 premiers patrimoines paient 73 millions d‘euros d‘ISF”, a déclaré le ministre de l‘Economie et des Finances pendant le débat sur le projet de loi de finances (PLF) 2018 à l‘Assemblée nationale.\\nL‘opposition a jugé que ces précisions ne répondaient que partiellement à sa demande d‘explications, faute d‘éléments concernant l‘impact du prélèvement forfaitaire unique (PFU) -

The storm left the entire island without power. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\\n\\nThe storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.\\n\\nWe know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.\\n\\nWe need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nJarrett Blanc: Trump\\'s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe\\n\\nPeter Apps: Uber\\'s London fight a sign of tech battles to come\\n\\nThe centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.\\n\\nThat’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.\\n\\nIn Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.\\n\\nWorkers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez\\n\\nThe result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?\\n\\nNot quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.\\n\\nIn Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.\\n\\nOther initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.\\n\\nDebris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\\n\\nTackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.\\n\\nUtilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.\\n\\nThe fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.\\n\\nDiesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.\\n\\nSo what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.\\n\\nNow, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTech, bank stocks lift Wall Street; tax-cut plan back in focus\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'street\\', \\'wall\\', \\'lift\\', \\'focus\\', \\'week\\', \\'sp\\', \\'tech\\', \\'points\\', \\'nasdaq\\', \\'500\\', \\'technology\\', \\'york\\', \\'stocks\\', \\'taxcut\\', \\'bank\\', \\'companies\\', \\'plan\\', \\'way\\', \\'earnings\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Technology and bank stocks lifted Wall Street on Friday and investor optimism received a fresh boost from Washington, where the Trump administration inched a step closer to implementing tax-cut plan.\\nFILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is pictured in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2017.\\nHopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.\\nSo far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.\\nPayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Technology and bank stocks lifted Wall Street on Friday and investor optimism received a fresh boost from Washington, where the Trump administration inched a step closer to implementing tax-cut plan.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is pictured in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2017.

The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.\\n\\nThere are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term.

That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.\\n\\nIn April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.\\n\\nSolar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.\\n\\nThe residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.\\n\\nNevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually.

Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.\\n\\nA man shouts slogans against the Spanish police outside the national police station in Barcelona on Oct. 2, the day after hundreds were injured when police tried to stop a Catalonia independence referendum that the Spanish government had ruled illegal. REUTERS/Eloy Alonso\\n\\nIronically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.\\n\\nThe scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nJohn Lloyd: Europe\\'s war of the nationalists picks up steam\\n\\nJulie McNamara: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico\\'s post-hurricane misery\\n\\nCatalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.\\n\\nA Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.\\n\\nSpanish Civil Guard officers in Sant Julia de Ramis disperse people outside a polling station for the Catalonia independence referendum, October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea\\n\\nEvents in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.\\n\\nIn France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.\\n\\nSo far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.\\n\\nSpain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.\\n\\nAlready, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.\\n\\nRajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.\\n\\nThe most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nFTSE closes flat as sterling bounces back on Brexit hopes\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'week\\', \\'won\\', \\'ftse\\', \\'closes\\', \\'london\\', \\'earlier\\', \\'results\\', \\'hopes\\', \\'100\\', \\'sterling\\', \\'weekly\\', \\'bounces\\', \\'flat\\', \\'earnings\\', \\'weak\\', \\'brexit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - The FTSE closed up 0.2 percent on Friday as sterling bounced back on hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations, and consumer heavyweights Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser weighed down an index that was earlier lifted by financials.\\nA worker shelters from the rain under a Union Flag umbrella as he passes the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain, October 1, 2008.\\nUnilever (ULVR.L) and Reckitt (RB.L) were among the leading decliners after weak results earlier this week, closing down 3.2 and 2.7 percent respectively.\\nMiner Fresnillo (FRES.L) was the top FTSE 100 loser, closing 3.6 percent lower, after a downgrade to “neutral” from top-ranked Credit Suisse analyst Ivano Westin on the grounds that it was now well-priced.\\nOverall analysts have downgraded their earnings expectations for the FTSE 100 into third-quarter results as a boost from sterling’s depreciation fades.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - The FTSE closed up 0.2 percent on Friday as sterling bounced back on hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations, and consumer heavyweights Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser weighed down an index that was earlier lifted by financials.\\n\\nA worker shelters from the rain under a Union Flag umbrella as he passes the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain, October 1, 2008.

It holds all of the funds raised, which have mushroomed to more than $400 million in value because the contributions were made in two cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – that have appreciated sharply. But the Breitmans, who still control the Tezos source code through a Delaware company, are seeking to oust the head of the foundation.\\n\\nAn attorney for the Breitmans sent a 46-page letter on Sunday to the two other members of the foundation’s three-person board, calling for Gevers’ prompt removal and seeking to give the couple a “substantial role” in a new structure that would limit the foundation’s responsibilities. The document accuses Gevers of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.” According to Gevers, the two board members later suggested via email that he step aside for a month while they investigate.\\n\\nGevers told Reuters he is not stepping down. “As Arthur has done to others before me,” Gevers said, “this is attempted character assassination. It’s a long laundry list of misleading statements and outright lies.” He said the other two board members “are attempting an illegal coup.”\\n\\nThe Breitmans have been trying to control the foundation as if it were their own private entity, Gevers said, by bypassing the foundation’s legal structure and interfering with management and operations. This has resulted in costly delays in developing and launching the Tezos network and new currency, he said.\\n\\n“They’re unnecessarily putting the project at risk,” he said.\\n\\nIn a written statement sent to Reuters, the Breitmans reiterated their accusations against Gevers and said they acted “in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.” They said their priority “remains the successful launch of the Tezos network.”\\n\\nHundreds of millions of dollars are at stake: The Tezos digital coins, called “Tezzies,” are already priced at a hefty premium in futures trading even though they don’t yet exist. The launching of the Tezos network, which will trigger the coins’ release, has been delayed. Until the network launches – and no date is set – contributors to the fundraiser will receive nothing.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the Tezos coin offering, there’s no guarantee participants will ever receive a single Tez. Participants agreed to accept the risk that the project “may be abandoned.” Despite the feud, Gevers said he remains committed to resolving the feud so that “this project succeeds.”\\n\\nThe tale of how two young entrepreneurs raised a fortune for a project barely out of the starting blocks is reported here in detail for the first time. It highlights the risks inherent in the current frenzy for ICOs, in which tech startups issue new cryptocurrencies to raise capital.\\n\\nReuters reported last month that cryptocurrency exchanges – where virtual currencies are bought, sold and stored – have become magnets for fraud and deception. More than 980,000 bitcoins – the most popular virtual currency – have been stolen since 2011. Today they would be worth about $5 billion.\\n\\nSimilar large sums are pouring into initial coin offerings. From January through September, ICOs generated $2.2 billion, more than three times the amount invested in similar startups by traditional venture capital firms, according to Novum Insights, a data provider.\\n\\nICOs can be a way for technology projects to raise money online to finance the development of new, open-source computer networks that aren’t necessarily looking to make a profit. Contributors receive new digital coins, or tokens, which they typically need to “pay” to access the new networks.\\n\\nBut the recent flurry of ICOs raising millions of dollars has attracted some dubious business propositions and outright scams, as well as speculators looking to trade the coins for swift gains. Authorities in the United States, Switzerland, China, Singapore and other nations have begun scrutinizing the sector closely for potentially tougher regulation.\\n\\n“Most ICOs are bought by people looking to ‘flip’ their tokens to a greater fool for a quick profit,” said Alistair Milne, a co-founder of the London-based Altana Digital Currency Fund, which so far has avoided ICOs. More than “90 percent will fall to have a near-zero value in time,” he predicted.\\n\\nThe new cryptocurrencies function through a technology called blockchain, essentially a public ledger maintained by a network of computers. Blockchain applications are being tested by financial services firms, food suppliers, retailers and other businesses as a way to make record-keeping simpler and cheaper. Tezos aims to be a blockchain that’s more reliable than the ones behind bitcoin and ether. Several entrepreneurs and investors in the blockchain industry said the Tezos technology has potential because it would be easier to upgrade and may be more secure than other blockchains.\\n\\nANARCHO-CAPITALISM\\n\\nThe son of Jean-Claude Deret, a French playwright and actor, Arthur Breitman studied applied mathematics, computer science and physics in France, before moving to the United States and studying financial mathematics at New York University. He went on to work for the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nHe is still listed as a co-organizer and “dear leader” for the New York Anarcho-Capitalist Meetup in New York, which describes its philosophy as “a type of radical libertarianism that favors the abundant wealth production, rapid technological development, and high standards of living produced by capitalism.” Its website adds, “We are also fairly lazy about fighting the state.”\\n\\nIt was at a crypto-anarchist lunch in 2010 that Breitman first met Kathleen McCaffrey, an American college student from New Jersey. She is described on a political blog called The Politicizer as a libertarian Republican who first became interested in politics after listening to the provocative radio personality Rush Limbaugh at the age of five. She married Breitman in 2013.\\n\\nKathleen Breitman, now 27, later worked at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and at R3, a blockchain company. In a July post on the conservative website legalinsurrection.com, she said she “didn’t get along” at the hedge fund but had “a great time” at R3.\\n\\nBridgewater didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nArthur Breitman, 35, was an early fan of bitcoin, which first appeared around 2009. But he came to believe there were flaws in the blockchains behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, finding them hard to upgrade and not secure. He tried to come up with something better.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2014, while working at Morgan Stanley in quantitative finance, Breitman released two papers online that presented his concept for a new type of blockchain. He called it Tezos, a name his wife has said he coined after creating an algorithm that searched for the names of unclaimed websites pronounceable in English.\\n\\nThe papers were published under a pseudonym, “L. M Goodman,” but emails and messages from Arthur Breitman reviewed by Reuters make it clear he was the author.\\n\\nIn an email Breitman sent to an acquaintance in early 2015, he said he was seeking to create a business based on Tezos but was trying not to be associated publicly with the project at the time. He expressed worry that his activities might conflict with his employment at Morgan Stanley, messages show.\\n\\nReuters reviewed a copy of a “Tezos Business Plan” from early 2015, which listed Breitman as chief executive. The plan projected that if the company survived 15 years, it would be worth between $2 billion and $20 billion. The budget called for paying Breitman $212,180 in salary by year three. In August 2015, Breitman, who was still working at Morgan Stanley, set up a company in Delaware called Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc, or DLS, to develop Tezos. He listed himself as chief executive.\\n\\nThe U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requires registered securities professionals to provide prior written notice to their employer to conduct outside business activities if there is “reasonable expectation of compensation.” According to FINRA records, Breitman was registered and did not report any “other business activities.” Morgan Stanley and FINRA declined to comment.\\n\\n“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June. “It was a hobby, you know. And like there was never any intention to really commercialize any of the software.” She added: “We had some meetings with like C-suite executives at banks ... but honestly nothing serious.”\\n\\n“A TERRIBLE SALESMAN”\\n\\nIn 2015, Arthur Breitman was pitching “Tezos Inc.” in the hope of creating a consortium of four to five banks to adopt the technology and fund the operation. The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.\\n\\nBy then, blockchain was beginning to pique the interest of large financial institutions for its potential to help cut costs of cumbersome back-office processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities trades. Tezos’ 37-page business plan called it “an Internet for financial transactions” and said the technology could be used to automate the over-the-counter derivatives trading market.\\n\\nBut Breitman failed to attract backers. He told Reuters in June that he blamed his fundraising failures on the decision to develop the technology first, rather than just selling “a dream” as other blockchain startups were doing.\\n\\n“I guess I was a terrible salesman as well,” he said.\\n\\n“I can speak to that,” his wife said.\\n\\nKathleen Breitman, co-founder & CEO of Tezos, participates in the panel discussion \"Creating $200 Million Out of the Ether\" at the 2017 Forbes Under 30 Summit in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., October 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\\n\\nIn April 2016, Arthur left Morgan Stanley, and by that September, the Breitmans had started working on a new strategy for Tezos – to conduct an online fundraiser to distribute digital tokens, whose holders would maintain the Tezos blockchain. But the couple needed funds to keep the project going.\\n\\nOver the next six months, they received $612,000 from 10 early backers, including several cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to the Tezos.com website.\\n\\nTo conduct the ICO, the Breitmans chose a complex structure. Earlier this year, they helped to create a foundation based in Zug, Switzerland – dubbed “Crypto Valley” because of its many blockchain startups – that is seeking not-for-profit status, emails show. The idea, according to documents on the Tezos website, was that the foundation would raise money via the ICO, then acquire DLS, the Breitman-controlled company that has been developing Tezos.\\n\\nWorking through a Swiss foundation, the Breitmans thought, would provide regulatory oversight but not too much. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June that she and her husband opted to use a foundation based in Zug because Switzerland has “a regulatory authority that had a sufficient amount of oversight but not like anything too crazy.”\\n\\nGeorg von Schnurbein, co-author of a book on Swiss foundation governance, expressed surprise over cryptocurrency ventures like Tezos setting up not-for-profit foundations in Switzerland. “For me, the public interest is not clear,” he said. While not illegal, he said, creating a foundation with the aim of allowing inventors to profit from a sale conflicted with its status as a not-for-profit, which is supposed to benefit the public. He said federal regulators eventually might prohibit it.\\n\\n“The issue that there is some kind of for-profit entity and there are transfers right at the beginning is something that is working at the moment, but won’t be sustainable,” he said.\\n\\n“EXAGGERATED, TO SAY THE LEAST”\\n\\nAs work continued for the ICO, which was originally scheduled to be held in May, the project started running out of cash, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters. She spoke with Tim Draper, the well-known founding partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm DFJ and a staunch bitcoin supporter. He invested $1.5 million through his firm, Draper Associates, which included taking a minority stake in DLS, the company that controls the Tezos source code.\\n\\nThe Breitmans had also hired Strange Brew Strategies, a U.S. communications company, to promote their project, and Reuters wrote a news story on May 5 about Draper’s involvement.\\n\\nIn pitching the story to Reuters, John O‘Brien, a principal of Strange Brew, had made claims about Tezos’ progress. He wrote: “The applications of Tezos, ranging from derivatives settlement to micro-insurance, are real and recognized by industry giants. Ernst & Young, Deloitte, LexiFi, etc. have adopted Tezos in their development environments and labs.”\\n\\nOn Oct. 3, a spokeswoman for the accounting firm Ernst & Young told Reuters: “The statement is not correct. EY has not adopted Tezos.” A spokesman for Deloitte said Tezos’ code is “one of many technologies we’re considering” with blockchain, but it’s “still early stage and we haven’t used the technology for a client project.”\\n\\nJean-Marc Eber, CEO of the French software company LexiFi, said, “The sentence, as stated, isn’t accurate and unfortunately exaggerated, to say the least.” While there had been “informal contacts,” he said, “at this stage, LexiFi has not adopted Tezos’ technology in its development environment or labs.”\\n\\nStrange Brew declined to answer questions about the statement.\\n\\nSlideshow (9 Images)\\n\\nINVESTMENT OR DONATION?\\n\\nThe Tezos fundraiser began on July 1. The Breitmans had wide-ranging expectations about how much they might raise. A document on Tezos.com suggested that if they received more than $20 million, they might use it to “negotiate with a small nation-state” to adopt Tezzies, or acquire mainstream print and TV media outlets to promote the technology. In June, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that about a year ago, when the price of bitcoin was lower, “we were like, ‘Hey, we would be lucky if we get 20 million.\\'”\\n\\nWhen it ended after 13 days, the project received about 66,000 bitcoins and 361,000 ethers, worth about $232 million at the time. The hoard is now worth about twice that.\\n\\nKathleen Breitman told Reuters that participating in the Tezos fundraiser was like contributing to a public television station and receiving “a tote bag” in return. “That’s kind of the same thing here,” she said.\\n\\nThe fundraiser’s terms called the contributions “a non-refundable donation” and not a “speculative investment.”\\n\\nIf deemed a donation, and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of financial regulators in the United States. In the U.S., investments in assets such as company shares and other securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been studying ICOs, and in July issued an investor bulletin that warned: “Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.”\\n\\nPart of the SEC’s assessment is to examine the reasonable expectations of participants in the ICO. Some participants in the Tezos fundraiser told Reuters they viewed the coins at least partly as an investment.\\n\\nKevin Zhou, co-founder of the cryptocurrency trading fund Galois Capital, said he invested about five bitcoins in Tezos, which he considers overall one of the better ICOs.\\n\\n“For me and for a lot of people this is an investment. We are looking for a return,” Zhou said. “I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.\\n\\nDraper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation. Asked this month how much he donated during the Tezos fundraiser, he replied via email, “You mean how much I bought? A lot.”\\n\\n“TOTAL MENSCH”\\n\\nAt the moment, the Tezos Foundation holds all of the fundraising proceeds, while the Breitmans, through their Delaware company, control much of Tezos’ intellectual property. The plan is for the foundation to acquire the Breitmans’ company and release the technology under a free software license, according a “Transparency Memo” on the Tezos website.\\n\\nGevers, who founded the Tezos Foundation, said it has a contract that stipulates the Breitmans will either sell the Delaware company to the foundation “within a reasonable point of time” or, if they don‘t, “the foundation can take it.” He declined to provide a copy of the contract.\\n\\nWhen the foundation will acquire the Breitmans’ company remains unclear. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June, “Essentially, you know, they’re going to buy out the company in like July or so, I guess.”\\n\\nThe Breitmans stand to receive millions of dollars if the deal goes through. According to the “Transparency Memo,” the new blockchain “must launch and operate successfully” for three months, then DLS’s shareholders – the Breitmans and Draper – are entitled to receive 8.5 percent of the fundraiser proceeds in cash. That amount, according to Gevers, is about $19.7 million. The shareholders also are slated to receive another 10 percent of the Tezzies issued, with the coin distribution spread out over four years. Those coins currently are worth about $140 million in futures trading.\\n\\nPrior to the fundraiser, Kathleen Breitman effused about Gevers, 52, a Zug-based South African entrepreneur who has never before run a foundation. During an “Ask Me Anything” session in May on an online chat channel, she posted: “He’s awesome. Total mensch and very philosophically committed to our project.”\\n\\nRelations later soured. The Breitmans objected to people the foundation suggested it wanted to hire, Gevers said. Another sticking point: The couple’s company hasn’t relinquished control over the foundation’s own website, www.tezos.ch.\\n\\n“They control the foundation’s domains, websites and email servers, so the foundation has no control or confidentiality in its own communications,” Gevers said.\\n\\nThe Breitmans officially have no role at the Tezos Foundation. The letter from their lawyer this week proposed the creation of two foundation subsidiaries – Tezos AG and Tezos France SA – to develop and support Tezos, with the Breitmans serving as chief executive and chief technology officer of Tezos AG. The couple also would be given “observer status” on the foundation board. The foundation would then “limit” its activities to supervising and supporting the subsidiaries, “rather than conducting any direct operations.”\\n\\nAccording to von Schnurbein, under Swiss law “the foundation is completely independent and the foundation board is completely independent.” Gevers said the foundation wants the couple to continue playing a leading advisory role. “They are both very competent people and obviously they started this whole thing. And it would be stupid to exclude them.”\\n\\nBut he added: “You can rest assured as long as I have anything to do with this, the foundation will be independent.”\\n\\nGevers said he has filed a complaint with Swiss regulators about the request he received via email this week from the foundation’s two other board members that he step down from the board for a month. A spokesman for Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, which oversees the agency that supervises foundations, told Reuters that asking a board member to step aside must be done at a board meeting, not via email. The two board members who emailed Gevers didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nAs for the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies raised in the ICO, Gevers said the foundation has slowly begun selling the virtual currencies – lately about $10.2 million worth a week – and plans to invest the proceeds in a diverse portfolio. The funds are intended to be used to run the foundation, ensure Tezos works and help to develop products using the technology.\\n\\nSo where are all the bitcoins and ethers raised in the ICO stored? That, Gevers said, was confidential.\\n\\n“These are not held in any one place,” he said, “but secured through high-security” digital wallets “that no single party has control over.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCommentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'needs\\', \\'rico\\', \\'management\\', \\'help\\', \\'guide\\', \\'need\\', \\'disaster\\', \\'water\\', \\'power\\', \\'hurricanehit\\', \\'response\\', \\'insiders\\', \\'commentary\\', \\'puerto\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nWith post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.\\nMuch mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant.\\nIf it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response.\\nThe loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas.\\nThe principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nIt seems there’s a template that critics follow for Donald Trump versus the Hurricanes: they say he won’t do enough, that it isn’t being done fast enough, that everything will collapse (ready Katrina headlines) and then the draining, heroic reality of the response takes hold. With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.\\n\\nSoldiers of Puerto Rico\\'s national guard distribute relief supplies in San Juan after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria, September 24, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez\\n\\nA disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nJulie McNamara: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico\\'s post-hurricane misery\\n\\nPeter Apps: Spain\\'s missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis\\n\\nAt the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.\\n\\nIn dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.\\n\\nThe critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!\\n\\nThe needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.\\n\\nIt took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.\\n\\nOther decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.\\n\\nRescue workers help people after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Guayama, Puerto Rico, September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\\n\\nAt the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”\\n\\nThe military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.\\n\\nMilitary units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)\\n\\nMuch mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.\\n\\nPuerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.\\n\\nThat last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.\\n\\nSuccess with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.\\n\\nThese are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.\\n\\nSo don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.\\n\\nResponses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.\\n\\nBut a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBusiness News Video\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'vice\\', \\'umehara\\', \\'customers\\', \\'video\\', \\'president\\', \\'business\\', \\'kobe\\', \\'japanese\\', \\'naoto\\', \\'steel\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'saying\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nAnother bow, another apology ....

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\\n\\n“Daimler ist erfolgreich unterwegs”, erklärte Vorstandschef Dieter Zetsche am Freitag. Die robuste Pkw-Nachfrage in China und Europa macht die Absatzflaute in den USA mehr als wett. VW-Chef Matthias Müller kündigte für 2017 sogar das beste Ergebnis in der Geschichte des Volkswagen-Konzerns an. “Und nächstes Jahr wird es noch besser”, sagte Müller am Vorabend auf einer Veranstaltung in Passau. “Wir können haushalten”, betonte er mit Blick auf die nach wie vor teuren Altlasten. Analysten rechnen damit, dass VW bei Vorlage der Quartalsbilanz am 27. Oktober die Prognose anhebt.\\n\\nArndt Ellinghorst vom Investmentberater Evercore ISI erklärte, die Autokonjunktur erreiche jetzt den Höhepunkt. “Man kann von den Unternehmen nicht erwarten, dass sie die Ergebnisse endlos steigern”, sagte er. “Ich finde, die halten sich dafür alle sehr gut.” Schließlich kämpfen die Autobauer an mehreren Fronten gleichzeitig: Das durch jahrelange Abgas-Manipulationen stark beschädigte Image von Dieselautos beschleunigt den Umschwung zu Elektrofahrzeugen. Dies verschlingt ebenso wie die Entwicklung selbstfahrender, vernetzter Autos Milliarden. Und statt nur Autos zu verkaufen, müssen sich die Hersteller zu Anbietern von Mobilitätsdiensten wie Car-Sharing wandeln, mit sehr unsicheren Profitaussichten.\\n\\n“UNGLÜCKLICHE UMSTÄNDE”\\n\\nBei Daimler belastete die freiwillige Nachrüstung von mehr als drei Millionen Dieselautos zusammen mit einer anderen Rückrufaktion wegen Airbags das Betriebsergebnis mit fast einer halben Milliarde Euro. Der Gewinn vor Steuern und Zinsen (Ebit) sank von Juli bis September um 14 Prozent auf 3,45 Milliarden Euro. Ohne diese “unglücklichen Umstände” sehe der Trend bei den Schwaben jedoch gut aus, erklärten die Analysten von Bernstein-Research, die der Aktie einen Anstieg um gut 15 auf 85 Euro zutrauen. Am Freitag notierte das Papier nach anfänglichen Gewinnen unverändert, allerdings bewegte sich auch der Dax insgesamt nicht von der Stelle.\\n\\nDie um Sonderfaktoren bereinigte Rendite im Pkw-Geschäft der Sparte Mercedes-Benz Cars sei mit 11,1 Prozent nur geringfügig hinter dem Vorjahresstand zurückgeblieben, erklärte Branchenexperte Marc-René Tonn von der Bank Warburg. Zudem ist das Lkw-Geschäft auf Erholungskurs. Die zweitgrößte Sparte steigerte das Betriebsergebnis fast um ein Drittel auf 614 Millionen Euro, so dass Daimler die Gewinnprognose für das Gesamtjahr hier ebenfalls auf ein deutliches Plus von mehr als zehn Prozent anhob. Unter dem Strich erwirtschaftete der Weltmarktführer des Premiumsegments ein Konzernergebnis von 2,26 Milliarden Euro, 17 Prozent weniger als vor Jahresfrist. Der Umsatz legte um sechs Prozent auf 40,8 Milliarden Euro zu.\\n\\nDas operativ starke Geschäft wird allerdings von Rechtsrisiken überschattet: Ähnlich wie bei VW gibt es auch gegen Daimler Vorwürfe, Dieselabgase manipuliert zu haben. Den Wolfsburger Konzern kostete das schon 25 Milliarden Euro, vor allem für hohe Bußgelder in den USA. Daimler ist zudem so wie VW im Visier der Staatsanwaltschaft, die wegen des Betrugsverdachts mit Diesel-Abgaswerten ermittelt. Frank Schwope, Autoanalyst von der NordLB warnte, hieraus könnten theoretisch noch Milliarden-Lasten entstehen.\\n\\nZusammen mit den anderen Autobauern stehen die Schwaben außerdem unter Kartellverdacht in Europa. Nach einem Bericht des “Spiegel” vom Juli sollen sie sich in den 90er Jahren in großem Stil über Märkte und Strategien abgesprochen haben. Finanzchef Bodo Uebber erklärte, Daimler habe in der Sache Kronzeugenstatus bei der EU beantragt. Im Gegenzug könnte dem Konzern eine Strafe erlassen werden. Rücklagen dafür seien nicht notwendig.\\n\\nBEWEGLICHER WERDEN\\n\\nTrotz dieser Probleme fühlt sich Daimler stark genug, den Konzern umzubauen. Vorstandschef Zetsche will auf diese Weise Wachstumschancen besser ausschöpfen, wie er zu Wochenbeginn angekündigt hatte. Aus bislang fünf Divisionen sollen drei eigenständige Töchter werden: Das Pkw- und das Nutzfahrzeuggeschäft sollen voneinander getrennt und neben den Finanzdiensten als eigenständige Aktiengesellschaften etabliert werden. Es wäre der größte Umbau seit der Trennung vom US-Autobauer Chrysler vor rund zehn Jahren.\\n\\nDie endgültige Entscheidung wird nach eingehender Prüfung zwar erst 2019 fallen. Doch der Konzern steckt 100 Millionen Euro in die Vorbereitungsarbeiten, wie Finanzchef Uebber erklärte. Als eigenständige Einheit könnten die Sparten einfacher Überkreuzbeteiligungen mit Partnerunternehmen, etwa aus der IT-Branche eingehen. Analysten lobten den Plan. Daimler werde dadurch flexibler und beweglicher, erklärte etwa Stefan Bauknecht, Chef-Aktienanalyst der Deutsche-Bank-Tochter Deutsche Asset Management. “Allerdings wäre mehr Transparenz und Offenheit über die weitere ‘Roadmap’ nötig.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nGE rate le consensus sur le bénéfice, l\\'action chute\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'consensus\\', \\'ge\\', \\'à\\', \\'le\\', \\'et\\', \\'chute\\', \\'laction\\', \\'bénéfice\\', \\'du\\', \\'rate\\', \\'dollars\\', \\'la\\', \\'des\\', \\'sur\\', \\'en\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - General Electric a annoncé vendredi un bénéfice pour le troisième trimestre en forte baisse et largement inférieur au consensus, ce qui pèse sur le titre en avant-Bourse.\\nGeneral Electric a annoncé vendredi un bénéfice pour le troisième trimestre en forte baisse et largement inférieur au consensus, ce qui pèse sur le titre en avant-Bourse.\\nLe bénéfice de son activité énergie, qui construit des centrales électriques et des équipements pour le secteur, a chuté de 51% sur le trimestre.\\nLe bénéfice de la division électricité a chuté de 51% au cours du trimestre.\\nLe bénéfice non-ajusté tiré des opérations poursuivies a reculé à 1,80 milliard de dollars sur la période juin-septembre contre 1,99 milliard de dollars un an plus tôt.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - General Electric a annoncé vendredi un bénéfice pour le troisième trimestre en forte baisse et largement inférieur au consensus, ce qui pèse sur le titre en avant-Bourse.\\n\\nGeneral Electric a annoncé vendredi un bénéfice pour le troisième trimestre en forte baisse et largement inférieur au consensus, ce qui pèse sur le titre en avant-Bourse. /Photo prise le 20 avril 2017/REUTERS/Brian Snyder\\n\\nSur une base ajustée, le bénéfice par action du conglomérat américain s‘est établi à 29 cents alors que les analystes attendaient 49 cents, selon Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Diwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India\\'s majority Hindu community. The scene in New Delhi looked no different from the previous years despite the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers early this month to prevent a repeat of severe pollution levels that left the capital choking. However, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers. A local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions. Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years. Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nＦ１＝アロンソがマクラーレン残留、複数年で契約延長へ\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'women\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'ｆ１アロンソがマクラーレン残留複数年で契約延長へ\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLondon the starting line as Adidas laces up robotic shoe run\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'starting\\', \\'produce\\', \\'york\\', \\'shoes\\', \\'robots\\', \\'robotic\\', \\'shoe\\', \\'factory\\', \\'adidas\\', \\'plans\\', \\'turneradidas\\', \\'laces\\', \\'run\\', \\'line\\', \\'london\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Adidas has launched the first of six planned city-themed running shoe models in London as it capitalizes on its first Speedfactory, which it has opened in Germany and equipped with time-saving robotics.\\nA sample AM4LDN shoe is displayed, at the launch of Adidas\\' new shoe line, made in a factory largely operated by robots, in London, Britain October 19, 2017.\\nAfter London it plans shoe models inspired by Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.\\nA staff member displays a shoe, at the launch of Adidas\\' new shoe line, made in a factory largely operated by robots, in London, Britain October 19, 2017.\\nThe AM4LDN shoe aimed at the London market will go on sale next week for 169.95 pounds ($222.74) or 219.95 euros ($259.85).\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Adidas has launched the first of six planned city-themed running shoe models in London as it capitalizes on its first Speedfactory, which it has opened in Germany and equipped with time-saving robotics.\\n\\nA sample AM4LDN shoe is displayed, at the launch of Adidas\\' new shoe line, made in a factory largely operated by robots, in London, Britain October 19, 2017.

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.\\n\\nPeshmerga fighters wait near the Kurdish frontlines to vote in the region\\'s independence referendum, September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Marius Bosch\\n\\nAlong with the ongoing decimation of Iraq\\'s Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice \"Iraq\" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.\\n\\nThe waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nSamuel R. Bagenstos: How Congress is hacking away at disability rights\\n\\nTania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes\\n\\nThe post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.\\n\\nWhen the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.\\n\\nAnd it kind of worked. In the short run.\\n\\nThe Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.\\n\\nThe need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.\\n\\nThe ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a \"residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden\\'s idea.\\n\\nKurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani casts his vote in the Kurdish independence referendum in Erbil, Iraq September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Azad Lashkari\\n\\nIt probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.\\n\\nIn 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran\\'s western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.\\n\\nWith many of 2017\\'s regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.\\n\\nInstead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?\\n\\nIn a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn\\'t mean a direct separation from Iraq.”\\n\\nDarker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.\\n\\nAmerican policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.\\n\\nWhat seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.\\n\\nThe American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.\\n\\nSuch a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTrump promete aprobar recortes impuestos EEUU tras avance presupuesto en Senado\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'tras\\', \\'presupuesto\\', \\'millions\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'senado\\', \\'impuestos\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'avance\\', \\'recortes\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'warning\\', \\'eeuu\\', \\'promete\\', \\'turn\\', \\'en\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBattle for besieged Philippine city nears end\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'besieged\\', \\'sought\\', \\'spencer\\', \\'nears\\', \\'city\\', \\'white\\', \\'end\\', \\'battle\\', \\'university\\', \\'speech\\', \\'richard\\', \\'nazis\\', \\'protesters\\', \\'officers\\', \\'unrest\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nProtesters chanting \"Go home Nazis\" sought to drown out the speech by white nationalist Richard Spencer at the University of Florida, as the campus erected barricades and deployed hundreds of police officers to guard against unrest.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nProtesters chanting \"Go home Nazis\" sought to drown out the speech by white nationalist Richard Spencer at the University of Florida, as the campus erected barricades and deployed hundreds of police officers to guard against unrest.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nU.S. Senate passes budget bill crucial to GOP tax reform push\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'crucial\\', \\'bill\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'pave\\', \\'push\\', \\'president\\', \\'senate\\', \\'taxcut\\', \\'reform\\', \\'support\\', \\'tax\\', \\'way\\', \\'passes\\', \\'pursue\\', \\'gop\\', \\'budget\\', \\'republicans\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPresident Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPresident Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nDATOS-¿Cuáles son las prioridades legislativas del Gobierno de Argentina para después de las elecciones?\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'del\\', \\'millions\\', \\'las\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'elecciones\\', \\'datoscuáles\\', \\'prioridades\\', \\'massive\\', \\'legislativas\\', \\'para\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'gobierno\\', \\'son\\', \\'turn\\', \\'después\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n联通集团与阿里巴巴和腾讯将在云计算等方面展开合作\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'联通集团与阿里巴巴和腾讯将在云计算等方面展开合作\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n深度分析\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'深度分析\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nImages of March\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'peru\\', \\'images\\', \\'massive\\', \\'produced\\', \\'mosul\\', \\'retake\\', \\'photographers\\', \\'taken\\', \\'world\\', \\'month\\', \\'schultz\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nImages taken by Reuters photographers around the world for the month of March 2017, including the battle to retake Mosul, massive flooding in Peru, and the London attack.\\nProduced by Jeremy Schultz.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nImages taken by Reuters photographers around the world for the month of March 2017, including the battle to retake Mosul, massive flooding in Peru, and the London attack.

Macy’s said holiday hiring was “off to a great start”.\\n\\nBut staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand.\\n\\nThe staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.\\n\\n“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.\\n\\nHer clients include Lowe’s Cos Inc, Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs.\\n\\nU.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the “gig economy” and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool.\\n\\nThe hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nIn comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month.\\n\\nThe job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.\\n\\n“There just aren’t enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,” the site’s chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.\\n\\nNO BONUS\\n\\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics’ JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs.\\n\\nRecruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more.\\n\\n“The jobs have become bigger,” Manpower Group’s Hassett said. “A manager will do more at the stores, they’ll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to.”\\n\\nWal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.\\n\\n“We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,” said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart’s senior manager of corporate communications.\\n\\nJ.C. Penney said it was introducing paid time off for part-time hourly associates, starting from early 2018, to entice seasonal hires to stay beyond the holiday season.\\n\\nHigher up the food chain, recruiters also point to bonuses that have lagged other industries as harming efforts to draw in and keep talented regional managers or heads of business lines.\\n\\n“They (retailers) are paying lower bonuses and some companies have paid lower bonuses for a couple of years,” talent acquisition firm Korn Ferry’s retail expert Craig Rowley said.\\n\\nAn analysis by Korn Ferry of 40 big North American retailers showed that 73 percent paid little to no bonuses to senior executives for their performance in 2016.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\\n\\nEurope remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.\\n\\nTwo referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nJulie McNamara: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico\\'s misery\\n\\nJarrett Blanc: Trump\\'s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe\\n\\nThe tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”\\n\\nEurope, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.\\n\\nImmigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.\\n\\nIn Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”\\n\\nIn Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”\\n\\nThe phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are \"conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control\" in places with \"a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds.\" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.\"\\n\\nIn Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.\\n\\nIn her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.\\n\\nAcross the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.\\n\\nIt was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.\\n\\nBrexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries. Battles have been won on both sides. The war goes on.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nトップニュース\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'トップニュース\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n東芝、内部管理体制の改善報告を公表\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'東芝内部管理体制の改善報告を公表\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nفرنسا تقدم 15 مليون يورو مساعدة للمناطق المحررة من الدولة الإسلامية بسوريا\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'فرنسا\\', \\'الدولة\\', \\'المحررة\\', \\'تقدم\\', \\'app\\', \\'من\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'بسوريا\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'مليون\\', \\'يورو\\', \\'مساعدة\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'warning\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'للمناطق\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nEspanha apresentará medidas para impor regime direto sobre Catalunha em 21 de outubro\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'outubro\\', \\'regime\\', \\'espanha\\', \\'medidas\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'em\\', \\'catalunha\\', \\'impor\\', \\'massive\\', \\'para\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'sobre\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'direto\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBOJ\\'s next challenge: unwinding Kuroda\\'s legacy stimulus\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'kuroda\\', \\'tokyo\\', \\'inflation\\', \\'unwinding\\', \\'challenge\\', \\'boj\\', \\'legacy\\', \\'governor\\', \\'stimulus\\', \\'japan\\', \\'bank\\', \\'bojs\\', \\'kurodas\\', \\'monetary\\', \\'exit\\', \\'policy\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Toru Hanai/File PhotoWith inflation far below a 2 percent target, the BOJ rules out any near-term exit from Kuroda’s legacy ultra-easy policy.\\nMost of the BOJ’s nine board members and bureaucrats involved in drafting monetary policy feel the next step - though some way off - would be to roll back Kuroda’s radical monetary experiment, with the economy in recovery-mode, they say.\\nOpposition parties, including the new Party of Hope led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, want a departure from over-reliance on monetary policy.\\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2017.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTOKYO (Reuters) - For Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, Sunday’s general election has brought into focus the challenge of unwinding a massive stimulus program and yield curve control policy, while not hurting a budding but still fragile economy, the world’s third-largest.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\\n\\nWith inflation far below a 2 percent target, the BOJ rules out any near-term exit from Kuroda’s legacy ultra-easy policy.\\n\\nBut there’s growing alarm within the central bank about how long it can keep the money spigot open, given the rising costs and diminishing returns, people familiar with BOJ thinking say.\\n\\nMost of the BOJ’s nine board members and bureaucrats involved in drafting monetary policy feel the next step - though some way off - would be to roll back Kuroda’s radical monetary experiment, with the economy in recovery-mode, they say.\\n\\nThe political tide is shifting in favor of at least having such a debate.\\n\\nSeveral ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) heavyweights have warned of the rising cost of prolonged monetary easing. Opposition parties, including the new Party of Hope led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, want a departure from over-reliance on monetary policy.\\n\\n“The BOJ may be asked to explain more in parliament how it intends to exit,” said one of the people familiar with BOJ thinking. “That would require some changes in communication.”\\n\\nBOJ bureaucrats are drafting a plan. The trick is to retreat from crisis-mode stimulus without giving the impression the bank is embarking on outright monetary tightening.\\n\\nAlready, the BOJ is proceeding with the first stage of the plan - by whittling down its vast bond purchases to an annual pace of around 50 trillion yen ($443 billion), below a loose pledge to keep it at around 80 trillion yen.\\n\\nThe next step would be to allow long-term interest rates, which the BOJ has capped at around zero, to rise, more reflecting improvements in the economy, the sources say. The bank could raise the bond yield target or shift it to the shorter end of the curve even before inflation hits 2 percent, as it can maintain easy monetary conditions with its strong balance sheet.\\n\\n“If long-term rates rise naturally, reflecting improvements in the economy, the BOJ may not need to cap 10-year yields at zero,” one of the people said. It could then raise short-term rates, though reducing the size of its balance sheet could be years away.\\n\\nLEARNING FROM THE FED\\n\\nAfter a massive asset-buying program that Kuroda deployed in 2013 failed to fire up inflation, the BOJ reverted last September to a policy targeting interest rates.\\n\\nSince then, the bank has begun to more openly debate an exit.\\n\\nDeputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso said the BOJ can learn from the U.S. Federal Reserve when withdrawing stimulus, while another deputy governor said the BOJ is conducting exit simulations.\\n\\nKuroda concedes that meeting the inflation goal will take time as shocking the public out of deflation proved tough - a sea change from his 2013 pledge the target could be met in just two years.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso speaks during an interview with Reuters at BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 9, 2015.

Any sign of diminishing BOJ presence may jolt the bond market, which saw liquidity dwindle as the bank gobbled up roughly 40 percent of the market.\\n\\nStocks are also heavily reliant on the BOJ buying exchange-traded funds, so any slowdown in that could hit stock prices and business sentiment.\\n\\nAnd there’s the question of who will next be leading the BOJ.\\n\\nIf Prime Minister Shinzo Abe holds on to power, there’s a good chance he would reappoint Kuroda for another term, analysts say. He’d still have to heed growing calls for more debate on an exit strategy.\\n\\nSeiko Noda, a cabinet minister seen as Abe’s leadership rival, has called for scrutiny on the rising cost of prolonged easy policy. And Abe himself no longer calls on the BOJ to do whatever it takes to achieve 2 percent inflation, saying only he hopes the bank will “keep up efforts” to end deflation.\\n\\n“The biggest flaw of the BOJ’s current framework is the difficulty of an exit,” said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official and now chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\\n\\n“The BOJ has kept mum on this, but it may change that stance if the political sentiment begins to shift.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nData Dive: Slipping into famine\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'famine\\', \\'data\\', \\'slipping\\', \\'millions\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'dive\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nFrance to give 15 million euros in aid for Syrian areas freed from Islamic State\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'minister\\', \\'le\\', \\'aid\\', \\'euros\\', \\'million\\', \\'foreign\\', \\'france\\', \\'15\\', \\'syrian\\', \\'state\\', \\'water\\', \\'islamic\\', \\'jeanyves\\', \\'usled\\', \\'drian\\', \\'areas\\', \\'freed\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPARIS (Reuters) - France will provide 15 million euros (13.39 million pounds) in aid for areas liberated by the U.S.-led coalition from Islamic State in Syria, its foreign minister said on Friday.\\nFILE PHOTO: French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian speaks at the Presidential palace in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, October 02, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon“I have decided to allocate additional funds of 15 million euros up to the end of the year for food, de-mining, displaced people, water and health,” Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement, without saying who would manage the funds.\\n“France also hopes that the governance of these territories will meet the needs and aspirations of the populations and facilitate reconciliation.”\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPARIS (Reuters) - France will provide 15 million euros (13.39 million pounds) in aid for areas liberated by the U.S.-led coalition from Islamic State in Syria, its foreign minister said on Friday.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian speaks at the Presidential palace in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, October 02, 2017.

But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.\\n\\nDemonstrators hold flags ahead of a speech by Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May in Florence, Italy September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Max Rossi\\n\\nLast June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”\\n\\nBrexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.\\n\\nNo matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.\\n\\nIt is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”\\n\\nThat feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.\\n\\nThe British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”\\n\\nGiving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.\\n\\nHer Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.\\n\\nMay’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.\\n\\nA combination of images shows Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May speaking at the Complesso Santa Maria Novella, Florence, Italy September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jeff J Mitchell/Pool\\n\\nSpeaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”\\n\\nThe former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.\\n\\nThese “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.\\n\\nIn a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nTania Karas: At the UN, Trump\\'s silences spoke volumes\\n\\nMaysam Behravesh: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan\\n\\nPaul Wallace: Don\\'t be fooled by Merkel\\'s aura of invincibility\\n\\nAdmitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.\\n\\nTheir decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.\\n\\nPrime Minister May, brave as she is to shoulder the task, may not be up to it. Foreign Secretary Johnson careless as he is with both the truth and his loyalty, may be. Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister. Such is the mayhem unleashed by the effort to satisfy the popular will.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCanada\\'s Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie dies, PM weeps\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'songs\\', \\'family\\', \\'known\\', \\'weeps\\', \\'downie\\', \\'tragically\\', \\'gord\\', \\'national\\', \\'trudeau\\', \\'singer\\', \\'music\\', \\'dies\\', \\'hip\\', \\'canadas\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.\\nCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sheds tears as he speaks about the death of Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie.\\n“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.\\nFormed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.\\nA book of condolence is pictured at a makeshift memorial for the late Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie in Kingston, Ontario, Canada October 18, 2017.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.\\n\\nCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sheds tears as he speaks about the death of Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie.

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\\n\\nUntil 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.\\n\\nSterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.\\n\\nBut May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.\\n\\nAfter the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.\\n\\nFor many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.\\n\\n“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.\\n\\n“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”\\n\\nVICIOUS CYCLE\\n\\nMarkets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.\\n\\nBut there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.\\n\\nAnxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.\\n\\nSterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017.

People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”\\n\\nBarclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.\\n\\n“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”\\n\\nMuch will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.\\n\\nThat would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.\\n\\nEd Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.\\n\\n”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.\\n\\n“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nData Dive: The UK Election: By the numbers\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'election\\', \\'dive\\', \\'numbers\\', \\'data\\', \\'uk\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nData Dive: The UK Election: By the numbers\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nData Dive: The UK Election: By the numbers\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nSir Richard Branson open to partnering with Elon Musk on hyperloop\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'elon\\', \\'branson\\', \\'virgin\\', \\'tells\\', \\'katayama\\', \\'scam\\', \\'help\\', \\'million\\', \\'islands\\', \\'targeted\\', \\'recover\\', \\'richard\\', \\'partnering\\', \\'musk\\', \\'open\\', \\'sir\\', \\'hyperloop\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nThe founder of the Virgin Group tells Reuters\\' Fred Katayama what he\\'ll bring to Hyperloop One, the $5 million scam that targeted him, and his efforts to help the Virgin Islands recover.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nThe founder of the Virgin Group tells Reuters\\' Fred Katayama what he\\'ll bring to Hyperloop One, the $5 million scam that targeted him, and his efforts to help the Virgin Islands recover.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTop News & Business Videos\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'videos\\', \\'merkel\\', \\'british\\', \\'talks\\', \\'business\\', \\'angela\\', \\'step\\', \\'britain\\', \\'leaders\\', \\'eu\\', \\'summit\\', \\'brexit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nThe UK\\'s decision to leave the EU has at times left British Prime Minister Theresa May looking like the unpopular kid at school.\\nThe choreography on the first day of this European Union summit showing May talking animatedly with the EU\\'s most important leaders - France\\'s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\\'s Angela Merkel.\\nThat as May urged a new dynamic on Brexit talks.\\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING: \"Contrary to how it is sometimes represented in the British press - this process is moving forward step by step.\\nEU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nThe UK\\'s decision to leave the EU has at times left British Prime Minister Theresa May looking like the unpopular kid at school.

EU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill. They are expected on Friday (October 20) to set a target of December for London to improve its divorce settlement offer. But in a conciliatory gesture they are also likely to call on their staff to prepare for the next stage of talks.

Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People’s Bank of China, grabbed headlines by warning on Thursday of a possible “Minsky moment.” His reference to a potential financial and economic crash follows other urgent calls for reform in recent days. The comments seem aimed at burnishing his legacy, as well as trying to ensure a like-minded successor fills his shoes.\\n\\nChina\\'s central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan speaks during a session on the second day of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter - RC12D9038530\\n\\nZhou is quiet, even by his profession’s standards, and usually grants interviews only when he needs to calm markets. Yet on Oct. 9, Caijin magazine published a rare interview in which the central banker made a strikingly direct call for a more open capital account. At a panel on Sunday in Washington, D.C., he stressed the need to tackle the country’s $18 trillion in corporate debt. And on Thursday, he talked at length about leverage and financial risks on the sidelines of the Communist Party Congress.\\n\\nThe 69-year-old governor is expected to step down soon and would no doubt like to burnish his legacy as a reformer who has worked to liberalize China’s markets and open them up to foreign investors. His most tangible accomplishment came last year when the International Monetary Fund included the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies, the Special Drawing Right.\\n\\nHis warning might also be an effort to buy some reputational insurance – a case of “I told you so” if a mounting debt burden causes the economy to shudder. In context, his recent speeches are even-handed. But Zhou has been at this game for 15 years. He must know that merely using the term Minsky moment, or saying the country can never have an open economy with a tightly controlled currency, will resound all the more during the most sensitive time of China’s political calendar.\\n\\nTop officials are in Beijing for the Communist Party Congress, a once-in-five-years gathering where they will likely discuss Zhou’s successor as well as the remit and personnel of bureaucracies overseeing the financial system. The governor’s remarks all but ensure that the case for reform will be top of mind during these closed-door discussions, and might even tip the balance toward someone in his mold succeeding him as governor. If there’s a time for the departing central banker to speak up, this is surely it.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nISS astronauts take another walk in space\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'station\\', \\'replacing\\', \\'joe\\', \\'randy\\', \\'walk\\', \\'astronauts\\', \\'reporter\\', \\'nasa\\', \\'space\\', \\'iss\\', \\'spacewalk\\', \\'light\\', \\'outside\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNASA astronauts Joe Acaba and Randy Bresnik perform a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to make some minor repairs and install a HD camera and replacing a light.\\nRough Cut (no reporter narration).\\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) NASA astronauts Joe Acaba and Randy Bresnik ventured outside to repair the International Space Station on Friday.\\nThe tasks included installing a HD camera and replacing a light.\\nThis is Expedition 53 crew\\'s third and final spacewalk in the current series.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNASA astronauts Joe Acaba and Randy Bresnik perform a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to make some minor repairs and install a HD camera and replacing a light.

Diwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India\\'s majority Hindu community. The scene in New Delhi looked no different from the previous years despite the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers early this month to prevent a repeat of severe pollution levels that left the capital choking. However, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers. A local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions. Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years. Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nJPMorgan estima que peso mexicano se hundiría hasta 21.9 por dólar sin el TLCAN\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'que\\', \\'se\\', \\'tlcan\\', \\'peso\\', \\'sin\\', \\'por\\', \\'mexicano\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'jpmorgan\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'hasta\\', \\'hundiría\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLa cantante Jewel aprendió lecciones de vida de la naturaleza, los libros y el dolor\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'mi\\', \\'que\\', \\'las\\', \\'es\\', \\'lecciones\\', \\'el\\', \\'jewel\\', \\'y\\', \\'libros\\', \\'para\\', \\'naturaleza\\', \\'una\\', \\'dolor\\', \\'los\\', \\'vida\\', \\'la\\', \\'en\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nJewel compartió algunas de sus experiencias para la serie de Reuters “Lecciones de Vida”.\\nRespuesta: La naturaleza, los libros, y el dolor.\\nMi mamá se fue cuando yo tenía ocho años y mi papá se encargó de criar tres niños, y era un alcohólico abusador.\\nP: ¿Qué te enseñó el dormir en tu coche sobre el dinero y la supervivencia?\\nR: Fundé Project Clean Water en 1997, porque cuando estuve en la calle no podía comprar agua embotellada.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNUEVA YORK (Reuters) - El ascenso de Jewel en el mundo de la música desde la inhóspita Alaska hasta el estrellato es grande: una chica que soporta un entorno abusivo, se queda en la calle, y luego no sólo sobrevive sino que alcanza la cumbre de su profesión.\\n\\nLa cantautora Jewel habla durante la rueda de prensa de SALT en Las Vegas, Nevada, EEUU, el 18 de mayo de 2017.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\\n\\nWith inflation far below a 2 percent target, the BOJ rules out any near-term exit from Kuroda’s legacy ultra-easy policy.\\n\\nBut there’s growing alarm within the central bank about how long it can keep the money spigot open, given the rising costs and diminishing returns, people familiar with BOJ thinking say.\\n\\nMost of the BOJ’s nine board members and bureaucrats involved in drafting monetary policy feel the next step - though some way off - would be to roll back Kuroda’s radical monetary experiment, with the economy in recovery-mode, they say.\\n\\nThe political tide is shifting in favor of at least having such a debate.\\n\\nSeveral ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) heavyweights have warned of the rising cost of prolonged monetary easing. Opposition parties, including the new Party of Hope led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, want a departure from over-reliance on monetary policy.\\n\\n“The BOJ may be asked to explain more in parliament how it intends to exit,” said one of the people familiar with BOJ thinking. “That would require some changes in communication.”\\n\\nBOJ bureaucrats are drafting a plan. The trick is to retreat from crisis-mode stimulus without giving the impression the bank is embarking on outright monetary tightening.\\n\\nAlready, the BOJ is proceeding with the first stage of the plan - by whittling down its vast bond purchases to an annual pace of around 50 trillion yen ($443 billion), below a loose pledge to keep it at around 80 trillion yen.\\n\\nThe next step would be to allow long-term interest rates, which the BOJ has capped at around zero, to rise, more reflecting improvements in the economy, the sources say. The bank could raise the bond yield target or shift it to the shorter end of the curve even before inflation hits 2 percent, as it can maintain easy monetary conditions with its strong balance sheet.\\n\\n“If long-term rates rise naturally, reflecting improvements in the economy, the BOJ may not need to cap 10-year yields at zero,” one of the people said. It could then raise short-term rates, though reducing the size of its balance sheet could be years away.\\n\\nLEARNING FROM THE FED\\n\\nAfter a massive asset-buying program that Kuroda deployed in 2013 failed to fire up inflation, the BOJ reverted last September to a policy targeting interest rates.\\n\\nSince then, the bank has begun to more openly debate an exit.\\n\\nDeputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso said the BOJ can learn from the U.S. Federal Reserve when withdrawing stimulus, while another deputy governor said the BOJ is conducting exit simulations.\\n\\nKuroda concedes that meeting the inflation goal will take time as shocking the public out of deflation proved tough - a sea change from his 2013 pledge the target could be met in just two years.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso speaks during an interview with Reuters at BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 9, 2015. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo\\n\\nGone, too, are his threats to ramp up stimulus to reach his price target sooner.\\n\\nAdam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the shift to yield curve control a year ago was a normalization of monetary policy in a narrow sense.\\n\\n“Everybody says nowadays that a central bank’s goal is price stability or stable low-rate inflation. But what we really care about is people’s well being,” he said. “I don’t think (the BOJ) needs to add stimulus.”\\n\\nCOST OF DELAY\\n\\nDelaying an exit from the ultra-loose policy could be costly.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\\n\\nAs the U.S. Fed and the European Central Bank begin to roll back post-financial crisis unconventional policies, the divergence could trigger market turbulence.\\n\\nBound by near-zero rates, the BOJ could be left with fewer tools than its peers to battle another recession.\\n\\n“The BOJ needs to start normalizing policy, at least from 2018, when the economy is still in good shape,” said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research and a veteran BOJ watcher. “Otherwise, it will lose the window of opportunity to exit.”\\n\\nProlonged easing could also destabilize the banking system by eroding bank profits, a warning the International Monetary Fund made in a report this month.\\n\\nStill, finding the way out from years of heavy money printing isn’t easy. Any sign of diminishing BOJ presence may jolt the bond market, which saw liquidity dwindle as the bank gobbled up roughly 40 percent of the market.\\n\\nStocks are also heavily reliant on the BOJ buying exchange-traded funds, so any slowdown in that could hit stock prices and business sentiment.\\n\\nAnd there’s the question of who will next be leading the BOJ.\\n\\nIf Prime Minister Shinzo Abe holds on to power, there’s a good chance he would reappoint Kuroda for another term, analysts say. He’d still have to heed growing calls for more debate on an exit strategy.\\n\\nSeiko Noda, a cabinet minister seen as Abe’s leadership rival, has called for scrutiny on the rising cost of prolonged easy policy. And Abe himself no longer calls on the BOJ to do whatever it takes to achieve 2 percent inflation, saying only he hopes the bank will “keep up efforts” to end deflation.\\n\\n“The biggest flaw of the BOJ’s current framework is the difficulty of an exit,” said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official and now chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\\n\\n“The BOJ has kept mum on this, but it may change that stance if the political sentiment begins to shift.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nU.S. hospitals get creative with perks to attract nurses\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'offering\\', \\'shortage\\', \\'hospitals\\', \\'perks\\', \\'nurses\\', \\'housing\\', \\'free\\', \\'signing\\', \\'attract\\', \\'bonuses\\', \\'creative\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nHospitals across the U.S. are offering $10,000 signing bonuses, free housing and other perks to attract more nurses during an acute shortage.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nHospitals across the U.S. are offering $10,000 signing bonuses, free housing and other perks to attract more nurses during an acute shortage.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nU.S. tax plan hopes boost stocks, dollar\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'inflation\\', \\'points\\', \\'york\\', \\'investors\\', \\'hopes\\', \\'tax\\', \\'senate\\', \\'stocks\\', \\'yields\\', \\'plan\\', \\'index\\', \\'dollar\\', \\'london\\', \\'boost\\', \\'rose\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 20, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Brendan McDermidU.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.\\nThe dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.7 percent to $1.1767.\\nMSCI\\'s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.01 percent and was edging towards record highs.\\n(This version of the story updates to U.S. trading, changes dateline to NEW YORK, previous LONDON; refiles to add dropped byline)\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks climbed, along with the U.S. dollar and bond yields on Friday, as investors anticipated President Donald Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint that paves the way for tax cuts.\\n\\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 20, 2017.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\\n\\nIn a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”\\n\\nThe overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his \"America first\" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.\\n\\nIndeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.\\n\\nThe three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.\\n\\nBut the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.\\n\\nIn his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.\\n\\nThese omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nMaysam Behravesh: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan\\n\\nPaul Wallace: Don\\'t be fooled by Merkel\\'s aura of invincibility\\n\\nAny call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”\\n\\nFor all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.\\n\\nAs for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.\\n\\nTrump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)\\n\\nHe did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.\\n\\nThe focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.\\n\\nWhat Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBreakingviews TV: Cooling GE’s jets\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'jets\\', \\'spare\\', \\'breakingviews\\', \\'possible\\', \\'predecessors\\', \\'likely\\', \\'reduced\\', \\'targets\\', \\'preview\\', \\'rob\\', \\'ges\\', \\'richard\\', \\'ranging\\', \\'tv\\', \\'cooling\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nRob Cox and Richard Beales preview GE’s forthcoming earnings, the first for new CEO John Flannery, and likely changes ranging from grounding his predecessor’s spare airplane to possible reduced financial targets and dividend cuts.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nRob Cox and Richard Beales preview GE’s forthcoming earnings, the first for new CEO John Flannery, and likely changes ranging from grounding his predecessor’s spare airplane to possible reduced financial targets and dividend cuts.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBusiness confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'warned\\', \\'grips\\', \\'crisis\\', \\'plummets\\', \\'economy\\', \\'business\\', \\'britain\\', \\'confidence\\', \\'election\\', \\'uk\\', \\'single\\', \\'uncertainty\\', \\'political\\', \\'think\\', \\'brexit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s descent into political crisis just days before Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence among business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU.\\nThe IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.\\nAnd the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.\\nSome executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.\\nLEFT IN LIMBOBusiness executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s descent into political crisis just days before Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence among business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A protestor wears a Theresa May mask, London, Britain June 9, 2017. REUTERS/Marko Djurica/File Photo\\n\\nThe failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week\\'s election has pushed the world\\'s fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.\\n\\nMay called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.\\n\\nInstead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.\\n\\n“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\n\\n“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”\\n\\nA survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.\\n\\nThe IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.\\n\\n“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.\\n\\nThe collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.\\n\\nFigures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.\\n\\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.\\n\\nAnd the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.\\n\\nBoth groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.\\n\\nSome executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.\\n\\n“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.\\n\\n“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”\\n\\nHaving slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.\\n\\nLEFT IN LIMBO\\n\\nBusiness executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.\\n\\nLeaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.\\n\\nAndy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.\\n\\nAnd Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”\\n\\n“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.\\n\\nBankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.\\n\\n“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.\\n\\nGareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.\\n\\n“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nThis week in sports: Stunning upset for

REUTERS/Stringer -\\n\\nJust a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\\n\\nTraders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.\\n\\nU.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.\\n\\nQatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.\\n\\nThe agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.\\n\\nMore worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.\\n\\nQatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.\\n\\nHowever, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.\\n\\nContainers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”\\n\\nShoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.\\n\\nEXCLUSION ZONES\\n\\nWith exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.\\n\\nBans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.\\n\\nA map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\\n\\nLying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.\\n\\nQatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.\\n\\nThe UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.\\n\\n“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.\\n\\nLNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.\\n\\nCairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nAny tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.\\n\\nAnother test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.\\n\\nAny sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.\\n\\nLast year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.\\n\\n“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.\\n\\nThe rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.\\n\\nCircumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nFed to step-up focus on payment security with study, working groups: Fed\\'s Powell\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'stepup\\', \\'focus\\', \\'payment\\', \\'payments\\', \\'including\\', \\'industry\\', \\'study\\', \\'groups\\', \\'fed\\', \\'security\\', \\'fintech\\', \\'powell\\', \\'working\\', \\'bank\\', \\'reserve\\', \\'system\\', \\'feds\\', \\'financial\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is stepping-up its focus on payment security as the industry reaches a “critical juncture” driven by new technologies, Federal Reserve board governor Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.\\nFederal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell discusses financial regulation in Washington, U.S., October 3, 2017.\\nFintech firms and banks are embracing this change, as they strive to address consumer demands for more timely and convenient payments,” said Powell.\\nPowell’s comments underline growing concerns among financial market participants and regulators about the risks cyber thieves pose to the financial system following a series of recent incidents.\\nDuring that incident, hackers broke into the computers of Bangladesh’s central bank and sent fake payment orders, tricking the Federal Reserve Bank of New York into transferring the funds.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is stepping-up its focus on payment security as the industry reaches a “critical juncture” driven by new technologies, Federal Reserve board governor Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.\\n\\nFederal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell discusses financial regulation in Washington, U.S., October 3, 2017.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\\n\\nWith the euro zone economic recovery well into its fifth year, the time has come to cut stimulus. Yet, overly ambitious tightening could choke off the very growth Draghi has fostered, threatening to undo years of work.\\n\\nDraghi also has to find common ground between policy hawks, who argue the ECB has spent its firepower so any further stimulus has negligible effect, and doves, who point to persistently weak inflation as evidence the bank has not met its price-stability mandate.\\n\\nThe compromise is likely to be a cut in bond purchases at Thursday’s policy meeting, twinned with a lengthy extension of stimulus and a commitment to keep rates low for many years to come.\\n\\nSuch a move would ensure that easy policy persists while also reducing the ECB’s reliance on unconventional tools and potentially paving the way to exit bond purchases.\\n\\nThe problem is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, unemployment remains high, wage growth is barely visible and inflation will probably not rise back to the ECB’s target before the end of the decade.\\n\\nThe bond purchases have depressed borrowing costs but the ECB is slowly running out of debt to buy so it either takes a step toward the exit or redraws the rules of the program, a potentially controversial move that may send the wrong signal.\\n\\nA Reuters poll of economists concluded the ECB Central Bank it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to 40 billion euros from 60 billion euros in January.\\n\\nIt was mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.\\n\\nSources close to the ECB’s pre-meeting discussions say the a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between 25 and 40 billion euros a month.\\n\\nBut the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.\\n\\nWhile this debate is still open, sources speaking to Reuters said it is more likely the bank would maintain the flexibility and even signal a willingness to increase asset buys if the outlook sours.\\n\\nThat, says UBS, is crucial: “We view the duration of the extension in net asset purchases as more important than the monthly size in ensuring the ECB’s ability to manage the expectations around its future policy.”\\n\\nNew bond purchases will add little to inflation. But they will buy the ECB some time as it waits for growth to finally translate into inflation.\\n\\nIn a glimmer of hope for policymakers, Germany’s largest trade union recently asked for a 6 percent wage hike for nearly 4 million workers, an ambitious move, which could lift wages across the board as many employee groups look to IG Metall to set the trend.\\n\\nEuro zone inflation - currently at 1.5 percent - remains well below the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent and expectations are for it to stay that way at least until 2019.\\n\\nHURRICANES\\n\\nWhile the euro zone enjoys its growth run, the United States, the world’s biggest economy, probably suffered a major hit last quarter, mostly due to the disruptions from hurricanes.\\n\\nAn advance release of third quarter data at the end of the coming week is likely to show growth slowing to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent with a decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\\n\\nRebuilding efforts are, however, expected to boost GDP growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2018, suggesting that the dip is temporary and will be mostly compensated for in the coming quarters.\\n\\n“Damages from the hurricanes will likely total around $150 billion, with an unusually large portion of that coming from business interruption to refineries, petrochemical plants, restaurants and residential construction,” Wells Fargo said, predicting that hurricanes shaved about 0.9 percentage points off Q3 growth.\\n\\nBut economists added that if the weather distortions fade quickly, the U.S. Federal Reserve would remain on course to hike rates before the end of the year, given that the economy is essentially at full employment.\\n\\nA compromise on a tax reform package and a growth rebound could also solidify expectations for two more hikes next year, analysts added.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nFinancial, security woes undermine Libya\\'s oil recovery\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'recovery\\', \\'north\\', \\'security\\', \\'oil\\', \\'threaten\\', \\'revival\\', \\'production\\', \\'undermined\\', \\'woes\\', \\'problems\\', \\'financial\\', \\'undermine\\', \\'libyas\\', \\'stability\\', \\'promise\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLibya\\'s oil production revival is being undermined by the same financial, economic and security problems that threaten the promise of stability and a better life for the divided North African nation.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLibya\\'s oil production revival is being undermined by the same financial, economic and security problems that threaten the promise of stability and a better life for the divided North African nation.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nParis wants to regulate Asian bike-share operators\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'gobeebike\\', \\'bikes\\', \\'told\\', \\'city\\', \\'regulate\\', \\'launched\\', \\'bikeshare\\', \\'startup\\', \\'operators\\', \\'paris\\', \\'plans\\', \\'asian\\', \\'bikesharing\\', \\'wants\\', \\'london\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPARIS (Reuters) - Paris does not want Asian bike-sharing operators to burst into the city the way Airbnb and Uber did and plans to introduce regulation to ensure an orderly rollout of new bicycle schemes, a top city official told Reuters.\\nSeveral \\'Gobee.bike\\' bicycles, a city bike-sharing service, by Hong Kong startup Gobee.bike, are seen on a sidewalk in Paris, France, October 10, 2017.\\nSeveral \\'Gobee.bike\\' bicycles, a city bike-sharing service, by Hong Kong startup Gobee.bike, are seen on a sidewalk in Paris, France, October 9, 2017.\\nMissika said several operators have contacted the city to discuss introducing their bike schemes, including Ofo’s big Chinese competitor Mobike.\\nSingapore startup oBike, which has launched its bikes in London, Munich, Madrid and Zurich, already has a team in Paris.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPARIS (Reuters) - Paris does not want Asian bike-sharing operators to burst into the city the way Airbnb and Uber did and plans to introduce regulation to ensure an orderly rollout of new bicycle schemes, a top city official told Reuters.\\n\\nSeveral \\'Gobee.bike\\' bicycles, a city bike-sharing service, by Hong Kong startup Gobee.bike, are seen on a sidewalk in Paris, France, October 10, 2017.

His latest full-length feature, \"Ajji\" (Grandmother), is the dark tale of an old woman who sets out to avenge the rape of her granddaughter.\\n\\nHandout photo of director Devashish Makhija\\n\\nMakhija tells Reuters why “Ajji” is about urban privilege and how the making of the film took a toll on his health.\\n\\nQ: One of the big themes that emerge out of “Ajji” is urban privilege. Why was that important?\\n\\nA: I don’t know if you have seen my short films, but I do this in all my stories. Not only because I feel guilty being born into a middle-class family and having three meals a day, but because I have actively travelled in tribal areas. When I came to Mumbai, I stayed in a slum for the first two years. I have actively tried to understand inequality, because inequality manifests in injustice. The law, though it says it is equal for all, everyone cannot access it. In all my stories, I try to remind those who have a little privilege that you are having it easy and there is someone out there who is not.\\n\\nQ: How did you end up living in a slum?\\n\\nA: I am from Calcutta. I was a journalist for a bit, in advertising for a bit, and I just couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do. I had a few friends who knew videography and they said, “Come here”. I came to Mumbai and lived in a slum rehabilitation colony. I didn’t have a choice – I didn’t have too much money. My mum had just passed and I had walked away from life as I knew it. Living there, I started questioning my life as it had been up until then.\\n\\nThe first film I worked on was \"Black Friday\". Even during the research of that film, we worked in the ghettos like Behrampada, Navpada. We lived in those areas for days and that just set me on a journey I couldn’t turn back from. I have taken it upon myself to put these people in all my stories - to tell stories about them because they are not represented in the mainstream.\\n\\nI could have made “Ajji” more arthouse than it actually is. But somewhere in its story-telling, I tried to make it accessible. I tried to keep the thrill and drama going because I want the mainstream to watch it so that they will think about the other sections of society.\\n\\nQ: What have you learned about the “other sections”?\\n\\nHandout still from the movie \"Ajji\"\\n\\nA: There’s nothing that I learned from them. The more time I spend in strata and milieus that I don’t belong to, the more I learn about us. The fact that we take too much for granted. We feel wronged about being shortchanged while buying a pair of shoes. And over there is a grandmother whose granddaughter had her life taken from her as she knew it. She will never be the same again. That level of shortchange doesn’t compare to this. There is such a dichotomy and we understand life at such a different level... we operate at such a different frequency.\\n\\nQ: Does it frustrate you as a film-maker that we don’t see too many of these subjects in the mainstream?\\n\\nA: No, it doesn’t. And I try and not be arrogant about it. This film, even though it was made at a frighteningly low budget of 1.2 crores (12 million rupees), is still one point two crores, the kind of money I will never see at one go in my lifetime. And I am using someone else’s money to make my film. If someone is giving you money, they don’t want you to hold a mirror to them. They want to escape somewhere else. I get that and I have no sour grapes about that.\\n\\nQ: How did you come up with the character of Ajji, the protagonist in your film?\\n\\nA: Ajji was a response to a lot of things, (like) the constant reportage of rape after Nirbhaya. After a point, the film goes beyond rape and revenge. It is about all these inequalities. I had an idea about the most unlikely candidate in a family who would go out and do something about this. And the answer was the grandmother. And we made it even harder for her – we gave her arthritis, we made her live in a milieu where the patriarchy is so systemic that you don’t even realise it’s there until something gets out of hand. The truth of rape-revenge is so universal that I knew that if I make it dramatic enough, I’ll have the audience. The question was - how do I throw in all the other things that I wanted to talk about. That is how Ajji emerged.\\n\\nQ: Your villain is completely despicable. Did he have to be that way for the film to work?\\n\\nA: That’s a fair question. But like I said, in that milieu, the patriarchy is 5,000 years old. I was trying to distill that thought process into a person. Dhawale is not a person, but a thought process, and because it is so powerful, he had to be that way.\\n\\nQ: You said that the making of the film affected your health.\\n\\nA: (Pauses). I finally feel ready to talk about it. All of last year, during the making of the film, I started hating on my own masculinity. I was in prep in September last year when I started urinating blood. I was in severe pain and thought I wouldn’t be able to shoot. A doctor at the Hinduja Hospital thought it was prostate cancer. I shot on medication and as I went into post-production, I started healing myself. I met a few alternate healers who told me that I was hating on my own masculinity and the prostate gland is really the seat of the male hormone. In retrospect, I think in the making of the film, I sort of went through what Manda (the granddaughter) did. I could feel what Manda was feeling, what Ajji was feeling, because I was in so much pain, and it probably manifested on screen.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n环保督察对经济影响有限 京津冀冬季限产影响更明显--兴业研究\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'环保督察对经济影响有限\\', \\'京津冀冬季限产影响更明显兴业研究\\']\\n-SUMMARY

kicking off on Thursday (October 19). But as people across India let off fireworks for the celebration, there were fewer to be seen in and around Delhi. The supreme court has put a temporary ban on the sale of crackers in the capital, because officials are worried they could send already high pollution levels skyrocketing. Air quality began worsening in the city ahead of the festival this week prompting the government to order diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down. While emergency services like hospitals are exempt, many well-off residents are now running on back up generators. The measures will stay in place until March to prevent pollution levels from rising further. Choking smog in Delhi has become a major public policy issue in the past few years as residents become more aware of the life-threatening effects of breathing dirty air which is often ranked among the world\\'s most toxic.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nData Dive: CO2 emissions on the decline\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'emissions\\', \\'data\\', \\'millions\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'co2\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'dive\\', \\'decline\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nS.African prosecutors give Zuma Nov. 30 deadline to make presentations in corruption case\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'prosecutors\\', \\'filed\\', \\'court\\', \\'deadline\\', \\'reinstate\\', \\'presentations\\', \\'jacob\\', \\'south\\', \\'npa\\', \\'nov\\', \\'president\\', \\'safrican\\', \\'prosecuting\\', \\'charges\\', \\'corruption\\', \\'case\\', \\'30\\', \\'zuma\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has given President Jacob Zuma until Nov. 30 to make submissions before it decides whether to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against Zuma before he became president, it said on Friday.\\nSouth Africa\\'s President Jacob Zuma addresses an anti-crime meeting in Elsie\\'s River, Cape Town, South Africa May 30, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Mike HutchingsThe NPA said any further representations by Zuma should relate to issues not previously considered by authorities.\\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal last Friday upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate the charges filed against Zuma.\\nThey were set aside in April 2009 by the then-head of the prosecuting authority, paving the way for Zuma to run for president later that year.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has given President Jacob Zuma until Nov. 30 to make submissions before it decides whether to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against Zuma before he became president, it said on Friday.\\n\\nSouth Africa\\'s President Jacob Zuma addresses an anti-crime meeting in Elsie\\'s River, Cape Town, South Africa May 30, 2017.

(Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.\\n\\nThe logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato\\n\\nThese deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.\\n\\nAt The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.\\n\\n“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.\\n\\nThe result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.\\n\\nThere are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.\\n\\nCORRECTION AHEAD?\\n\\nYet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.\\n\\nJust 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.\\n\\nThe drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.\\n\\nWall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]\\n\\nBut Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.\\n\\n“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.\\n\\nSOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED\\n\\nIncreasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.\\n\\nSo far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.\\n\\nSoftBank is in the next week expected to finalise a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.\\n\\n“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”\\n\\nSoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.\\n\\nSecondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.\\n\\nThe flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.\\n\\n“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.\\n\\nMeal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.\\n\\nSnap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of messaging app Snapchat, is down more than 10 percent from its IPO price in March.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nKenyan police say four people killed during opposition demonstrations in past two weeks\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'opposition\\', \\'demonstrations\\', \\'violence\\', \\'supreme\\', \\'weeks\\', \\'votethe\\', \\'killed\\', \\'presidential\\', \\'vote\\', \\'past\\', \\'result\\', \\'election\\', \\'set\\', \\'kenyan\\', \\'say\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s police said on Friday that four people had died as result of police intervention during opposition protests in the past two weeks, amid concerns violence will break out in next week’s repeat presidential vote.\\nThe re-run of the Aug. 8 presidential election annulled by the Supreme Court is set for Oct. 26.\\nBut opposition leader Raila Odinga has pulled out, alleging a failure to improve oversight of the election, casting doubt on how the vote will proceed.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s police said on Friday that four people had died as result of police intervention during opposition protests in the past two weeks, amid concerns violence will break out in next week’s repeat presidential vote.\\n\\nThe re-run of the Aug. 8 presidential election annulled by the Supreme Court is set for Oct. 26.

The first novel in the new \"Book of Dust\" trilogy, hitting bookshops on Thursday (October 19). It\\'s been 17 years since Pullman released \"The Amber Spyglass\", the last book in his globally-acclaimed \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy. But now he has returned to the realm of alethiometers, daemons and windows into other worlds with \"La Belle Sauvage\" - and that\\'s given some people cause to celebrate. Take for example this midnight party at the Waterstones store on London\\'s Tottenham Court Road, one of hundreds of events being held in shops across the UK. The 150 guests here treated to themed cocktails, food and readings - and a chance to be among the first to get their hands on the new book. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JACK TINDALE, WATERSTONES CUSTOMER, SAYING: \"I remember reading this when I was a young teenager, sort of 11, 12 years old, and very strangely you just come along and you feel giddy and like you are a teenager again. It\\'s very strange.\" Seventeen years worth of anticipation means \"La Belle Sauvage\" is likely to be one this year\\'s biggest sellers. Early on Thursday morning it was topping Amazon\\'s bestseller charts, and Waterstones is expecting big sales too. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ALICE CHAPPELL, WATERSTONES BOOKSELLER, SAYING: \"This book is hotly anticipated.

A estatal deverá obter o dinheiro para o pagamento com uma oferta de ações que reduzirá a União a uma fatia minoritária na companhia.\\n\\nOs recursos de privatizações devem ajudar o governo federal a tentar cumprir suas metas orçamentárias.\\n\\nPedrosa disse ainda que os planos para a privatização preveem também limites à participação de investidores na Eletrobras.\\n\\n“Estamos investindo (na ideia de privatização) para trazer resultado e criar uma corporação... com uma limitação, em que nenhum acionista tenha mais de 10 por cento do bloco de controle, uma empresa com lógica privada”, disse Pedrosa.\\n\\nO diretor-geral da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), Romeu Rufino, também presente no debate, disse que para o órgão regulador é indiferente se uma empresa como a Eletrobras tem controle estatal ou privado, mas ressaltou que ineficiências da companhia nos últimos anos têm punido os consumidores com custos mais elevados.\\n\\nEle deu como exemplos o atraso na entrega de obras devido à crise financeira enfrentada pela empresa.\\n\\n“O grupo Eletrobras assumiu compromissos que não conseguiu entregar, por várias dificuldades.

O processo de mudança nos contratos desses empreendimentos tem sido chamado de “descotização”.\\n\\nRufino defendeu que o governo precisa ter cuidado nesse processo para evitar uma forte elevação das tarifas.\\n\\n“A descotização, isoladamente, não vai na direção da modicidade tarifária.

Ela se tornou uma agregadora de custos... a privatização, com a descotização, aumenta a tarifa... mas os ganhos compensam tudo isso, não precisa fazer nenhuma conta, só de acabar com esse ciclo vicioso de aumento de custos”, afirmou ele, também presente na Fiesp.\\n\\nO governo tem falado em concluir todo o processo de privatização da elétrica federal até o final do primeiro semestre de 2018.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCommentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'united\\', \\'council\\', \\'iran\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'iranian\\', \\'security\\', \\'jcpoa\\', \\'states\\', \\'sanctions\\', \\'risk\\', \\'threats\\', \\'break\\', \\'deal\\', \\'commentary\\', \\'europe\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nIf the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.\\nThe Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program.\\nAny participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief.\\nThe U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.\\nA deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nDonald Trump is approaching a crucial deadline on his Iran policy. On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.\\n\\nDonald Trump with European Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels, May 25, 2017. European leaders want the U.S. president to continue certifying that Iran is complying with a multinational nuclear deal. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\\n\\nIran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nThat would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.\\n\\nThe president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.\\n\\nThe Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.\\n\\nThe JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.\\n\\nIronically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPeter Apps: Uber\\'s London fight a sign of tech battles to come\\n\\nPeter Van Buren: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq\\n\\nOnce the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.\\n\\nEurope would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.\\n\\nEurope would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.\\n\\nOther countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.\\n\\nAt the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nIndia says ready for stronger U.S. ties after Tillerson endorsement\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'united\\', \\'china\\', \\'ties\\', \\'tillerson\\', \\'endorsement\\', \\'states\\', \\'indian\\', \\'future\\', \\'stronger\\', \\'spokesman\\', \\'ready\\', \\'international\\', \\'chinas\\', \\'india\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India stood ready to further strengthen ties with the United States, the government said on Friday, after U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson vowed to dramatically expand cooperation as a way to counter China’s influence in Asia.\\nAn Indian foreign ministry spokesman said Tillerson had made an important speech on the future of India-U.S. relations and India looked forward to detailed discussions next week.\\nIndia warned that China’s plans for a modern-day “Silk Road” could create an “unsustainable debt burden” for countries.\\nThe ministry spokesman said India agreed with Tillerson’s call for a “rules-based” international order that is seen as under risk from China’s assertive posture in Asia.\\nHe brought out its various strengths and highlighted our shared commitment to a rule-based international order,” the Indian spokesman said.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India stood ready to further strengthen ties with the United States, the government said on Friday, after U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson vowed to dramatically expand cooperation as a way to counter China’s influence in Asia.\\n\\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives to deliver remarks on Relationship with India for the Next Century at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, U.S., October 18, 2017.

SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties.\\n\\nIn 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted.\\n\\nThat’s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.\\n\\n“The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,” it concluded.\\n\\nOnly 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.\\n\\nMany of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home.\\n\\nAlthough Afghan trainees are considered “high risk” because of their military training and “fighting age,” SIGAR said it was “not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts” involving them.\\n\\nIn response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend.\\n\\nThat has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away. “If a student absconds, it affects his unit,” one Afghan officer told investigators.\\n\\nBetween 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nGreggio, prezzi si preparano a chiusura settimanale in ribasso su prese beneficio\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'si\\', \\'preparano\\', \\'su\\', \\'di\\', \\'del\\', \\'le\\', \\'beneficio\\', \\'il\\', \\'petrolio\\', \\'settimana\\', \\'sul\\', \\'prezzi\\', \\'chiusura\\', \\'ha\\', \\'ribasso\\', \\'greggio\\', \\'sono\\', \\'settimanale\\', \\'prese\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nL\\'impianto petrolifero e del gas di Mellitah, in Libia.\\nREUTERS/Hani Amara** Intorno alle 12,45 il futures sul greggio Brent tratta in calo di 35 cent a 56,88 dollari il barile e il derivato sul U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) arretra a 50,88 dollari il barile, in ribasso di 41 cent.\\n** “Ci sono un po’ di prese di beneficio”, commenta Olivier Jakob, chief strategist della società di consulenza Petromatrix.\\n** “Il mercato ha trattato in un range stretto per tutta la settimana senza vere accelerazioni”, ha aggiunto.\\n** Le esportazioni di greggio dal Kurdistan iracheno verso il porto turco di Ceyhan stanno proseguendo nella media oggi di 216.000 barili giornalieri rispetto all‘ammontare solito di 600.000, secondo una fonte del settore.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLONDRA (Reuters) - Quotazioni in flessione per il petrolio sulla piazza londinese dopo i guadagni negli scambi asiatici: i prezzi sono impostati per chiudere la settimana in ribasso per effetti dei realizzi nonostante le tensioni in Medio Oriente abbiano frenato le forniture.\\n\\nL\\'impianto petrolifero e del gas di Mellitah, in Libia.

Andi Rukman Karumpa, secretary general of the National Construction Services Association, estimated 80 percent of public projects are still handled by SOEs, using their own funding or the state budget.\\n\\nSUBWAY, AIRPORT LINK TAKE SHAPE\\n\\nWorld Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in July SOEs had an advantage with government backing and in navigating red tape. But “for Indonesia to continue to have a thriving economy, you need to actively encourage private sector involvement”.\\n\\nThe World Bank in its October economic review said Indonesia needed to spend $1.5 trillion to catch up with other comparable emerging economies. Even if it invested at the rate promised, it would take 20 years to match the average infrastructure stock of emerging markets, the Bank said.\\n\\nThe government allocated around $72 billion in infrastructure-related spending up to 2017, including capital injections to SOEs, and wants parliament to approve $30 billion more next year.\\n\\nAlthough Indonesia has won funding from multinational lenders such as the World Bank, as well as China and Japan, the projects mostly went to SOEs. They include a $4.5 billion Jakarta to Bandung high-speed rail link funded by China Development Bank, which will be built by a consortium of Chinese and local SOEs.\\n\\nKarumpa at the construction association wants the government to double the minimum project size project that SOEs can take to 100 billion rupiah ($7.38 million), so private firms can at least take over smaller publicly funded projects.\\n\\nFor most Indonesians, just getting basic infrastructure, whoever builds it, is what matters.\\n\\nAfter a string of delays, traffic-clogged Jakarta is due to finally have a mass rapid transit system, the first for the G20 nation, in 2019 and a rail link to the city’s airport is set to launch next year.\\n\\nJapanese companies, including Obayashi Corp (1802.T), are working with state-run builder Wijaya Karya (WIKA.JK) and private PT Jaya Konstruksi Manggala Pratama (JKON.JK) on the MRT.\\n\\nThe airport railway is being built by two SOEs, PT Kereta Api Indonesia and PT Angkasa Pura II.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nPresidente da Oi diz que empresa está pronta para assembleia de credores marcada para 2a-feira\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'que\\', \\'diz\\', \\'da\\', \\'presidente\\', \\'está\\', \\'schroeder\\', \\'pronta\\', \\'marcada\\', \\'por\\', \\'para\\', \\'mas\\', \\'reunião\\', \\'segundafeira\\', \\'empresa\\', \\'oi\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBRASÍLIA (Reuters) -

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.\\n\\nA Libyan fighter at the frontline of the fight against Islamic State militants in Ghiza Bahriya district in Sirte, Libya November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny\\n\\nThe aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.\\n\\nIn contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPeter Van Buren: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider\\'s guide to disaster management\\n\\nBryce Covert: The tax reform that Republicans are missing\\n\\nLight arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.\\n\\nA member of the Syrian Democratic Forces aims his gun during the battle with Islamic State\\'s fighters in the old city of Raqqa, Syria, August 19, 2017. REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra\\n\\nRelaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.\\n\\nWashington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.\\n\\nThe civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington\\'s Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.\\n\\nAccording to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.\\n\\nThe question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.\\n\\n(Daniel R.

Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.\\n\\nVW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nGoverno quer limitar a 10% participação de investidor no controle da Eletrobras, diz ministro\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'diz\\', \\'da\\', \\'controle\\', \\'millions\\', \\'limitar\\', \\'ministro\\', \\'investidor\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'participação\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'warning\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'eletrobras\\', \\'quer\\', \\'turn\\', \\'governo\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nKonzernumbau brockt Ericsson hohen Verlust ein\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'week\\', \\'hohen\\', \\'ein\\', \\'konzernumbau\\', \\'stockholm\\', \\'package\\', \\'verlust\\', \\'business\\', \\'strongfile\\', \\'ericsson\\', \\'search\\', \\'ahead\\', \\'seen\\', \\'reutersbob\\', \\'brockt\\', \\'oct\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nThe exterior of Ericsson\\'s headquarters is seen in Stockholm April 30, 2009.\\nREUTERS/Bob Strong/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD PACKAGE SEARCH BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD 17 OCT FOR ALL IMAGES\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nThe exterior of Ericsson\\'s headquarters is seen in Stockholm April 30, 2009.

The U.S. president’s decertification of Tehran’s compliance will be well noted in Pyongyang, giving North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a credible excuse for refusing to negotiate with Washington.\\n\\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un guides a multiple-rocket launching drill in this undated photo released by North Korea\\'s Korean Central News Agency. KCNA via REUTERS/File Photo\\n\\nThe U.S.-North Korea situation is becoming more fraught as both sides attempt to pile on pressure, pushing prospects for talks further away.\\n\\nJust two months ago, I argued that Americans needed to put North Korea’s missile tests in perspective. (“Yes, they’re worrying. But the U.S. mainland is not in imminent danger.”) Now I’m slightly less sanguine: either side could make a catastrophic miscalculation while tensions persist. Even before Trump’s decision on Iran, the prospects for negotiations were diminishing.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nScott Lemieux: Blame the Constitution for Trump\\'s undemocratic executive orders\\n\\nPaul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit\\n\\nFor one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.\\n\\nInsults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.\\n\\nSecond, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.\\n\\nThis reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.\\n\\nThis brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\nThe agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.\\n\\nThe agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\\n\\nTrump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.\\n\\nCrucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.\\n\\nTrump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.\\n\\nThis is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.\\n\\nOn top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.\\n\\nMoreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.\\n\\nA negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n母子ひき逃げ、男児死亡\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'母子ひき逃げ男児死亡\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'app\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nAustrian coalition talks set to begin, far right likely partner\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'austrian\\', \\'kurz\\', \\'likely\\', \\'talks\\', \\'president\\', \\'party\\', \\'begin\\', \\'austria\\', \\'far\\', \\'kern\\', \\'partner\\', \\'coalition\\', \\'set\\', \\'fpo\\', \\'vienna\\', \\'leader\\', \\'right\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nAustria\\'s President Alexander Van der Bellen receives leader of the People\\'s Party (OeVP) Sebastian Kurz at his office in Vienna, Austria, October 20, 2017.\\nHe has accused his rivals of holding talks on an SPO-FPO, “red-blue” coalition (Haiti).\\nBut FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache poured cold water on the idea of a “coalition of losers” in an interview with tabloid Oesterreich.\\n“If he were to invite us (to hold coalition talks), we would accept the invitation,” he said, adding that in such a case the FPO would not hold parallel talks with the SPO.\\nKurz has hinted at being prepared to consider it if Kern is replaced as leader by Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nVIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s president gave the green light to conservative leader Sebastian Kurz on Friday to form a government, but Kurz gave little away about his coalition plans, leaving a tie-up with the far right the most likely outcome.\\n\\nAustria\\'s President Alexander Van der Bellen and leader of the People\\'s Party (OeVP) Sebastian Kurz shake hands after a media statement in Vienna, Austria, October 20, 2017.

There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.\\n\\nA photo illustration shows the Uber app on a mobile phone in central London, September 22, 2017. London authorities have stripped Uber of its license to operate in the British capital. REUTERS/Toby Melville\\n\\nUntil relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.\\n\\nThat is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPeter Van Buren: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq\\n\\nSamuel R. Bagenstos: How Congress is hacking away at disability rights\\n\\nOther cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.\\n\\nPolitical perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.\\n\\nThat assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.\\n\\nSuch scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.\\n\\nGetting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.\\n\\nInstead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.\\n\\nThe decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.\\n\\nFor the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.\\n\\nIncreasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.\\n\\nTechnology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.\\n\\nIn many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.\\n\\nThe London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.\\n\\nEarly signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.\\n\\nWhat Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.\\n\\nGiant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nViewsroom: Wells Fargo stagecoach hits a ditch\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'subscribe\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'stagecoach\\', \\'undermines\\', \\'recovery\\', \\'million\\', \\'wells\\', \\'hits\\', \\'shippingindustry\\', \\'steered\\', \\'viewsroom\\', \\'woes\\', \\'ditch\\', \\'prompt\\', \\'fargo\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nSubscribe to the Viewsroom in iTunesThe bank that steered clear of the financial crisis breaks down after creating 2 million fake accounts.\\nNew evidence undermines Donald Trump’s claims few benefit from the U.S. economic recovery.\\nAnd why Hanjin’s corporate capsize may prompt attempts to fix to shipping-industry woes.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to the Viewsroom in iTunes\\n\\nThe bank that steered clear of the financial crisis breaks down after creating 2 million fake accounts.

Macy’s said holiday hiring was “off to a great start”.\\n\\nBut staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand.\\n\\nThe staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.\\n\\n“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.\\n\\nHer clients include Lowe’s Cos Inc, Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs.\\n\\nU.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the “gig economy” and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool.\\n\\nThe hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nIn comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month.\\n\\nThe job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.\\n\\n“There just aren’t enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,” the site’s chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.\\n\\nNO BONUS\\n\\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics’ JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs.\\n\\nRecruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more.\\n\\n“The jobs have become bigger,” Manpower Group’s Hassett said. “A manager will do more at the stores, they’ll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to.”\\n\\nWal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.\\n\\n“We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,” said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart’s senior manager of corporate communications.\\n\\nJ.C. Penney said it was introducing paid time off for part-time hourly associates, starting from early 2018, to entice seasonal hires to stay beyond the holiday season.\\n\\nHigher up the food chain, recruiters also point to bonuses that have lagged other industries as harming efforts to draw in and keep talented regional managers or heads of business lines.\\n\\n“They (retailers) are paying lower bonuses and some companies have paid lower bonuses for a couple of years,” talent acquisition firm Korn Ferry’s retail expert Craig Rowley said.\\n\\nAn analysis by Korn Ferry of 40 big North American retailers showed that 73 percent paid little to no bonuses to senior executives for their performance in 2016. Thirty five percent paid no bonus, up from 25 percent last year.\\n\\n“It’s the perception of where retail as an industry is going,” Manpower’s Hassett said. “So when the brick-and-mortar retail is really struggling, at that executive level, people are concerned about staying in retail.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nEl patriotismo de banderas refleja el respaldo a Rajoy respecto a Cataluña\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'respecto\\', \\'rajoy\\', \\'refleja\\', \\'patriotismo\\', \\'respaldo\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'el\\', \\'massive\\', \\'banderas\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'cataluña\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nHealth & Fitness News\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'outbreak\\', \\'health\\', \\'meningitis\\', \\'told\\', \\'fitness\\', \\'ustoxic\\', \\'haze\\', \\'delhi\\', \\'festival\\', \\'toxic\\', \\'world\\', \\'times\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nMore HeadlinesProsecutors seek pharmacist\\'s conviction over U.S. meningitis outbreak BOSTON A federal prosecutor on Friday told jurors that a Massachusetts pharmacist, charged with murder for his role in a deadly 2012 U.S. meningitis outbreak, acted with a \"depraved heart\" while knowingly producing non-sterile drugs.\\nU.S.,Toxic firecracker haze darkens Indian capital after festival of lights NEW DELHI Air pollution in New Delhi hit 18 times the healthy limit on Friday under a thick, toxic haze after a night of fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali - despite a court-ordered ban on their sales.\\n| Environment, World,\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMore Headlines\\n\\nProsecutors seek pharmacist\\'s conviction over U.S. meningitis outbreak BOSTON A federal prosecutor on Friday told jurors that a Massachusetts pharmacist, charged with murder for his role in a deadly 2012 U.S. meningitis outbreak, acted with a \"depraved heart\" while knowingly producing non-sterile drugs.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.\\n\\nMitch Golden, portfolio manager for hedge fund Greenlight Masters, poses following an interview at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\\n\\n“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.\\n\\nHis approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn\\'s $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2s8LJrm\\'\\n\\nGreenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.\\n\\nIt is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.\\n\\nGolden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.\\n\\nHe can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.\\n\\n“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.\\n\\nTo beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.\\n\\n“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”\\n\\nBrian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”\\n\\nThe native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.\\n\\nMitch Golden, portfolio manager for hedge fund Greenlight Masters, speaks during an interview at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Photo taken May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\\n\\nSometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.\\n\\nEarlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.\\n\\nPLAYGROUND CHATS\\n\\nOn Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.\\n\\nSlideshow (2 Images)\\n\\nUnlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.\\n\\nIn 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.\\n\\nHe has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.\\n\\nGolden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.\\n\\n“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.\\n\\nGreenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.\\n\\nGolden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.\\n\\nAfter many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.\\n\\n“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nS.Africa\\'s Group Five allows Greenbay\\'s $116 mln bid to lapse\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'safricas\\', \\'assets\\', \\'bid\\', \\'group\\', \\'south\\', \\'allows\\', \\'offer\\', \\'116\\', \\'undervalued\\', \\'firm\\', \\'lapse\\', \\'shares\\', \\'tumbled\\', \\'greenbays\\', \\'greenbay\\', \\'rand\\', \\'mln\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -

Years before Donald Trump began promising to bring back good manufacturing jobs by getting tough with U.S. trade partners, such jobs have already been on the rise, largely thanks to foreign companies now cast as villains in Trump’s narrative.\\n\\nReuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.\\n\\nMore recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2sWkzTB\\'\\n\\nNow foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.\\n\\nThe U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.\\n\\nThe tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.\\n\\nThe southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.\\n\\nPOSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY\\n\\nThe courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.\\n\\nFew places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.\\n\\nGerman carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.\\n\\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.\\n\\n“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.\\n\\nIts Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.\\n\\nBut the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014.

We need more trade agreements, not less.”\\n\\nGraham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).\\n\\nThe now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.\\n\\nMercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.\\n\\nUp the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.\\n\\nLocal development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.\\n\\nClaire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.\\n\\n“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”\\n\\n(1 euro = $1.1350)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n苹果iPhone X闪亮登场 功能新、价位高\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'press\\', \\'苹果iphone\\', \\'x闪亮登场\\', \\'mac\\', \\'codehttpsreutrs2vurxht\\', \\'ctrlc\\', \\'功能新价位高\\', \\'device\\', \\'windows\\', \\'url\\', \\'copy\\', \\'longpress\\', \\'mobile\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPress CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the codehttps://reut.rs/2vUrXht\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPress CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code\\n\\nhttps://reut.rs/2vUrXht\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTop News Headlines\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'worried\\', \\'agency\\', \\'protection\\', \\'york\\', \\'headlines\\', \\'seen\\', \\'series\\', \\'undercut\\', \\'proposed\\', \\'policy\\', \\'lawmakers\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation\\'s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation\\'s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nEU\\'s Juncker says assumes won\\'t end up with \\'no deal\\' on Brexit\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'details\\', \\'union\\', \\'juncker\\', \\'wont\\', \\'president\\', \\'end\\', \\'assumes\\', \\'european\\', \\'eus\\', \\'brussels\\', \\'jeanclaude\\', \\'leaders\\', \\'commission\\', \\'deal\\', \\'brexit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday he did not believe that Britain would crash out of the European Union with no Brexit deal.\\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker briefs the media during a European Union leaders summit meeting in Brussels, Belgium, October 19, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Dario PignatelliEU leaders will meet on Friday to discuss their response to British Prime Minister Theresa May’s appeal to move to the next phase of Brexit negotiations and are expected to agree that there needs to be more progress in talks on the divorce terms.\\n“We have some details but we don’t have all the details we need...

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\\n\\nThe ECB’s Single Supervisory Mechanism is due to come up with a new set of rules by March for how much money banks should set aside against their stock of bad loans, a thorny issue in Italy, where lenders are sitting on more than a quarter of the euro zone’s 865 billion euros ($1.0 trillion) unpaid loans.\\n\\nBut the sources said the strong Italian backlash against the SSM’s latest proposals on how lenders should deal with new bad loans meant supervisors were having to reassess their approach to tackling already soured debts.\\n\\n“There is a serious risk that the SSM’s coming proposal will be too soft,” said one of the sources, all of whom are close to or on the ECB’s decision making body.\\n\\nThe ECB declined to comment.\\n\\nThe main worry for Italy is that its banks, if asked to set aside more money, will curb lending. Some may need to raise capital - a task that has eluded Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two regional lenders in recent months, triggering state interventions.\\n\\nWith the new guidelines not due out until the first quarter of next year, no proposal has yet been sent to the ECB’s supervisory board.\\n\\nBut SSM staff have been working on four scenarios modeled on the current guidelines on new non-performing loans (NPLs), which give banks seven years to provide for credit backed by collateral and two years for unsecured debt, another source said.\\n\\nOne of these options would require banks to start building up provisions for their legacy loans straight away, albeit gradually.\\n\\nA more generous one would stop the clock for one or two years, effectively giving banks until 2021 and 2026 for hitting their targets.\\n\\nThey are now all in jeopardy.\\n\\n“Now even the most generous scenario might appear too strict,” the source said. “It’s all in flux.”\\n\\nThe ECB’s guidelines will also be influenced by a legislative proposal that the European Commission is preparing in parallel and could include measures on provisions, the sources said.\\n\\nThis is to avoid any risk of clashing with Brussels after the Italian head of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, openly questioned the ECB’s authority on the matter and raised the specter of an unprecedented dispute between the institutions.\\n\\nIn a most extreme outcome, which one source said the SSM is likely to resist, supervisors would stop short of setting rules for all banks in the euro zone, merely publishing criteria that could be applied differently across firms and countries.\\n\\nSEEKING SUPPORT\\n\\nThe publicity received by the backlash meant any new proposal was set to be subject to extra scrutiny by the ECB’s Governing Council, which includes national central bank governors and approves SSM’s decisions.\\n\\nHere Italy hopes to receive support from other countries with heavy bad loan burdens such as Greece, Portugal and Spain.\\n\\nThe sources said that will not be easy as these countries had spent or were saving political capital at the ECB for domestic issues, such as Greece’s latest bailout review, Portugal’s sale of state-owned Novo Banco and risks associated with the Catalan government’s independence push, the sources said.\\n\\n“They are not keen to make any fuss,” one of the sources said.\\n\\nWhile the co-ordinated backlash by Tajani, the Italian government, central bank and banking lobby was also likely to result in some changes to the guidelines on new bad loans, under consultation until Dec. 8, an overhaul was unlikely as it would dent the SSM’s credibility, the sources said.\\n\\nBut they stressed the new rules already allow for flexibility as banks are allowed to deviate from the prescribed timelines if they can explain why, for example by showing they can recoup some of the money.\\n\\nRatings agency S&P Global expects Italian banks to sell 100-120 billion euro in problem loan sales by 2019 and said offloading large amounts at current prices could lead to some needing fresh capital.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nDestroyed artefacts \\'cloned\\' for Tokyo exhibition\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'tokyo\\', \\'artefacts\\', \\'used\\', \\'technology\\', \\'visitor\\', \\'destroyed\\', \\'cloned\\', \\'exhibition\\', \\'japanese\\', \\'statue\\', \\'yearold\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'team\\', \\'saying\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) PRESIDENT OF FOUNDATION FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE AND ART RESEARCH, MASAYUKI MIYASAKO, SAYING: \"It has been perceived as counterfeiting and a crime.\\nBut by controlling them strictly, we believe we can create clones in order to show them to more people all year round.\\nI hope people can enjoy and find inner peace through culture.\"\\n(SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) 63 YEAR-OLD VISITOR, YUTAKA YAMAZEKI, SAYING: \"These artefacts will go through erosion over time, so the technology that allows these items to be protected will be important..\" The team hopes the art cloning technology can be used to protect cultural artefacts from being smuggled or destroyed.\\nVisitors to Tokyo University of Arts museum can see the \\'clones\\' until October 26.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nIt was thought that artefacts like Afghanistan\\'s Bamiyan Buddhas were lost forever Destroyed by the Taliban in 2001, the ancient statues were blasted with guns and dynamite But \\'cloning\\' technology developed in Japan could bring them back to life And allow new audiences around the world to enjoy and learn from them.

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study has warned that deadly heat could cause \\'devastation\\' in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh if carbon emissions are not reduced. REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta\\n\\nWe need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.\\n\\nThe list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.\\n\\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.\\n\\nDeterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.\\n\\nNor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.\\n\\nNuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.\\n\\nWolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.\\n\\nThe world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.\\n\\nA study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nGregory Scruggs: There\\'s a way to reduce the wildfire toll. We won\\'t like it.\\n\\nSeyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran\\n\\nWe’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.\\n\\nThese and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.\\n\\nPost-war generations, especially the “boomers” (my own) have let the good times roll for too long. If that sounds unduly pessimistic in the face of continuing advances in many fields, neglectful of the fact that bad stuff always happens but the world continues, then reflect on the triggers – the list could be expanded - whose pulling could precipitate disaster. These concerns are no longer the subject of academic discussion or obscure papers from the World Bank or the United Nations. They are real, present and above all known to us. Why should our young forgive us if we do not take them seriously?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nKelly \\'stunned\\' by congresswoman\\'s response to Trump...\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'trump\\', \\'stunned\\', \\'congresswomans\\', \\'wilson\\', \\'white\\', \\'thing\\', \\'kelly\\', \\'staff\\', \\'wrong\\', \\'went\\', \\'response\\', \\'widow\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The White House was \"stunned\" by claims by Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson that President Donald Trump was \"insensitive\" during a phone call to the widow of a fallen soldier, Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday (October 19).\\nKelly, who lost his own son in Afghanistan, criticized the politicization of the call, which he described as being \"the most difficult thing you can imagine.\"\\nTrump was calling the widow of Sergeant La David T.

The U.S. Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the post-crisis bank resolution regime, as some Republicans urge. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it’s ditched.\\n\\nU.S. President Donald Trump (L) arrives with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prior to signing financial services executive orders at the Treasury Department in Washington, U.S., April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\\n\\nWhat’s known as orderly liquidation authority was established to avoid confusion if a complex financial institution fails, like Lehman Brothers did a decade ago. Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp the power to resolve bank holding companies, systemically important non-banks and other financial firms, and set up a fund to pay for the associated costs. The FDIC would initially borrow from the Treasury, and recoup the expenses with a fee imposed on big banks.\\n\\nSome congressional Republicans decry this arrangement as another taxpayer-funded bailout. They have introduced bills to eliminate OLA and replace it with an improved bankruptcy code. The criticisms prompted President Donald Trump in April to order Treasury to review the OLA, and assess whether bankruptcy was a better method.\\n\\nThe U.S. debate ignores the global nature of big banks and the role international regulators play. The FDIC-supported method would resolve a firm at the holding company level, eliminating the need for each division - including overseas units - to have their own wind-down plans. Overseas watchdogs would defer to U.S. regulators and work in close cooperation with them. Bankruptcy judges don’t have those relationships and the process, even with improvements, would be too slow to handle the fast-paced chaos of a large, failing bank.\\n\\nOverseas regulators have smartly worked to get ahead of the decision, warning that without OLA, U.S. banks’ overseas subsidiaries could be subject to higher capital requirements, restructuring and ringfencing. Wall Street also supports maintaining the liquidation authority. Despite Trump’s threats to gut Dodd-Frank, Steven Mnuchin’s Treasury Department so far has been level-headed in its recommendations for revising bank regulations and rules overseeing capital markets. The threat from global watchdogs is another reason to discount the odds of a major rollback of financial rules.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLas fuerzas iraquíes logran el control de la provincia de Kirkuk tras choques con kurdos\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'kurdos\\', \\'tras\\', \\'provincia\\', \\'iraquíes\\', \\'las\\', \\'fuerzas\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'logran\\', \\'el\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'kirkuk\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'la\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nToxic firecracker haze darkens Indian capital after festival of lights\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'capital\\', \\'court\\', \\'supreme\\', \\'firecrackers\\', \\'indian\\', \\'darkens\\', \\'firecracker\\', \\'level\\', \\'air\\', \\'haze\\', \\'lights\\', \\'delhi\\', \\'festival\\', \\'toxic\\', \\'diwali\\', \\'quality\\', \\'pollution\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Air pollution in New Delhi hit 18 times the healthy limit on Friday under a thick, toxic haze after a night of fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali - despite a court-ordered ban on their sales.\\nAir quality usually worsens in New Delhi ahead of Diwali, the festival of lights, and the Supreme Court temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers, aiming to lessen the risk to health.\\nBut many still lit fireworks across the capital late into the night, either using old stocks or buying them from neighboring states.\\nApart from the firecracker ban, the Supreme Court also ordered diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down to try to reduce the pollution.\\nBut pollution levels were better than at last year’s Diwali when crop burning in nearby states and firecrackers combined.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Air pollution in New Delhi hit 18 times the healthy limit on Friday under a thick, toxic haze after a night of fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali - despite a court-ordered ban on their sales.\\n\\nResidents of the sprawling Indian capital, which already ranks among the world’s most polluted cities, complained of eyes watering and aggravated coughs as levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that reaches deep into the lungs, rose alarmingly.\\n\\nAir quality usually worsens in New Delhi ahead of Diwali, the festival of lights, and the Supreme Court temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers, aiming to lessen the risk to health.\\n\\nBut many still lit fireworks across the capital late into the night, either using old stocks or buying them from neighboring states.\\n\\nSome environment activists said the court order was poorly enforced and firecrackers were still available to celebrate one of north India’s biggest festivals.\\n\\n“Breathe nitrate and ammonia, home grown, hand made!” said environmentalist Vimlendu Jha in a Twitter post calling for city authorities to declare a public emergency.\\n\\nA man chews sugarcane on a bridge during smoggy morning in New Delhi, India, October 20, 2017.

On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.\\n\\nBut since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.\\n\\nThat is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.\\n\\nWith the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.\\n\\nThis followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.\\n\\nOn Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.\\n\\nBankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.\\n\\nSome in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.\\n\\n“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.\\n\\n“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move.

A $1,000 investment on the day former CEO Jeff Immelt started his tenure would be worth $1,006.38 today. Immelt stepped down Aug. 1.\\n\\nAs proof of GE’s new approach to performance, outgoing CFO Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.\\n\\n“That sense of accountability has to start with me,” he said. “We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me.”\\n\\nGE’s poor financial performance in the third quarter showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE’s highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark “robust dialog,” he said and shedding some of the 18 directors was “being examined.”\\n\\nGE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\\n\\nGE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.\\n\\nGE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.\\n\\nGE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said. Industrial cash flow from operations fell mainly ”because of lower power volume, resulting in lower earnings and higher inventory.”\\n\\nProfit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.\\n\\nCash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.\\n\\nRevenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHGE.N).\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nEspanha planeja forçar realização de eleições na Catalunha em janeiro, diz oposição\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'forçar\\', \\'eleições\\', \\'espanha\\', \\'diz\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'em\\', \\'catalunha\\', \\'massive\\', \\'planeja\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'janeiro\\', \\'warning\\', \\'realização\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'oposição\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n俄罗斯央行：副总裁称下周政策会议上将考虑降息的“多种选项”\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'turn\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'俄罗斯央行副总裁称下周政策会议上将考虑降息的多种选项\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nU.S. Senate passes budget bill crucial to GOP tax reform push\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'crucial\\', \\'bill\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'pave\\', \\'push\\', \\'president\\', \\'senate\\', \\'taxcut\\', \\'reform\\', \\'support\\', \\'tax\\', \\'way\\', \\'passes\\', \\'pursue\\', \\'gop\\', \\'budget\\', \\'republicans\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPresident Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPresident Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nPhilippine president declares Marawi City liberated\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'militants\\', \\'pivotal\\', \\'proislamic\\', \\'rodrigo\\', \\'president\\', \\'city\\', \\'rebel\\', \\'liberated\\', \\'state\\', \\'declares\\', \\'marawi\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte declares Marawi City liberated from pro-Islamic State militants who have held the heart of the city for 148 days.\\nIt comes after the pivotal killing of two top rebel commanders.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte declares Marawi City liberated from pro-Islamic State militants who have held the heart of the city for 148 days.

Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO - A pump jack used to help lift crude oil from a well in South Texas’ Eagle Ford Shale formation stands idle in Dewitt County, Texas, U.S. on January 13, 2016. REUTERS/Anna Driver/File Photo\\n\\nThe pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.\\n\\nHowever, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.\\n\\nThe market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.\\n\\nFor oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.\\n\\nProducers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.\\n\\nAccording to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.\\n\\nIn total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2rolpok\\'\\n\\nCompared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.\\n\\n“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\\n\\nPrices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.\\n\\nUNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES\\n\\nMorgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.\\n\\nThe increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.\\n\\nAnalysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.\\n\\n“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.\\n\\nSOME NEW PLAYERS\\n\\nIn total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.\\n\\nSome large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.\\n\\nAnalysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.\\n\\n“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.\\n\\nFor a graphic on U.S. shale producer hedges, click here\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nUgandan opposition leader held on murder charge after protests\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'opposition\\', \\'protests\\', \\'rally\\', \\'held\\', \\'museveni\\', \\'near\\', \\'president\\', \\'ugandas\\', \\'besigye\\', \\'murder\\', \\'ugandan\\', \\'charge\\', \\'leader\\', \\'proposed\\', \\'kampala\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nKAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda’s main opposition leader was arrested and charged with murder, police said on Friday, after they broke up a rally organized to protest moves to extend President Yoweri Museveni’s rule.\\nFILE PHOTO: Opposition leader Kizza Besigye speaks during a news conference at his home at the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, February 21, 2016.\\nREUTERS/Goran Tomasevic/File photoKizza Besigye, who has contested and lost four elections against long-time leader Museveni, was detained on Thursday.\\nPolice spokesman Namuwoza said they had been charged with murder, assault, inciting violence and unlawful assembly, and transferred to a prison near the capital Kampala.\\nThere was no immediate reaction to the arrests from Uganda’s opposition.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nKAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda’s main opposition leader was arrested and charged with murder, police said on Friday, after they broke up a rally organized to protest moves to extend President Yoweri Museveni’s rule.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Opposition leader Kizza Besigye speaks during a news conference at his home at the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, February 21, 2016.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\\n\\nBut Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.\\n\\nThe balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.\\n\\nHe is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.\\n\\nThe Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.\\n\\nAfter denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.\\n\\n“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.\\n\\nMost polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.\\n\\nFormer Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.\\n\\nA recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.\\n\\nDistain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.\\n\\nYet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.\\n\\n“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.\\n\\nThe Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.\\n\\nNortham starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.\\n\\n“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.\\n\\nThe strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.\\n\\nShe said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.\\n\\n“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.\\n\\nGillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race.

Agora, eu faço mais uma ressalva aqui, para tirar qualquer pretensão. Temos de consultar as bancadas novamente, como foi feito na primeira vez. Na primeira vez estava tudo ajustado para aprovar, não fosse uma certa irresponsabilidade denunciativa”, disse Temer, fazendo referência à primeira denúncia apresentada contra ele pelo ex-procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, em junho.\\n\\n“Então, vamos fazer uma nova avaliação e verificar se é possível ou não. E tentar aprovar este ano”, acrescentou.\\n\\nO presidente disse ainda que poderá enviar o pacote de medidas de ajuste fiscal, com que a equipe econômica conta para fechar o orçamento, por projeto de lei, e não por medida provisória. Entre os temas estão a suspensão do reajuste dos servidores, a elevação da contribuição previdenciária dos servidores de 11 por cento para 14 por cento e a equiparação do modelo de tributação dos fundos fechados de investimento com o dos fundos abertos.\\n\\n“Se acontecer o que aconteceu agora com o projeto referente ao Banco Central (sobre acordos de leniência), aprovado praticamente em um ou dois dias, pode ser via projeto de lei”, afirmou Temer. “Se isso acontecer, posso até mandar o projeto de lei. Se houver dificuldade, aí sou obrigado a me utilizar da medida provisória”.\\n\\nTemer disse ainda “não ser improvável” que edite uma MP prorrogando mais uma vez a adesão ao Refis. Segundo o presidente, vai haver vetos no projeto, mas esses ainda não estão definidos. O governo tem até 3 de novembro para sancionar o projeto, mas a adesão é apenas até o final deste mês.\\n\\nTRABALHO ESCRAVO\\n\\nTemer ainda confirmou informações publicadas na quinta-feira pela Reuters de que estuda modificações sugeridas pela procuradora-geral da República, Raquel Dodge, na portaria que alterou a definição de trabalho escravo, mas que a norma não deve ser suspensa.\\n\\n“A portaria é do ministro do Trabalho.

REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares/File Photo\\n\\nThe suspension was triggered when PDVSA missed a payment for use of NuStar’s Statia facility on the island of St. Eustatius, according to company documents viewed by Reuters.\\n\\n“We should not load this cargo,” wrote NuStar Vice President James Calvert in response to a loading request, according to one document.\\n\\nNuStar’s refusal to retrieve the oil over what amounts to nearly a year’s worth of monthly fees shows how recurring legal and trade disputes are disrupting PDVSA’s ability to deliver its oil to foreign customers, which generate more than 90 percent of the country’s export revenue.\\n\\nShipping delays and quality concerns also are jeopardizing the OPEC-member country’s crude sales, the lifeblood of its troubled economy.\\n\\nThe suspension comes months after PDVSA had expanded its NuStar storage contract following a payment dispute with Buckeye Partners (BPL.N) over a Bahamas storage facility. Both U.S. firms operate key transit hubs for companies that move oil through the Caribbean.\\n\\nNuStar declined to comment. PDVSA did not respond to a request to comment.\\n\\nNuStar’s refusal and other details of PDVSA’s payment problems emerged after trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] sought to load a cargo of Venezuelan oil held at Statia. Trafigura was the winner of a court-ordered auction of the heavy crude intended to help resolve a separate billing dispute between PDVSA and units of Russian state-run conglomerate Sovcomflot (IPO-SKF.MM).\\n\\nTrafigura declined to comment on the auction or whether it expects to receive the cargo. Sovcomflot also declined to comment.\\n\\nNuStar first sought fees for the stored oil from PDVSA. On Oct. 10, after receiving no response from the Venezuelan firm, NuStar sent a $287,500 invoice to Sigma Navigation, a unit of Sovcomflot. NuStar offered to allow the oil to be loaded by Oct. 20 if payment was made before that date.\\n\\nThat request led to a series of exchanges between representatives of the three companies. In one, a law firm representing Sigma alerted PDVSA’s lawyers that its client was willing to pay the NuStar bill but reserved the right to seek repayment as part of the broader claim, according to documents.\\n\\nSigma’s lawyers also revealed in emails that, according to its talks with NuStar, the U.S. firm was claiming PDVSA owed it another $26 million for accumulated unpaid Statia storage fees.\\n\\nLONG TRIP\\n\\nThe tangled story of the oil cargo at the heart of the dispute began a year ago, when PDVSA sent 550,000 barrels of crude oil to St. Eustatius on tanker NS Columbus rented from Sovcomflot. The oil had been sold to Norway’s Statoil (STL.OL), which planned to retrieve it at Statia.\\n\\nBefore it could get there, Sovcomflot had a St. Maarten court freeze the delivery in hopes of collecting partial payment for shipping fees unpaid by PDVSA. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the court ordered the tanker to discharge its cargo at Statia.\\n\\nTrafigura’s attempts to obtain the oil first were delayed due to force majeure declared by NuStar due to Hurricane Irma, and later over the unpaid bills between PDVSA and NuStar.\\n\\n“We are facing a delay in the payment for the use of such facilities and related services contracted there. PDVSA is doing its best to catch up with outstanding debts, but has not made any special arrangements to cover the storage costs of the relevant tank,” a PDVSA official wrote in an email in October.\\n\\nThe PDVSA official explained that “since June no payment has been made to NuStar,” but also said that a payment schedule was proposed to the U.S. firm in a meeting in September in Caracas, with a first installment of $2.3 million planned for October.\\n\\nAccording to the schedule, 10 percent of the accumulated debt was to be paid from October through December, with a one-time additional payment due in January and the remainder paid off through 10-percent monthly installments.\\n\\nPDVSA has not yet paid the October installment, according to a PDVSA source, prompting NuStar’s refusal to load.\\n\\nIn a memorandum to PDVSA’s finance chief, Simon Zerpa, the oil company’s trade and supply department warned further payment delay to NuStar could result in possible tanker embargoes, broken supply contracts with Caribbean customers and a shortage of fuels for Venezuela’s domestic market.\\n\\nIn the September meeting, PDVSA suggested it could terminate a related contract with NuStar for fuel oil tanks rental and sublease a portion of its Statia storage to an undisclosed firm as a way to reduce further debts.\\n\\nNuStar countered that PDVSA could pay off the debt with oil, or by allowing it to become a partner in the state-run company’s terminal on the island of Bonaire along with a partial payment to show good faith.\\n\\nIt is unclear if any agreement on topics different than the payment schedule was reached.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nWells Fargo scrutinized by regulator for auto insurance program: NYT\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'insurance\\', \\'reported\\', \\'occ\\', \\'program\\', \\'scrutinized\\', \\'york\\', \\'wells\\', \\'nyt\\', \\'report\\', \\'practices\\', \\'regulator\\', \\'auto\\', \\'times\\', \\'fargo\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) engaged in deceptive auto insurance practices, failed to properly manage risks and hasn’t set aside enough funds to pay back affected customers, the New York Times reported, citing a confidential report by federal regulators.\\nFILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo branch is seen in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, U.S. February 10, 2015.\\n(nyti.ms/2yBV90D)The preliminary regulators’ report stated that Wells Fargo may have underestimated costs related to reimbursing harmed customers and that the bank’s practices could be curbed or be kept under close watch, according to the New York Times report.\\nWells Fargo was slapped with costly lawsuits involving auto insurance and mortgage loans in July, even as the bank tries to put the year-old phony accounts scandal behind it where employees were found having created over 2 million accounts without customer authorization.\\nWells Fargo and the OCC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) engaged in deceptive auto insurance practices, failed to properly manage risks and hasn’t set aside enough funds to pay back affected customers, the New York Times reported, citing a confidential report by federal regulators.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo branch is seen in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, U.S. February 10, 2015.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\\n\\nTop independent installer Sunrun Inc (RUN.O) and smaller rivals, many of which are part of an aggressive industry lobbying effort opposed to new tariffs on panels, are warning homeowners considering going solar to sign up before tariffs cause prices to rise.\\n\\nOn its web site, Sunrun warns visitors that panel prices could double in 2018, raising the cost of an average installation by $3,000.\\n\\n“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.\\n\\nSmaller, local installers and solar advocates from California to Massachusetts are also raising the prospect of higher prices at sales consultations, in blog posts and at community events like farmer’s markets.\\n\\n“We are really urging people not to wait until 2018,” said Craig Forman, who leads a pro-solar community group in Newton, Massachusetts, that refers interested residents to two local solar contractors.\\n\\nThe marketing strategy comes at a time when the U.S. residential solar industry is in a slump. The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.\\n\\nThere are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term. In the third quarter, the number of new U.S. solar permits issued fell 11 percent from the previous year, though that was an improvement from the 24 percent and 16 percent drops in the first and second quarters, according to OhmHome, an online resource for consumers interested in going solar.\\n\\nIn California, the No. 1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.\\n\\nIn April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.\\n\\nSolar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.\\n\\nThe residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.\\n\\nNevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually. For sales processes that can take up to a year from when a homeowner first inquires about going solar, the trade case is giving potential customers a palpable reason to act now.\\n\\n“Installers are looking for any reason to get back in touch with the customer and a sense of urgency that will make their sales process be shorter,” Aggarwal said.\\n\\nNot all installers are talking about the trade case. Tesla, for instance, said it is awaiting the final outcome of the case before alerting potential customers.\\n\\nGigawatt Inc, a Placentia, California-based company that installs systems under the name GoGreenSolar.com, has seen a “spike” in sales since it began talking to customers about the trade case, according to CEO Deep Patel.\\n\\n“In the consumers’ mind prices are going to go down. Cell phones got cheaper, TVs got cheaper,” said Patel. “The last thing you want to do is tell them ‘Hey, Mr Smith, the project costs went up a couple of grand.\\'”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nAmazon offered billions for HQ2\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'offered\\', \\'second\\', \\'york\\', \\'city\\', \\'economic\\', \\'jersey\\', \\'market\\', \\'state\\', \\'amazon\\', \\'billions\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'hq2\\', \\'benefit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nSome, like Newark, are offering billions of dollars: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\\nAcross the Hudson River, New York City made a proposal without any incentives.\\nBut New York state is expected to offer some, according to a spokesman for the city\\'s economic development corporation.\\nIt\\'s also the headquarters of the retailer Amazon bought recently, Whole Foods Market.\\nAmazon will announce its decision for its second campus next year.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nDozens of U.S. cities have submitted bids to house Amazon\\'s second North American headquarters ahead of Thursday\\'s deadline to submit offers.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.\\n\\nNo. 1: Stanford University\\'s campus is seen from atop Hoover Tower in Stanford, California, U.S. on May 9, 2014. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo\\n\\nREUTERS TOP 100\\n\\nThe most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California\\'s Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology\\n\\nOverall, the top ranks of The World\\'s Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.\\n\\nIn contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.\\n\\nOverall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.\\n\\nAccording to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.\\n\\nNo. 2: A woman walks across the campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts May 16, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi\\n\\nOf course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.\\n\\nTo compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.\\n\\nSlideshow (8 Images)\\n\\nCareful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.\\n\\nDue to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.\\n\\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\\n\\nClick here for the full methodology.\\n\\n(Editing by Arlyn Tobias Gajilan and Alessandra Rafferty)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nコラム：ドル120円へ、衆院選後に再始動か＝鈴木健吾氏\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'コラムドル120円へ衆院選後に再始動か鈴木健吾氏\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n30 years on: Could there be another Black Monday?\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'dow\\', \\'english\\', \\'analyst\\', \\'far\\', \\'market\\', \\'saying\\', \\'red\\', \\'crash\\', \\'markets\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'30\\', \\'black\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nAnd the skies over London Are tinged with a gloom Some say is reminiscent of 30 years ago.\\nWhen the world witnessed what\\'s now known as the most famous crash in history - Black Monday.\\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) DARREN SINDEN, MARKET ANALYST, PEPPERSTONE, SAYING: \"I was a 32 - sorry 22-year-old trader and I hadn\\'t seen anything like that before.\\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) DARREN SINDEN, MARKET ANALYST, PEPPERSTONE, SAYING: \"It was just a sea of red really, red created further red.\\nBasically if you could get someone to pick up a phone and make you a price you sold whatever you wanted. \"\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nOctober, 2017.

The latest casualty figures, revised upward by six fatalities on Thursday, marked the greatest loss life from a single California wildfire event in 84 years. With 3,500 homes and businesses incinerated, the so-called North Bay fires also rank among the most destructive in state history. The fires have scorched more than 190,000 acres (77,000 hectares), an area nearly the size of New York City, reducing whole neighbourhoods in the city of Santa Rosa to grey ash and smouldering ruins dotted with charred trees and burned-out cars. The official cause of the disaster was under investigation, but officials said power lines toppled by gale-force winds on Sunday night may have sparked the conflagration. A resurgence of extreme wind conditions that had been forecast for Wednesday night and early Thursday failed to materialise, giving fire crews a chance to start carving containment lines around the perimeter of some of the blazes. But fierce winds were expected to return across much of the state as early as Friday night, and a force of 8,000 firefighters in Northern California were racing to reinforce and extend buffer lines before then, officials said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n分析：大量欧元区外债头寸要补汇率对冲 欧元涨势或将快马加鞭\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'分析大量欧元区外债头寸要补汇率对冲\\', \\'欧元涨势或将快马加鞭\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nSearching for Trump card, Democrats watch Virginia governor\\'s race\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'race\\', \\'recent\\', \\'voters\\', \\'northam\\', \\'president\\', \\'candidates\\', \\'governors\\', \\'card\\', \\'republican\\', \\'governor\\', \\'watch\\', \\'democrats\\', \\'searching\\', \\'virginia\\', \\'campaign\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nREUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoBut Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.\\nAfter denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol.\\nThe Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.\\n“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.\\n“Lieutenant Governor Northam has done a wonderful job of talking about Trump without mentioning Trump,” she said.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nRICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Speaking as a folksy physician running for Virginia governor, Democrat Ralph Northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight Donald Trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Virginia Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam, Democratic candidate for governor, delivers remarks before introducing former U.S. President Barack Obama to speak at a rally with supporters in Richmond, Virginia, U.S. on October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\\n\\nBut Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.\\n\\nThe balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.\\n\\nHe is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.\\n\\nThe Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.\\n\\nAfter denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.\\n\\n“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.\\n\\nMost polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.\\n\\nFormer Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.\\n\\nA recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.\\n\\nDistain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.\\n\\nYet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.\\n\\n“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.\\n\\nThe Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.\\n\\nNortham starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.\\n\\n“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.\\n\\nThe strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.\\n\\nShe said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.\\n\\n“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.\\n\\nGillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.\\n\\nDemocratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.\\n\\nShe admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.\\n\\n“Lieutenant Governor Northam has done a wonderful job of talking about Trump without mentioning Trump,” she said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nمصادر: مقتل ضابط شرطة وإصابة ضابطين ومجندين في اشتباك مع متشددين بمصر\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'مصادر\\', \\'وإصابة\\', \\'مع\\', \\'مقتل\\', \\'app\\', \\'ومجندين\\', \\'ضابط\\', \\'في\\', \\'متشددين\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'شرطة\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'ضابطين\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLyon s\\'impose contre un Everton à bout de nerfs\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'bout\\', \\'à\\', \\'le\\', \\'contre\\', \\'se\\', \\'et\\', \\'lyon\\', \\'simpose\\', \\'les\\', \\'everton\\', \\'la\\', \\'nerfs\\', \\'sur\\', \\'en\\', \\'williams\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLes Gones l‘emportent à Goodison Park contre Everton (2-1).\\nFekir ouvre le score à la 6e minute sur penalty mais les Rhodaniens tardent à enfoncer le clou.\\nEn grande difficulté en championnat et coaché par un Ronald Koeman sur la sellette, les Toffees se montrent peu sereins en deuxième période.\\nLe capitaine Ashley Williams bouscule Anthony Lopes et provoque une bagarre générale (66e) et échappe miraculeusement au carton rouge.\\nLyon prend la deuxième place du groupe E, à deux points de l‘Atalanta Bergame, vainqueur contre Limassol (3-1).\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMalgré des faits de jeu défavorables, l‘Olympique Lyonnais a obtenu sa première victoire en Ligue Europa ce jeudi lors de la 3e journée.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\\n\\nTop independent installer Sunrun Inc (RUN.O) and smaller rivals, many of which are part of an aggressive industry lobbying effort opposed to new tariffs on panels, are warning homeowners considering going solar to sign up before tariffs cause prices to rise.\\n\\nOn its web site, Sunrun warns visitors that panel prices could double in 2018, raising the cost of an average installation by $3,000.\\n\\n“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.\\n\\nSmaller, local installers and solar advocates from California to Massachusetts are also raising the prospect of higher prices at sales consultations, in blog posts and at community events like farmer’s markets.\\n\\n“We are really urging people not to wait until 2018,” said Craig Forman, who leads a pro-solar community group in Newton, Massachusetts, that refers interested residents to two local solar contractors.\\n\\nThe marketing strategy comes at a time when the U.S. residential solar industry is in a slump. The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.\\n\\nThere are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term. In the third quarter, the number of new U.S. solar permits issued fell 11 percent from the previous year, though that was an improvement from the 24 percent and 16 percent drops in the first and second quarters, according to OhmHome, an online resource for consumers interested in going solar.\\n\\nIn California, the No. 1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.\\n\\nIn April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.\\n\\nSolar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.\\n\\nThe residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.\\n\\nNevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually. For sales processes that can take up to a year from when a homeowner first inquires about going solar, the trade case is giving potential customers a palpable reason to act now.\\n\\n“Installers are looking for any reason to get back in touch with the customer and a sense of urgency that will make their sales process be shorter,” Aggarwal said.\\n\\nNot all installers are talking about the trade case. Tesla, for instance, said it is awaiting the final outcome of the case before alerting potential customers.\\n\\nGigawatt Inc, a Placentia, California-based company that installs systems under the name GoGreenSolar.com, has seen a “spike” in sales since it began talking to customers about the trade case, according to CEO Deep Patel.\\n\\n“In the consumers’ mind prices are going to go down. Cell phones got cheaper, TVs got cheaper,” said Patel. “The last thing you want to do is tell them ‘Hey, Mr Smith, the project costs went up a couple of grand.\\'”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nDutch engineers unveil 3D printed concrete bridge\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'team\\', \\'unveil\\', \\'concrete\\', \\'technology\\', \\'bridge\\', \\'university\\', \\'engineers\\', \\'dutch\\', \\'theo\\', \\'steel\\', \\'structural\\', \\'design\\', \\'printed\\', \\'3d\\', \\'eindhoven\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBut its designers say it\\'s the world\\'s first 3D printed concrete bridge.\\nAnd the team behind it says it\\'s just as strong as a conventional concrete bridge.\\nThe Eindhoven University of Technology team printed 800 layers of concrete for the design and spooled steel wire through the 3D printer on top of each layer to reinforce it.\\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) EINDHOVEN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY PROFESSOR OF STRUCTURAL DESIGN, THEO SALET, SAYING: \"Concrete worldwide is responsible for a lot of carbon dioxide exhaust.\\nAnd by printing concrete we can just place concrete at those spots where we need it and leave the concrete out where we don\\'t need it, so we use less concrete.\"\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nCyclists crossing this bridge in the Dutch village of Gemert won\\'t notice anything unusual.

REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani/File Photo\\n\\nIn defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran’s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region.\\n\\nA senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was “acting crazy” and was following U.S. strategy of increasing “the shadow of war in the region”.\\n\\nIran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.\\n\\n“In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.\\n\\n“The IRGC can’t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don’t back down.”\\n\\nThe day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards’ al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq’s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum.\\n\\nThe niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month.\\n\\nOther Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.\\n\\n“I don’t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,” she said. “He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.”\\n\\nLIGHTNING ASSAULT\\n\\nWithin days, Iran’s mostly Shi‘ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran’s hand in Iraq.\\n\\nCommanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi‘ite-led Iraqi central government’s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied.\\n\\nA video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi‘ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office.\\n\\nIran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism.\\n\\nAfter the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran.\\n\\nFRONT-LINE PLAYER\\n\\nRegional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi‘ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.\\n\\n“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,” said Khamenei. “Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.”\\n\\nSpeaking after Trump’s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: ”From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...\\n\\n“Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.”\\n\\nThe ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months.\\n\\nSmall boats from the Revolutionary Guards’ navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares.\\n\\nIn August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official.\\n\\nSome recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually.\\n\\nDuring the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL FLASHPOINT\\n\\nThe Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi‘ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.\\n\\n“The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi‘ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards.\\n\\nIn early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.\\n\\n“This is the first time that we’ve seen it used in this area,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack.\\n\\nDozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military.\\n\\nAsked about the threat posed by Shi‘ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump’s speech, Dillon said: “We’re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.”\\n\\nTrump’s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards’ political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet.\\n\\nSince becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards’ economic influence and involvement in political matters.\\n\\nNow, Rouhani’s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump’s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. “What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,” said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nPakistani anti-corruption court indicts ousted PM Sharif\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'court\\', \\'pakistan\\', \\'nab\\', \\'supreme\\', \\'ordered\\', \\'ousted\\', \\'trial\\', \\'maryam\\', \\'nawaz\\', \\'sharif\\', \\'islamabad\\', \\'indicts\\', \\'pakistani\\', \\'anticorruption\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-corruption court on Thursday indicted ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter over allegations linked to ownership of London properties, opening a trial that could see the former leader jailed.\\nPakistan\\'s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif speaks during a news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan September 26, 2017.\\nMuhammad Safdar, husband of Maryam Nawaz, daughter of ousted Pakistani premier Nawaz Sharif, waves from a a vehicle as he arrives at an accountability court in Islamabad, Pakistan October 19, 2017.\\nA policeman looks through binoculars from the rooftop of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court in Islamabad, Pakistan October 19, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Faisal MahmoodThe Supreme Court initially declined to dismiss Sharif but ordered an investigation into his family’s wealth.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-corruption court on Thursday indicted ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter over allegations linked to ownership of London properties, opening a trial that could see the former leader jailed.\\n\\nPakistan\\'s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif speaks during a news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan September 26, 2017.

The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul.\\n\\nThe most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said..\\n\\nThe so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said.\\n\\nPruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas.\\n\\nPruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies.\\n\\nThose ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\\n\\nBut Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration’s promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers.\\n\\n“It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,” Grassley said in a statement.\\n\\nIn the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog.\\n\\nRenewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was “grateful for Administrator Pruitt’s epiphany on the road to the RFS.”\\n\\nThe program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a coalition of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program.\\n\\n“If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,” Blair said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n強姦事件の２４歳男性無罪\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'turn\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'強姦事件の２４歳男性無罪\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n2016 World Economic Forum\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'week\\', \\'forum\\', \\'took\\', \\'president\\', \\'economic\\', \\'oil\\', \\'streets\\', \\'opec\\', \\'soon\\', \\'sidelines\\', \\'2016\\', \\'world\\', \\'panel\\', \\'zhdannikov\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nDark humor has dominated oil panels at Davos this year, notes Reuters energy editor Dmitry Zhdannikov, as industry leaders come to grips with plummeting crude prices.\\nAt one panel, the president of major oil producer Azerbaijan — where protestors last week took to the streets over the collapse of the national currency — made a quip about OPEC meetings.\\n\"Every time OPEC meets, the price goes down,\" President Ilham Aliyev.\\nJust as the panel ended, another oil executive jokedon the sidelines: \"I\\'m optimistic.\\nOil will soon cost $50.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDark humor has dominated oil panels at Davos this year, notes Reuters energy editor Dmitry Zhdannikov, as industry leaders come to grips with plummeting crude prices.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt one panel, the president of major oil producer Azerbaijan — where protestors last week took to the streets over the collapse of the national currency — made a quip about OPEC meetings.\\n\\n\"Every time OPEC meets, the price goes down,\" President Ilham Aliyev.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Therefore, we are very concerned about a possible new meeting.

Der CSU-Chef wiederholte diese Geste als atmosphärischer “Eisbrecher” dann noch mit einem Besuch bei der FDP.\\n\\nUnd am Mittwoch wurden gezielt Bilder lächelnder Politiker auf dem Balkon der Parlamentarischen Gesellschaft für die wartenden Fotografen und Kameraleute produziert. Mal winkte CDU-Chefin und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel im Kreis von Grünen-Politikern vom Balkon, mal FDP-Chef Christian Lindner zusammen mit CSU-Vertretern und der Kanzlerin. “Je harmonischer man sich aber nach außen zeigt, desto schwerer ist später zu vermitteln, warum keine Einigung möglich war”, heißt es in Jamaika-Kreisen. Ohnehin passt das Lächeln der Akteure genau zur Erwartung der Wähler. Laut ZDF-Politbarometer erwarten 80 Prozent der Grünen-, 75 Prozent der FDP- und 68 Prozent der Unions-Anhänger die Bildung einer Jamaika-Koalition. Denen müsste man das Scheitern der Gespräche erklären.\\n\\nEin wenig ähnelte die Stimmung dem ersten Besuch des französischen Präsident Emmanuel Macron in Berlin Mitte Mai, als Merkel ein Hermann-Hesse-Zitat nutzte, um das zukünftige Verhältnis zu beschreiben: “Allem Anfang wohnt ein Zauber inne.”\\n\\nDER WUNSCH ZU REGIEREN\\n\\nIn den vergangenen Tagen wurde zudem deutlich, wie sehr alle vier Parteien bereits in Kategorien des Regierens denken. Zwar betonte FDP-Chef Lindner am Donnerstag erneut, die Chancen auf eine Jamaika-Koalition stünden “Fifty-Fifty”. Aber gleichzeitig lässt sich Lindner in Interviews ständig über Ministeriumszuschnitte oder die Besetzung des Finanzministeriums aus. In der Union wird dazu vermerkt, dass so nur jemand argumentiere, der bereits an eine eigene Regierungsbeteiligung denke. FDP-Vize Wolfgang Kubicki betont jedenfalls, dass er sich für ministrabel hält und durchaus fähig, das Bundesfinanzministerium zu übernehmen.\\n\\nDen Grünen-Realos wird ohnehin unterstellt, unbedingt regieren zu wollen - dementsprechend optimistisch äußerte sich etwa Geschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Mittwoch, der nach dem Treffen mit der Union ein “gutes Gespräch” erlebt haben wollte. Und Partei-Chef Cem Özdemir wird nachgesagt, er sei am Amt des Außenministers interessiert, was dieser bislang nicht dementiert hat.\\n\\nCSU-Chef Seehofer lässt sich - trotz aller noch bestehenden inhaltlichen Differenzen - die Bereitschaft der CSU zu Regierungsbildung ablesen. “Es gab keine Verspannungen”, sagte er. Und Kanzleramtschef Peter Altmaier (CDU) folgerte nach den ersten Sondierungsrunden, er sehe bei allen Beteiligten den Willen, dass “dieses Experiment” ein Erfolg werde.\\n\\nGEMEINSAME ANGST VOR DER AFD\\n\\nDazu kommt eine gemeinsame Angst, die allen vier Parteien letztlich den Ausstieg aus den Jamaika-Gesprächen versperrt. Denn auch wenn die FDP anfangs alles andere als glücklich wirkte, dass der sofortige Rückzug der SPD in die Opposition nur eine Jamaika-Lösung möglich macht: Die Hoffnung, dass die Sozialdemokraten bei einem Scheitern der Gespräche als zweite Option zur Verfügung stünden, sind auch in der CSU gen Null gesunken. Scheitern die Sondierungen, dann wären wohl nur noch Neuwahlen möglich.\\n\\nAber die wollten eigentlich alle vier Parteien verhindern, heißt es in Unionskreisen. Denn wie ein Elefant stand am Mittwoch die AfD im Raum in der Parlamentarischen Gesellschaft. Über die Rechtspopulisten wurde zwar kaum geredet. Aber Seehofer betonte am Abend, dass man umso mehr über den gemeinsamen Wunsch aller Anwesenden gesprochen habe, einen Beitrag gegen Polarisierung, Radikalisierung und Spaltung zu leisten. Und bei einer Neuwahl, so die gemeinsame Überzeugung, würde wohl nur eine Partei sicher profitieren - die AfD, meint auch Forsa-Chef Manfred Güllner.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nRoads in India littered with firecracker waste after Diwali...\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'court\\', \\'20\\', \\'firecrackers\\', \\'hindu\\', \\'firecracker\\', \\'children\\', \\'bursting\\', \\'delhi\\', \\'worst\\', \\'littered\\', \\'waste\\', \\'india\\', \\'diwali\\', \\'roads\\', \\'pollution\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nIndia woke up to roads littered with layers of firecracker waste on Friday (October 20), a day after celebration of Diwali- Hindu festival of lights.\\nDiwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India\\'s majority Hindu community.\\nHowever, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers.\\nA local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions.\\nVehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nIndia woke up to roads littered with layers of firecracker waste on Friday (October 20), a day after celebration of Diwali- Hindu festival of lights. Diwali is traditionally ushered in with setting off of firecrackers by India\\'s majority Hindu community. The scene in New Delhi looked no different from the previous years despite the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers early this month to prevent a repeat of severe pollution levels that left the capital choking. However, the court order did not ban people from bursting firecrackers. A local resident of northern Lucknow city, Ramesh Chourasia, said bursting crackers was important for children to learn about Hindu traditions. Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years. Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCelebrating Diwali\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'strikes\\', \\'proislamic\\', \\'rebels\\', \\'city\\', \\'killed\\', \\'leveled\\', \\'air\\', \\'battle\\', \\'state\\', \\'heart\\', \\'celebrating\\', \\'diwali\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nMore than 1,000 people, mostly pro-Islamic State rebels, have been killed in the battle and the heart of the city of 200,000 has been leveled by air strikes.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMore than 1,000 people, mostly pro-Islamic State rebels, have been killed in the battle and the heart of the city of 200,000 has been leveled by air strikes.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nAirbus expects to sell \\'thousands\\' of CSeries jets - CEO\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'airbus\\', \\'jets\\', \\'thousands\\', \\'ceo\\', \\'aircraft\\', \\'aerospace\\', \\'expects\\', \\'cseries\\', \\'trade\\', \\'sell\\', \\'market\\', \\'bombardier\\', \\'venture\\', \\'programme\\', \\'boeing\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nMONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Friday he believed Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) CSeries planes would capture half the market for smaller single-aisle aircraft with the sale of “thousands” of the 110-to-130 seat jets.\\nA Bombardier CSeries aircraft is pictured during a news conference to announce a partnership between Airbus and Bombardier on the C Series aircraft programme, in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, October 17, 2017.\\nOn Thursday, the head of a major U.S. airplane leasing company said the deal boosts confidence in the CSeries programme, but is unlikely to drive a flurry of immediate sales.\\nCustomers will likely remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.\\nCommercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Friday he believed Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) CSeries planes would capture half the market for smaller single-aisle aircraft with the sale of “thousands” of the 110-to-130 seat jets.\\n\\nA Bombardier CSeries aircraft is pictured during a news conference to announce a partnership between Airbus and Bombardier on the C Series aircraft programme, in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, October 17, 2017.

Picture taken October 14, 2017. REUTERS/Feisal Omar/File Photo\\n\\nMore than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on Saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. The Islamist insurgency al Shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely.\\n\\nSomali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said Hussein Moalim Mohamud Sheikh Ali, a former national security adviser to the president.\\n\\n“The national security architecture is in tatters,” he told Reuters. “The Shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state.”\\n\\nThe increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in Somalia ahead of the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers at the end of the year. They also are a concern for other countries in the region where al Shabaab is active, such as Kenya and Uganda.\\n\\nIn 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in Somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by Nairobi-based thinktank Sahan Research.\\n\\nInitial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al Shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say.\\n\\nCompeting programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), four Western and one Somali security source told Reuters.\\n\\nA letter from Somalia’s minister of internal security addressed to the United States, Britain and the United Nations in May complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence.\\n\\n“Multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counter-terrorism efforts,” said the letter, seen by Reuters.\\n\\nThe pressure is building on President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who must ensure Somalia’s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000-strong AU force leaves.\\n\\nHis government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint U.S.-Somali raid on Bariire in August that residents say killed 10 civilians. Political disagreements threaten co-operation between Somalia’s federal and regional forces.\\n\\nLast week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. The interior ministry spokesman resigned this week.\\n\\nSomali police did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nHIGH-GRADE EXPLOSIVES\\n\\nObtaining high-grade military explosives - the material that makes a bomb explode - involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else.\\n\\nMaking their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the Sahan report and an upcoming report from a U.N. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on Somalia.\\n\\nAccording to the U.N. report which is due to be published next month, the U.S. Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, which is funded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicle-borne bomb incidents since 2016.\\n\\n“The potential use of HME (home-made explosive) by al Shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious … allow(ing) the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its IEDs,” said the report.\\n\\nAl Shabaab, which wants to overthrow Somalia’s U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed.\\n\\nMass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said.\\n\\nA former top al Shabaab commander, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. Robow defected to the government in August after the U.S. government removed a $5 million bounty for his capture.\\n\\nTwo Mogadishu-based security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to Reuters.\\n\\nThey said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit Mogadishu International Airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a European Union military training mission.\\n\\n“One bomb would have breached a checkpoint, opening the way for a larger bomb,” one of the Western security contractors told Reuters. “They also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base.”\\n\\nThe driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack, paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence, he said.\\n\\nA larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint, but was stopped at one known as Kilometer Five. Panicking, he tried to force his way through, but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck.\\n\\n“I could see the truck speeding. I also heard few gunshots behind it. Police must have been chasing it,” said Mohamed Ali, 21, who was injured in the blast.\\n\\n“As it advanced it came to many cars in the street, then the truck driver swerved abruptly to the left lane, but its tyres got stuck in the highway divider. What followed was the blast and smoke.”\\n\\nThe fireball tore through the intersection, incinerating hundreds of civilians. Many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves.\\n\\nThe driver of the car bomb was detained at another checkpoint by soldiers who had taken him out for questioning before its bomb also detonated.\\n\\nThree security sources told Reuters he identified himself as al Shabaab.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n焦点：中国钢厂更改合同安排 意在冬季需求下降期间保持丰厚利润\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'意在冬季需求下降期间保持丰厚利润\\', \\'焦点中国钢厂更改合同安排\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nProcter & Gamble, utili netti trim1 in crescita, conferma guidance intero anno\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'crescita\\', \\'anno\\', \\'guidance\\', \\'procter\\', \\'conferma\\', \\'utili\\', \\'trim1\\', \\'app\\', \\'netti\\', \\'massive\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'intero\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'gamble\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nVentas de casas usadas en EEUU se recuperan sorpresivamente en septiembre\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'se\\', \\'app\\', \\'ventas\\', \\'recuperan\\', \\'casas\\', \\'usadas\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'sorpresivamente\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'eeuu\\', \\'millions\\', \\'septiembre\\', \\'turn\\', \\'en\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nChina’s Xi to cement his power at Party Congress\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'week\\', \\'sign\\', \\'starting\\', \\'zedong\\', \\'president\\', \\'party\\', \\'congress\\', \\'tightening\\', \\'title\\', \\'xi\\', \\'power\\', \\'chinas\\', \\'cement\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nChinese President Xi Jinping may get a new title at the Communist Party Congress starting this week, a sign of his tightening grip on power.\\nReuters’ Ben Blanchard says the new title of party chairman would put him on par with the country’s founder Mao Zedong.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nChinese President Xi Jinping may get a new title at the Communist Party Congress starting this week, a sign of his tightening grip on power.

Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.\\n\\nVW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nEl Ibex mantiene la cautela ante la crisis catalana\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'mantiene\\', \\'crisis\\', \\'el\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'cautela\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'ibex\\', \\'catalana\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'la\\', \\'women\\', \\'ante\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nFed-Direktor Powell kann auf Chefposten in US-Notenbank hoffen\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'kann\\', \\'feddirektor\\', \\'hoffen\\', \\'der\\', \\'chefposten\\', \\'yellen\\', \\'den\\', \\'kandidaten\\', \\'hatte\\', \\'usnotenbank\\', \\'als\\', \\'powell\\', \\'sich\\', \\'er\\', \\'auf\\', \\'die\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nWashington (Reuters) - Im Rennen um den künftigen Chefposten bei der US-Notenbank Fed kristallisieren sich mit Jerome Powell und Kevin Warsh zwei heiße Kandidaten heraus: Fed-Direktor Powell hat der Zeitung “Politico” zufolge dabei die Nase vorn.\\nDer Präsident hatte sich zuletzt nicht in die Karten blicken lassen und gesagt, er möge alle fünf Kandidaten für den Chefposten.\\nDennoch gilt eine zweite vierjährige Amtszeit für Yellen als eher unwahrscheinlich.\\nEs gilt als wahrscheinlich, dass er sich äußert, bevor er am 3.\\nExperten hatten bereits in den vergangenen Tagen Powell als wahrscheinlichsten Kandidaten bezeichnet.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nWashington (Reuters) - Im Rennen um den künftigen Chefposten bei der US-Notenbank Fed kristallisieren sich mit Jerome Powell und Kevin Warsh zwei heiße Kandidaten heraus: Fed-Direktor Powell hat der Zeitung “Politico” zufolge dabei die Nase vorn.\\n\\nFederal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell discusses financial regulation in Washington, U.S., October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts - RC1A3C9E5C10\\n\\nDoch auch das ehemalige Notenbank-Führungsmitglied Warsh gilt weiter als aussichtsreicher Bewerber. US-Präsident Donald Trump will bald entscheiden, auf wen seine Wahl für das wichtige Amt an den geldpolitischen Schalthebeln gefallen ist. Doch hat er sich offenbar noch nicht festgelegt, wie Reuters von einer mit dem Vorgang vertrauten Person erfuhr: “Ich denke, er neigt noch keinem Kandidaten zu.”\\n\\nMit dem 64-jährigen Powell würde ein Währungshüter an die Spitze der mächtigsten Notenbank der Welt rücken, der bereits seit Jahren in deren Führungsetage sitzt. “Als Chef dürfte er wohl die Politik der schrittweisen Normalisierung der Geldpolitik fortsetzen, die Amtsinhaberin Janet Yellen eingeleitet hat”, prognostizieren die Volkswirte der Großbank UniCredit. Yellen hat die Zügel nach einer jahrelange Nullzins-Phase angesichts des anhaltenden Aufschwungs in den USA stufenweise gestrafft - auf das aktuelle Leitzins-Niveau von 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent. Sie will es bis zum Jahresende weiter erhöhen, falls die Konjunkturlage es zulässt.\\n\\nDer frühere Fed-Direktor Warsh gilt als Anhänger eines strafferen geldpolitischen Kurses. Der heute 47-Jährige hatte sich wegen Differenzen über die von der Notenbank im Kampf gegen die Folgen der globalen Finanzkrise eingeführten Geldschwemme 2011 aus dem Führungsgremium zurückgezogen. Warshs Vorliebe für eine eher straffe Geldpolitik dürfte bei Trump jedoch nicht gut ankommen, da er ein erklärter Anhänger niedriger Zinsen ist.\\n\\nDer Präsident hatte sich zuletzt nicht in die Karten blicken lassen und gesagt, er möge alle fünf Kandidaten für den Chefposten. Darunter ist auch sein Wirtschaftsberater Gary Cohn sowie der Ökonomie-Professor John Taylor. Alle habe bereits im Weißen Haus vorgesprochen. Als letzte Kandidatin hatte er am Donnerstag Yellen empfangen, deren Amtszeit Anfang Februar 2018 abläuft. Das Treffen sei “gut gelaufen”, sagte ein Insider. Dennoch gilt eine zweite vierjährige Amtszeit für Yellen als eher unwahrscheinlich. Trump hatte sie im Wahlkampf hart attackiert, bevor er ihre Leistung später in milderem Licht darstellte.\\n\\nWÜRFEL SOLLEN BIS ANFANG NOVEMBER FALLEN\\n\\nTrump neige zur Ernennung Powells, berichtete die Zeitung “Politico” am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf drei Regierungsinsider, die namentlich nicht genannt wurden. Trump hatte am Dienstag erklärt, er werde seine Entscheidung bald bekanntgeben. Es gilt als wahrscheinlich, dass er sich äußert, bevor er am 3. November zu einer Asien-Reise aufbricht.\\n\\nAls Reaktion auf den “Politico”-Bericht bauten die US-Staatsanleihen ihre Gewinne aus, in den letzten Handelsminuten der Wall Street drehte der S&P-500-Index noch ins Plus. Experten hatten bereits in den vergangenen Tagen Powell als wahrscheinlichsten Kandidaten bezeichnet.[nL8N1MU0B7] Der Jurist und frühere Investmentbanker hat in dem Führungsgremium der Fed als einziger Vertreter ein republikanisches Parteibuch - ebenso wie Trump.[nL8N1MU1R2] Da der Präsdient seinen Kandidaten auch vom Senat absegnen lassen muss. Da Powell wohl eher eine Linie wie Yellen fahren würde - die von den Demokraten mitgetragen wurde - gilt er als idealer Kompromisskandidat, der bei in beiden politischen Lagern Anklang finden könnte.\\n\\n<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n\"Politico\"-Bericht (Englisch) here\\n\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLifestyle News\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'entertainment\\', \\'saunders\\', \\'romans\\', \\'prize\\', \\'returns\\', \\'potter\\', \\'lifestyle\\', \\'romes\\', \\'lincoln\\', \\'london\\', \\'man\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nRecent Lifestyle NewsWith the crazy \\'Italics\\', Asterix returns for 37th adventure PARIS Asterix, the indomitable pint-sized Gaul forever outfoxing the Romans, returns for his 37th comic adventure on Thursday, this time battling his way across Italy in a chariot race.\\n| Entertainment, ItalyGeorge Saunders\\' \\'Lincoln in the Bardo\\' wins 2017 Man Booker prize LONDON American author George Saunders has won the 2017 Man Booker Prize, a high-profile literary award, for his first novel, \"Lincoln in the Bardo,\" - a fictional account of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln burying his young son.\\nEntertainment, ArtsHarry Potter exhibition blends wizardry with history LONDON A new exhibition celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book\\'s publication is offering \\'muggles\\' with an interest in magic the chance to view rare memorabilia, combined with historic artifacts referenced in the popular series.\\n| Entertainment, ArtsNo gladiators vs lions, but cheap seats now open in Rome\\'s Colosseum ROME Visitors to Rome\\'s Colosseum can now see the structure as poor Romans once did - minus the wild animals, gladiators and Christian martyrs.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nRecent Lifestyle News\\n\\nWith the crazy \\'Italics\\', Asterix returns for 37th adventure PARIS Asterix, the indomitable pint-sized Gaul forever outfoxing the Romans, returns for his 37th comic adventure on Thursday, this time battling his way across Italy in a chariot race. | Entertainment, Italy\\n\\nGeorge Saunders\\' \\'Lincoln in the Bardo\\' wins 2017 Man Booker prize LONDON American author George Saunders has won the 2017 Man Booker Prize, a high-profile literary award, for his first novel, \"Lincoln in the Bardo,\" - a fictional account of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln burying his young son.

About 7,500 people have been rescued in the waters off the coast of Libya since Thursday (May 4), according to the Italian and Libyan Coast Guards. Two groups of survivors said hundreds drowned when their rubber boats began to deflate. Some 540 migrants were brought to shore in Catania, Sicily on Monday (May 8) in shuttle runs by smaller vessels from an Italian naval ship that remained outside of the port. A UNHCR spokesperson said the number of people who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean so far this year now totalled over 1,150.

Bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on Thursday in a New York speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of President Donald Trump.\\n\\nBush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow Republican’s nine-month White House tenure. He did not mention Trump by name.\\n\\n“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” Bush said at the Bush Institute’s National Forum on Freedom, Free Markets and Security.\\n\\nTrump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “Crooked Hillary” for Democrat Hillary Clinton and, more recently, “Liddle” Bob Corker for a Republican senator who dared to challenge him.\\n\\nBush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that Trump has cracked down on while in office.\\n\\n“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said.\\n\\n“We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.”\\n\\nAsked whether the speech was aimed at Trump, a spokesman for Bush said the long-planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years.\\n\\n“The themes President Bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said Bush spokesman Freddy Ford.\\n\\nBush touted U.S. alliances abroad, something Trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused Trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year.\\n\\nFormer U.S. President George W.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\\n\\nCRITICIZES RUSSIA\\n\\nIn the speech, Bush described a decline in public confidence in U.S. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs.\\n\\n“Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said. “We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”\\n\\nTrump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that Democratic former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Obama, Trump’s predecessor, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii.\\n\\nSlideshow (2 Images)\\n\\nBush said Americans were the heirs of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.\\n\\n“This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American,” he said. “It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”\\n\\nTrump has had a rocky relationship with the Bush family. He belittled former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was an early opponent of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, and has criticized George W.

Libya\\'s coastguard intercepted a boat carrying 128 migrants on Monday (August 28) which according to one of those onboard was headed for Italy. Coastguard official Ashraf al-Badry said the migrants were found onboard a dinghy, were moved onto a coastguard ship before being taken to a Tripoli naval base. They were later taken to a detention centre in the capital. One Tunisian migrant, Basheer Ben Ali, said he paid a smuggler 2000 Libyan dinars (1,503 USD) to board the boat but the engine was too weak to make enough progress across the Mediterranean Sea. It comes as the leaders of Germany, Italy, Spain, Chad, Niger and Libya meet in Paris for a migration summit on Monday. An Elysee official said the agenda would include ideas on fighting people traffickers, asylum rights and stabilising chaotic Libya, where thousands of migrants end up before embarking on a perilous Mediterranean sea journey to Europe. Nearly 120,000 migrants, including refugees, have entered Europe by sea so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. More than 2,400 have drowned while making the dangerous odyssey, often in overcrowded dinghies run by people smugglers without enough food or water.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nObama blasts \\'politics of division\\' on return to campaign trail\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'division\\', \\'trail\\', \\'obama\\', \\'politics\\', \\'president\\', \\'white\\', \\'blasts\\', \\'return\\', \\'elections\\', \\'republican\\', \\'house\\', \\'jersey\\', \\'virginia\\', \\'campaign\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing “politics of division” that he said was corroding American democracy.\\n“It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century.”At a later stop in Richmond, Virginia, Obama said modern politics increasingly did not reflect basic American values of inclusiveness and were driving people away from the process.\\nDemocrats hope Obama can bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.\\nFormer president Barack Obama speaks during a rally for New Jersey Democratic Gubernatorial candidate Jim Murphy in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. October 19, 2017.\\nObama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing “politics of division” that he said was corroding American democracy.\\n\\nWithout mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama told campaign rallies in New Jersey and Virginia that voters could send a powerful message about the type of politics they want by backing Democrats in Nov. 7 elections in the two states.\\n\\n“What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before, that dates back centuries,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark, New Jersey, that chanted: “Four more years.”\\n\\n“Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay\\n\\nBritons have not seen their debt costs rise since July 2007, shortly before the financial crisis which pushed the world’s fifth-biggest economy into its deepest recession in decades.\\n\\nNow, eight years into the recovery, the BoE is saying it is likely to raise rates “in the coming months”. Investors mostly say that means as soon as Nov. 2, after its next policy meeting.\\n\\nAt one level, increasing Bank Rate to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent would represent only a reversal of last year’s emergency rate cut after the shock Brexit vote.\\n\\nBut many British businesses are worried it might have an outsized impact on the mindset of consumers.\\n\\n“When I have been around the country, businesses have been asking a lot about the Bank of England,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry.\\n\\n“There is nervousness about the psychological impact of the first increase.”\\n\\nThe messaging challenge could be all the harder after several failed attempts in recent years by Governor Mark Carney and the BoE to signal when rates were likely to rise.\\n\\nThe guidance was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call Carney an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014, an epithet that has stuck.\\n\\nIn June, sterling fell and then rose as Carney made two speeches in eight days in which he seemed to change the emphasis of his message away from being in no hurry to consider a rate hike to saying one might become necessary.\\n\\nIt remains unclear if the BoE will pull the trigger in November. Most economists polled by Reuters last month said the time was not right for a hike, yet they still expected the BoE to press on.\\n\\nBritish inflation is at a five-year high of 3 percent, above the BoE’s 2 percent target. But the economy is facing deep uncertainty about Britain’s departure from the European Union and is growing at half the pace of the euro zone.\\n\\nNOT THAT BIG A DEAL?\\n\\nPaul Fisher, a BoE rate-setter until 2014, said raising rates once by 25 basis points was “not that big a deal”.\\n\\n“The key thing is what they say alongside it,” he said. “The Bank has been out of the game ... in terms of affecting ordinary people’s lives. It might suddenly become part of their consciousness again, especially the people who pay a mortgage.”\\n\\nThe BoE has said repeatedly that it expects to raise rates in a “limited and gradual” way, echoing the caution among many other central banks about the fragility of their economies.\\n\\nEconomists say it will probably continue to send that cautious message after its first move.\\n\\nFinancial markets expect the BoE to make only one 25-basis point rate hike in 2018 after a first increase next month.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether British consumers, the main drivers of the economy, see it that way too.\\n\\n“On the occasions when the Bank has tried to signal quite clearly that they’re making just a one-off hike, households haven’t listened to the nuanced guidance,” Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.\\n\\n“They see their mortgage rates going up and they prepare for more increases in that direction.”\\n\\nWhen the BoE last raised rates in 2007, it said it had made no judgment on its next move. But the balance of households expecting a hike over the next 12 months stood at double the historical average a month later and consumer confidence fell, Tombs said.\\n\\nBoE officials, like their peers around the world, have tried increasingly to find the best way to speak to borrowers.\\n\\nIn contrast to the days when central banks operated in near-secrecy and did not even publicly announce rate changes, Carney gives regular media interviews to speak directly to consumers and companies whose spending drives the economy.\\n\\nBut things do not always go to plan.\\n\\nCarney has often had to challenge the idea that the BoE’s guidance on rates represents a rock-solid promise. That nuance is often lost in media reporting, BoE officials complain.\\n\\n“It’s not always fully understood,” the central bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane told reporters after speaking at an event in London earlier this month. “When the data changes and the facts change, our view needs to evolve. That doesn’t mean the view was wrong before. The facts sometimes change.”\\n\\nThis time, however, even economists who think the BoE would be making a mistake by raising rates in November say it looks likely to happen, even if only to avoid another communications misfire that could further complicate its messaging task.\\n\\nJean Michel Six, chief economist in Europe for ratings agency Standard & Poor‘s, said the BoE ran the risk of losing credibility if it continued to hold off.\\n\\n“It’s a bit of a vicious circle. Once you go too far in the direction of saying you may very well increase rates, you have to do it. Otherwise you lose your credibility,” Six said.\\n\\n“It’s a game you can only play for some time.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nOld \\'Bedlam\\' asylum inspires modern artists\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'worlds\\', \\'hospital\\', \\'psychiatric\\', \\'royal\\', \\'bedlam\\', \\'modern\\', \\'origin\\', \\'inspires\\', \\'word\\', \\'artists\\', \\'reports\\', \\'old\\', \\'oldest\\', \\'produced\\', \\'patients\\', \\'asylum\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBethlem Royal Hospital is the world\\'s oldest psychiatric hospital - the origin of the word \\'Bedlam\\'.\\nBut these days, it\\'s known for the modern art produced by its current and former patients.\\nLucy Fielder reports.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nBethlem Royal Hospital is the world\\'s oldest psychiatric hospital - the origin of the word \\'Bedlam\\'.

The Mercedes-Benz parent has problems aplenty, which bumper third-quarter sales do little to change. A plan to carve out its car and truck units might help lift its valuation if that eventually led to a separate listing. But at the current pace of progress, investors have no reason to give the company much credit.\\n\\nA man sits in an electric automobile by carmaker Daimler before a annual shareholder meeting in Berlin, April 13, 2011. REUTERS/Thomas Peter (GERMANY - Tags: BUSINESS SPORT MOTOR RACING) - BM2E74D0Y1701\\n\\nFriday’s third-quarter results were a reminder of the rocky ride that Daimler faces in the short term. One-off costs such as diesel-emissions fixes meant third-quarter operating profit fell by 14 percent from a year earlier to 3.5 billion euros. That was despite record sales of almost 600,000 Mercedes-Benz and smart automobiles. But the real challenges for auto groups like the Mercedes maker are far bigger and include a margin-sapping shift to electric vehicles and potentially declining car ownership from the growth of ride-hailing apps.\\n\\nThere’s no fighting these trends, but Daimler could do shareholders a favour by spinning off its trucks and buses arms, which merit a higher valuation than the conglomerate’s lowly multiple of 7.7 times forward earnings. First, the division faces less fierce competition than the cars business. Second, online shopping has created a boom in logistics and delivery vehicles. Daimler trucks and buses together brought in more than 37 billion euros of revenue last year, but barely show up in the German group’s share price because of a huge conglomerate discount. Spinning them off could boost the group’s value by more than 30 billion euros, Evercore ISI analysts estimate.\\n\\nDaimler’s management is alert to the threats facing the industry, and has proposed sensible restructuring ideas to adapt to a changing world. For example, the company on Monday announced its plan to split into three parts – trucks and buses, cars and vans, and financial services. But neither separate listings nor divestments are currently part of management’s public plans. Even the intermediate step of legally separating the three bits will be voted on in 2019 at the earliest. A more meaningful restructuring is too far away to make much difference to Daimler’s valuation right now.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nФУТБОЛ-Россия опустилась на рекордно низкое место в рейтинге ФИФА\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'низкое\\', \\'место\\', \\'на\\', \\'рейтинге\\', \\'футболроссия\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'рекордно\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'фифа\\', \\'children\\', \\'в\\', \\'опустилась\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCommentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'trumps\\', \\'constitution\\', \\'executive\\', \\'insurance\\', \\'care\\', \\'voters\\', \\'premiums\\', \\'congress\\', \\'act\\', \\'blame\\', \\'undemocratic\\', \\'power\\', \\'orders\\', \\'action\\', \\'commentary\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nThe president is required by Article Two of the Constitution to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So are his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional?\\nDonald Trump holds up his executive order to undo the Affordable Care Act after signing it at the White House on October 12, 2017.\\nPolicy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it.\\nBut in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions.\\nWhen Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nDonald Trump last week signed an executive order and took further administrative action that will weaken the healthcare coverage of millions of Americans. The president is required by Article Two of the Constitution to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So are his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional?\\n\\nDonald Trump holds up his executive order to undo the Affordable Care Act after signing it at the White House on October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\\n\\nParticularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.\\n\\nTrump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPaul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit\\n\\nPeter Apps: China\\'s \\'Big Brother\\' tech gives surveillance new reach\\n\\nWe know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.\\n\\nAlthough Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.\\n\\nTrump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)\\n\\nThe withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.\\n\\nWhile this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.\\n\\nThe problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.\\n\\nRepublican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.\\n\\nWhen considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBritain wants Brexit accord but prepared for a \\'no deal\\' - Davis\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'prepared\\', \\'union\\', \\'davis\\', \\'told\\', \\'unions\\', \\'accord\\', \\'european\\', \\'britain\\', \\'deal\\', \\'unseen\\', \\'wants\\', \\'david\\', \\'brexit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants to reach agreement over the terms of its departure from the European Union but is prepared for a “no deal” scenario, Brexit minister David Davis said on Friday.\\nBritain\\'s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis holds a joint news conference with European Union\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (unseen) after the latest round of talks in Brussels, Belgium October 12, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Francois Lenoir“We don’t want a ‘no deal,’ but if one comes, we’ll be ready for it,” Davis told broadcasters.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants to reach agreement over the terms of its departure from the European Union but is prepared for a “no deal” scenario, Brexit minister David Davis said on Friday.\\n\\nBritain\\'s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis holds a joint news conference with European Union\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (unseen) after the latest round of talks in Brussels, Belgium October 12, 2017.

Unilever’s struggle gives hope to predators. The consumer giant that fended off a bid from Kraft Heinz earlier this year reported weak third-quarter sales on Thursday. Chief Executive Paul Polman is sprucing up brands, but the more pedestrian Unilever’s performance, the more vulnerable it becomes.\\n\\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman speaks at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\\n\\nThe maker of pot-noodles blamed factors beyond its control for a weak third quarter, which saw sales excluding disposals and acquisitions rise by 2.6 percent, well short of analysts’ expectations of 3.9 percent. The hot summer meant people ate less ice cream, while hurricanes disrupted spending and shipping.\\n\\nYet the figures also reflect longer-term challenges. Growth in developed economies is slow, and health-conscious customers are changing their habits, meaning consumer goods companies cannot rely on old brands. One example: Halo Top, a family-owned healthy ice cream brand, grabbed share in North America. Unilever reckons just half its products took a bigger slice of their respective markets, down from around 60 percent in previous years.\\n\\nPolman is making the right calls. He is selling dying brands, like margarine, buying new ones, and finding fresh ways of distributing products, like direct-to-consumer subscription services. And while the outlook in Europe and North America is dull, emerging economies are growing quickly. Unilever is also pushing up margins: analysts expect the company to convert 20 percent of sales into operating profit by 2020.\\n\\nStill, Polman can’t rest easy. Unilever will need a strong fourth quarter if it is to meet its target for sales growth of 3 to 5 percent this year. More disappointments could revive takeover interest. Investors might look more favourably on Kraft Heinz’s near-30 percent operating margin if Unilever’s growth remains little better than average. Activist investors who are taking on ever-bigger targets such as Procter & Gamble, might also see the company as a candidate for deeper cost cutting and more radical surgery.

Sparkles and glitter hail on pompous plumes of carnival dresses as dancers in wooden clogs tap the rhythm of a Belgian fiesta. \"Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules\" includes Belgian specialties like its beer, chocolate, bicycles and smoking pipes to grotesque masquerade, exposing all the vices of Belgian society and questioning its rules. \"My aim as an artist is to evoke the minds of spectators, to make spectators feel and think in a different way,\" Fabre said. \"But this is never in the working process - oh, we\\'re gonna shock or provoke people. Never.\" The performance is interlaced with elegant living pictures reminiscent of the works of the country\\'s famous painters. \"Don\\'t forget - we are a country that created oil painting,\" Fabre said proudly ahead of his show that pays homage to Hieronymus Bosch\\'s \"Ship of Fools\" painting, Pieter Bruegel\\'s snowy fields and the misty lands of Rene Magritte. \"Belgian Rules/Belgium Rules\" was brought to Russia by the Territory festival - a platform which has promoted modern theater in Russia since 2005.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nRajoy no despeja la incógnita sobre las medidas asociadas al artículo 155\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'al\\', \\'rajoy\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'las\\', \\'incógnita\\', \\'medidas\\', \\'app\\', \\'artículo\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'sobre\\', \\'despeja\\', \\'asociadas\\', \\'millions\\', \\'la\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nWall Street ends flat\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'street\\', \\'wall\\', \\'signs\\', \\'phone\\', \\'jobless\\', \\'ends\\', \\'michael\\', \\'stocks\\', \\'shares\\', \\'bapis\\', \\'markets\\', \\'flat\\', \\'lowest\\', \\'hightower\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nApple took the shine off Wall Street Thursday on the 30th anniversary of the Black Monday market crash.\\nBut a rally in utilties and healthcare stocks helped the Dow and S&P 500 come back to close flat from an earlier deficit.\\nMichael Bapis of Bapis Group at HighTower: SOUNDBITE: MICHAEL BAPIS, PARTNER, BAPIS GROUP AT HIGHTOWER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"People are getting nervous.\\nTwo bright signs on the labor front: The number of Americans filing jobless claims fell to its lowest level in nearly 45 years.\\nIn Europe, political upheaval in Spain and disappointing earnings from Unilever and Publicis pulled the markets lower.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nApple took the shine off Wall Street Thursday on the 30th anniversary of the Black Monday market crash.

Photo taken October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tim Reid\\n\\n“It really upset me,” said Westerman, 63, a self-described “middle-class guy” with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.\\n\\nWesterman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.\\n\\nTrump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.\\n\\nSome insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama’s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.\\n\\n“It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,” said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.\\n\\nWesterman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter’s college tuition. “He says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?”\\n\\nA White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nTrump has called subsidy payments a “gift” for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.\\n\\nSome people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.\\n\\n“I support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,” said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.\\n\\n“Forget the president – it’s the Congress’s responsibility. They’re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,” Heuring said.\\n\\nIn addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump’s cutoff is settled in court.\\n\\nThe moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2kL2RAq\\'\\n\\nMIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE\\n\\nIf the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\\n\\nThese include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.\\n\\nKaryn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.\\n\\nFeit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America’s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.\\n\\nHer current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump’s decision.\\n\\n“The first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,” said Feit, a Democrat.\\n\\nTrump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.\\n\\n“It is a concern obviously,” Lewis said.\\n\\nGRAPHIC-The Trump Effect: Repeal and Replace\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nMessi marca de tiro libre en victoria de Barcelona por Liga Campeones; PSG sigue arrasando\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'psg\\', \\'marca\\', \\'women\\', \\'liga\\', \\'sigue\\', \\'por\\', \\'tiro\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'victoria\\', \\'messi\\', \\'children\\', \\'libre\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'en\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTop News & Business Videos\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'videos\\', \\'stark\\', \\'work\\', \\'predominantly\\', \\'president\\', \\'white\\', \\'business\\', \\'taking\\', \\'political\\', \\'shows\\', \\'whites\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nAn analysis of federal hiring data under President Donald Trump shows his administration has handed political appointments mainly to whites and predominantly to white men since taking office, a stark contrast to the work force under former President Barack Obama.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nAn analysis of federal hiring data under President Donald Trump shows his administration has handed political appointments mainly to whites and predominantly to white men since taking office, a stark contrast to the work force under former President Barack Obama.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nNo trade talks but UK\\'s May wins gesture at summit\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'right\\', \\'press\\', \\'second\\', \\'talks\\', \\'mean\\', \\'wins\\', \\'trade\\', \\'saying\\', \\'uks\\', \\'things\\', \\'uk\\', \\'leaders\\', \\'gesture\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'london\\', \\'summit\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nEU leaders agree to make internal preparations for the second phase of Brexit talks with London.\\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk confirming the news on the second day of a summit in Brussels But leaders still want a clearer commitment that Britain will settle its financial obligations.\\nLeaders are now expected to target December for London to improve its settlement offer.\\nWith many in the UK keen for things to progress.\\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, CEBR, VICKY PRYCE, SAYING: \"Businesses are screaming now.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nA tentative green light.

Macy’s said holiday hiring was “off to a great start”.\\n\\nBut staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand.\\n\\nThe staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers’ annual profits.\\n\\n“Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,” said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions.\\n\\nHer clients include Lowe’s Cos Inc, Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs.\\n\\nU.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the “gig economy” and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool.\\n\\nThe hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nIn comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month.\\n\\nThe job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago.\\n\\n“There just aren’t enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,” the site’s chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.\\n\\nNO BONUS\\n\\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics’ JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs.\\n\\nRecruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more.\\n\\n“The jobs have become bigger,” Manpower Group’s Hassett said. “A manager will do more at the stores, they’ll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to.”\\n\\nWal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.\\n\\n“We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,” said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart’s senior manager of corporate communications.\\n\\nJ.C. Penney said it was introducing paid time off for part-time hourly associates, starting from early 2018, to entice seasonal hires to stay beyond the holiday season.\\n\\nHigher up the food chain, recruiters also point to bonuses that have lagged other industries as harming efforts to draw in and keep talented regional managers or heads of business lines.\\n\\n“They (retailers) are paying lower bonuses and some companies have paid lower bonuses for a couple of years,” talent acquisition firm Korn Ferry’s retail expert Craig Rowley said.\\n\\nAn analysis by Korn Ferry of 40 big North American retailers showed that 73 percent paid little to no bonuses to senior executives for their performance in 2016.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo\\n\\nTrump said last week his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\\n\\nSince then, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated.\\n\\n”We are worried that consumers on (Obamacare) plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes and that this will cause them to not seek out assistance,” said Bryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, which helps consumers choose and sign up for individual health plans offered under Obamacare.\\n\\nTrump, who promised during his election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he has called a “disaster,” has said the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies.\\n\\nBy law, health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies.\\n\\nAnticipating Trump’s move, insurers proposed higher prices on monthly premiums in 2018 to recoup the money. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates – a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.\\n\\nLAST WORD ON SUBSIDIES?\\n\\nThe fate of the subsidies remained in limbo on Thursday. A senior White House aide said that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The SoCal Health Care Coalition protests U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s executive order on healthcare at UC San Diego in La Jolla, California, U.S., October 12, 2017.

The CBO still expects 11 million people to sign up for next year - an increase from this year’s enrollment of 10 million.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump smiles after signing an Executive Order to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bone health insurance plans and circumvent Obamacare rules at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 12, 2017.

But leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word.\\n\\nAnthem Inc Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish told Reuters he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restating them through “potential congressional action” would affect pricing next year. Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.\\n\\nShould the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates, or provide rebates for consumers.\\n\\n“A midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,” said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. “Intermountain Healthcare would pursue this.”\\n\\nWashington state’s insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical - even the next month - if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. But that could run up against federal government objections.\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized, an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. At the same time, the administration is working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account Trump’s cut in subsidies for 2018.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n特朗普首次亮相联合国 批评该机构官僚主义\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'united\\', \\'特朗普首次亮相联合国\\', \\'批评该机构官僚主义\\', \\'signing\\', \\'usdrafted\\', \\'rough\\', \\'secretarygeneral\\', \\'stronger\\', \\'urged\\', \\'effective\\', \\'world\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the United Nations on Monday as being overburdened with bureaucracy and mismanagement and urged reforms so that the world body emerges stronger and a more effective force for peace.\\nMore than 120 countries were invited to attend the meeting after signing on to a U.S.-drafted 10-point political declaration backing efforts by U.N.

speech about Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military and economic force in the Islamic Republic has shown it has no intention of curbing its activities in the Middle East.\\n\\nFILE

REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani/File Photo\\n\\nIn defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran’s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region.\\n\\nA senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was “acting crazy” and was following U.S. strategy of increasing “the shadow of war in the region”.\\n\\nIran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.\\n\\n“In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.\\n\\n“The IRGC can’t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don’t back down.”\\n\\nThe day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards’ al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq’s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum.\\n\\nThe niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month.\\n\\nOther Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.\\n\\n“I don’t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,” she said. “He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.”\\n\\nLIGHTNING ASSAULT\\n\\nWithin days, Iran’s mostly Shi‘ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran’s hand in Iraq.\\n\\nCommanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi‘ite-led Iraqi central government’s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied.\\n\\nA video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi‘ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office.\\n\\nIran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism.\\n\\nAfter the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran.\\n\\nFRONT-LINE PLAYER\\n\\nRegional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi‘ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.\\n\\n“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,” said Khamenei. “Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.”\\n\\nSpeaking after Trump’s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: ”From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...\\n\\n“Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.”\\n\\nThe ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months.\\n\\nSmall boats from the Revolutionary Guards’ navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares.\\n\\nIn August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official.\\n\\nSome recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually.\\n\\nDuring the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL FLASHPOINT\\n\\nThe Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi‘ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.\\n\\n“The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi‘ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards.\\n\\nIn early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran’s Shi‘ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.\\n\\n“This is the first time that we’ve seen it used in this area,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack.\\n\\nDozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military.\\n\\nAsked about the threat posed by Shi‘ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump’s speech, Dillon said: “We’re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.”\\n\\nTrump’s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards’ political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet.\\n\\nSince becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards’ economic influence and involvement in political matters.\\n\\nNow, Rouhani’s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump’s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. “What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,” said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nVenezuela\\'s state of misery\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'ongoing\\', \\'shortages\\', \\'recession\\', \\'rampant\\', \\'misery\\', \\'transcript\\', \\'sacrifices\\', \\'venezuelas\\', \\'produced\\', \\'state\\', \\'venezuelans\\', \\'uncertainty\\', \\'view\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nDaily life for Venezuelans is marked by hunger, sacrifices and uncertainty after years of ongoing shortages, rampant inflation and economic recession.\\nProduced by Canice Leung.\\n▲ Hide Transcript▶ View Transcript\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nDaily life for Venezuelans is marked by hunger, sacrifices and uncertainty after years of ongoing shortages, rampant inflation and economic recession.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo\\n\\nTrump said last week his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\\n\\nSince then, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated.\\n\\n”We are worried that consumers on (Obamacare) plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes and that this will cause them to not seek out assistance,” said Bryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, which helps consumers choose and sign up for individual health plans offered under Obamacare.\\n\\nTrump, who promised during his election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he has called a “disaster,” has said the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies.\\n\\nBy law, health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies.\\n\\nAnticipating Trump’s move, insurers proposed higher prices on monthly premiums in 2018 to recoup the money. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates – a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.\\n\\nLAST WORD ON SUBSIDIES?\\n\\nThe fate of the subsidies remained in limbo on Thursday. A senior White House aide said that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The SoCal Health Care Coalition protests U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s executive order on healthcare at UC San Diego in La Jolla, California, U.S., October 12, 2017.

The CBO still expects 11 million people to sign up for next year - an increase from this year’s enrollment of 10 million.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump smiles after signing an Executive Order to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bone health insurance plans and circumvent Obamacare rules at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 12, 2017.

But leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word.\\n\\nAnthem Inc Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish told Reuters he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restating them through “potential congressional action” would affect pricing next year. Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.\\n\\nShould the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates, or provide rebates for consumers.\\n\\n“A midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,” said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. “Intermountain Healthcare would pursue this.”\\n\\nWashington state’s insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical - even the next month - if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. But that could run up against federal government objections.\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized, an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. At the same time, the administration is working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account Trump’s cut in subsidies for 2018.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTrump on the defensive, denies \"insensitive\" claim\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'defensive\\', \\'frederica\\', \\'obama\\', \\'wilson\\', \\'fallen\\', \\'denies\\', \\'president\\', \\'claim\\', \\'congresswoman\\', \\'widow\\', \\'insensitive\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'saying\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPresident Trump denied claims by Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson who said that the president told the widow of fallen soldier Sgt.\\nTrump denies \\'insensitive\\' call to fallen soldier widow (SOUNDBITE) PRESIDENT TRUMP DENYING ACCUSATIONS \"Didn\\'t say what that Congresswoman said, didn\\'t say it at all.\"\\n(SOUNDBITE) PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES TO DENY ACCUSATIONS \"Did not say what the Congresswoman said and most people aren\\'t too surprised to hear that.\"\\n(SOUNDBITE) REP.

He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.\\n\\nWith the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.\\n\\nThe more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

He’s made so many “Golmaal” films that it is impossible to tell them apart. So you stop bothering with numbers, because you know it is going to run with the same formula all over again and engineered towards making that elusive thing Bollywood likes to call a “commercial blockbuster”.\\n\\nHandout photo\\n\\nAjay Devgn, Arshad Warsi, Kunal Khemu, Shreyas Talpade and Tusshar Kapoor reprise their roles from the earlier films. The women, of course, are dispensable and easily replaced. This time, the setting is an orphanage in the hill town of Ooty. Gopal (Devgn), an orphan with anger issues and an irrational fear of ghosts, decides to leave town with friend Laxman (Talpade) after an altercation with three other orphans. Many years later, all of them meet at the last rites of the founder of the orphanage, and discover that all is not well.\\n\\nAn evil builder is out to destroy the orphanage, a spirit seems to haunt the house where the men are staying, and the mysterious Damini (Parineeti Chopra) seems to have a secret that only puzzles people in the film. Audiences can see it coming a mile away.\\n\\nBut for all its predictability, “Golmaal Again” is funny. The first half of the film is full of good slapstick comedy, combined with an inspired running joke on Nana Patekar. Warsi and Kemmu display excellent comic timing, while Johnny Lever brings his dependable comedic genius to the screen to deliver some truly rollicking moments. Tabu as the benevolent librarian who guides the men on their mission is understated and efficient.\\n\\nBut it is too good to last. As the second half rolls in, things get sluggish, the jokes get rarer and the mission to save the orphanage seems to be taking a tad too long. Shetty’s story doesn’t have the emotional heft or enough jokes to entertain us for 151 minutes – the film’s runtime.\\n\\nBut for what it is worth, this film stays clear of sexist jokes, toilet humour and making fun of the disabled. For that alone, “Golmaal Again” is one up on its earlier iterations.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nArts - Entertainment\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'entertainment\\', \\'expected\\', \\'million\\', \\'artist\\', \\'exhibition\\', \\'paris\\', \\'auction\\', \\'fetch\\', \\'arts\\', \\'pink\\', \\'london\\', \\'works\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nHarry Potter exhibition blends wizardry with history LONDON A new exhibition celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book\\'s publication is offering \\'muggles\\' with an interest in magic the chance to view rare memorabilia, combined with historic artifacts referenced in the popular series.\\n|Too racy for Louvre, sex sculpture finds home at Pompidou Centre PARIS In the end it was just too kinky for the Louvre.\\nCopyright restored to poor family of Australian Aboriginal artist SYDNEY The impoverished family of Australia\\'s most famous Aboriginal artist, Albert Namatjira, has been given copyright to his works after years of fruitless campaigning triggered the intervention of a philanthropist.\\nWorld\\'s largest pink diamond expected to fetch up to $30 million at auction LONDON \"The Pink Raj\", an intense pink diamond described by experts as the world\\'s largest, is expected to fetch up to $30 million when it is auctioned in Geneva next month.\\n|Paris exhibition charts Picasso\\'s \\'year of wonders\\' PARIS Some of Pablo Picasso\\'s greatest works go on display in Paris this week, in an exhibition that charts a pivotal year in which he cemented his status as a titan of 20th-century art.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nHarry Potter exhibition blends wizardry with history LONDON A new exhibition celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book\\'s publication is offering \\'muggles\\' with an interest in magic the chance to view rare memorabilia, combined with historic artifacts referenced in the popular series. |\\n\\nToo racy for Louvre, sex sculpture finds home at Pompidou Centre PARIS In the end it was just too kinky for the Louvre.\\n\\nWe are closer than ever to 1930s-style totalitarianism: Atwood FRANKFURT The world is closer to the dark days of the 1930s than at any time since, Canadian author Margaret Atwood said on Saturday in Frankfurt, where she was due to receive a prestigious German literary award.\\n\\nCopyright restored to poor family of Australian Aboriginal artist SYDNEY The impoverished family of Australia\\'s most famous Aboriginal artist, Albert Namatjira, has been given copyright to his works after years of fruitless campaigning triggered the intervention of a philanthropist.\\n\\nStars of British art world donate works for Grenfell fire survivors LONDON A group of Britain\\'s most successful contemporary artists has donated valuable works to sell at a charity auction for the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed about 80 people at a London social housing block in June.\\n\\nWorld\\'s largest pink diamond expected to fetch up to $30 million at auction LONDON \"The Pink Raj\", an intense pink diamond described by experts as the world\\'s largest, is expected to fetch up to $30 million when it is auctioned in Geneva next month.\\n\\nDa Vinci portrait of Christ expected to fetch $100 million at auction NEW YORK The last privately owned Leonardo da Vinci painting and one of fewer than 20 by the Renaissance artist known to still exist is hitting the auction block, Christie\\'s announced on Tuesday. |\\n\\nParis exhibition charts Picasso\\'s \\'year of wonders\\' PARIS Some of Pablo Picasso\\'s greatest works go on display in Paris this week, in an exhibition that charts a pivotal year in which he cemented his status as a titan of 20th-century art. |\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nRajoy kündigt Maßnahmen zur Regierungsübernahme in Katalonien an\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'die\\', \\'zur\\', \\'dem\\', \\'rajoy\\', \\'kündigt\\', \\'nach\\', \\'regierungsübernahme\\', \\'der\\', \\'katalonien\\', \\'samstag\\', \\'und\\', \\'region\\', \\'mariano\\', \\'maßnahmen\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBrüssel (Reuters) -

Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance.\\n\\nAltun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.\\n\\nIraq’s top Shi‘ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority.\\n\\nSistani’s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi‘ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin.\\n\\nVehicles of Kurdish Peshmarga Forces are seen near Altun Kupri between Kirkuk and Erbil, Iraq October 20, 2017.

Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves.\\n\\nKurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants.\\n\\nIraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.\\n\\n“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.\\n\\n“Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. what is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians,” said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kopri. “The Americans sold us to Iran,” he added, echoing widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades.\\n\\nAn Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany.\\n\\nGermany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen.

EU leaders have said discussions on the future EU-UK trading relationship will not take place until they have had more details on how Britain will settle the bill. They are expected on Friday (October 20) to set a target of December for London to improve its divorce settlement offer. But in a conciliatory gesture they are also likely to call on their staff to prepare for the next stage of talks.

A estatal deverá obter o dinheiro para o pagamento com uma oferta de ações que reduzirá a União a uma fatia minoritária na companhia.\\n\\nOs recursos de privatizações devem ajudar o governo federal a tentar cumprir suas metas orçamentárias.\\n\\nPedrosa disse ainda que os planos para a privatização preveem também limites à participação de investidores na Eletrobras.\\n\\n“Estamos investindo (na ideia de privatização) para trazer resultado e criar uma corporação... com uma limitação, em que nenhum acionista tenha mais de 10 por cento do bloco de controle, uma empresa com lógica privada”, disse Pedrosa.\\n\\nO diretor-geral da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), Romeu Rufino, também presente no debate, disse que para o órgão regulador é indiferente se uma empresa como a Eletrobras tem controle estatal ou privado, mas ressaltou que ineficiências da companhia nos últimos anos têm punido os consumidores com custos mais elevados.\\n\\nEle deu como exemplos o atraso na entrega de obras devido à crise financeira enfrentada pela empresa.\\n\\n“O grupo Eletrobras assumiu compromissos que não conseguiu entregar, por várias dificuldades. Tanto no segmento de transmissão quanto no de geração, convivemos com atrasos que não foram indiferentes para o setor como um todo, principalmente para o consumidor. Afetou o consumidor de forma significativa... isso não pode continuar”, disse.\\n\\nEle também defendeu a venda das distribuidoras de eletricidade da Eletrobras como uma questão essencial para a própria sobrevivência dessas empresas, que são responsáveis pelo atendimento a Estados do Norte e Nordeste e enfrentam pesados e recorrentes prejuízos.\\n\\nMas o diretor ressaltou que o modelo previsto pelo governo para viabilizar a desestatização da Eletrobras, que prevê uma mudança nos contratos de hidrelétricas antigas da companhia, poderá impactar o consumidor, uma vez que as usinas poderão vender sua produção a preços maiores.\\n\\nEssas hidrelétricas hoje entregam a energia às distribuidoras por preços muito baixos, em um chamado “regime de cotas”. O processo de mudança nos contratos desses empreendimentos tem sido chamado de “descotização”.\\n\\nRufino defendeu que o governo precisa ter cuidado nesse processo para evitar uma forte elevação das tarifas.\\n\\n“A descotização, isoladamente, não vai na direção da modicidade tarifária. A privatização da Eletrobras, se tem um ganho de eficiência, então ela vai nesse sentido, sim. Uma coisa compensa a outra? Não sei.”\\n\\nPara o ex-diretor da Aneel Edvaldo Santana, agora presidente da Abrace, associação que representa grandes indústrias, a Eletrobras nos últimos anos passou a assumir diversos custos que depois acabaram sendo repassado aos consumidores.\\n\\n“Independentemente do problema ideológico, a privatização da Eletrobras é um problema de custo. Ela se tornou uma agregadora de custos... a privatização, com a descotização, aumenta a tarifa... mas os ganhos compensam tudo isso, não precisa fazer nenhuma conta, só de acabar com esse ciclo vicioso de aumento de custos”, afirmou ele, também presente na Fiesp.\\n\\nO governo tem falado em concluir todo o processo de privatização da elétrica federal até o final do primeiro semestre de 2018.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n分析：英国央行玩坏“狼来了” 利率信号混乱市场难懂\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'分析英国央行玩坏狼来了\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'warning\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'利率信号混乱市场难懂\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nTech, bank stocks lift Wall Street; tax-cut plan back in focus\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'street\\', \\'wall\\', \\'lift\\', \\'focus\\', \\'week\\', \\'sp\\', \\'tech\\', \\'points\\', \\'nasdaq\\', \\'500\\', \\'technology\\', \\'york\\', \\'stocks\\', \\'taxcut\\', \\'bank\\', \\'companies\\', \\'plan\\', \\'way\\', \\'earnings\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Technology and bank stocks lifted Wall Street on Friday and investor optimism received a fresh boost from Washington, where the Trump administration inched a step closer to implementing tax-cut plan.\\nFILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is pictured in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2017.\\nHopes of tax cuts have helped the market rally, as companies expect the move to lift economic growth and inflation.\\nSo far more than 70 percent of the 88 S&P 500 companies have beat profit expectations.\\nPayPal’s (PYPL.O) 4.8 percent rise after upbeat earnings also lifted the tech stocks .SPLRCT.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Technology and bank stocks lifted Wall Street on Friday and investor optimism received a fresh boost from Washington, where the Trump administration inched a step closer to implementing tax-cut plan.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is pictured in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2017.

REUTERS/Edgar Su\\n\\nThey say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.\\n\\n“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”\\n\\nBy the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).\\n\\nSteve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.\\n\\n\"People don\\'t realize what is about to happen, when you\\'re in the middle of exponential growth,\" said REC\\'s O\\'Neil. \"It\\'s transformational.\\n\\nSome European funds are among those looking at the region.\\n\\n“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.\\n\\n“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.\\n\\nSoutheast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.\\n\\nSolar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.\\n\\nThe region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.\\n\\nAt the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.\\n\\nThere are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.\\n\\nA signage at an REC solar panel manufacturing plant in Singapore May 5, 2017. Picture taken May 5, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su\\n\\nStoring solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.\\n\\nVENTURE CAPITAL\\n\\nBringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.\\n\\nGA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.\\n\\n“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.\\n\\nSlideshow (14 Images)\\n\\nHe said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.\\n\\nMid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.\\n\\nKPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.\\n\\n“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.\\n\\nKILLER ARGUMENT\\n\\nAt the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.\\n\\n“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.\\n\\nFounded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”\\n\\nIn 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.\\n\\nThe business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.\\n\\nTo survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.\\n\\n“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nUE quiere tener negociaciones de comercio con el Mercosur pese a nerviosismo de Francia\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'pese\\', \\'negociaciones\\', \\'francia\\', \\'mercosur\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'quiere\\', \\'nerviosismo\\', \\'tener\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'el\\', \\'ue\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'comercio\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nPeso mexicano gana tras reporte sobre relevo en Fed, América Móvil anima a bolsa\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'tras\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'relevo\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'peso\\', \\'massive\\', \\'mexicano\\', \\'gana\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'sobre\\', \\'móvil\\', \\'fed\\', \\'millions\\', \\'reporte\\', \\'turn\\', \\'en\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nSiderúrgica Kobe Steel dice que violó normas legales y reconoce pérdida de clientes por escándalo\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'que\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'app\\', \\'legales\\', \\'siderúrgica\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'y\\', \\'por\\', \\'massive\\', \\'normas\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'warning\\', \\'steel\\', \\'millions\\', \\'reconoce\\', \\'violó\\', \\'turn\\', \\'pérdida\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n神鋼に外部調査委設置指示、経産省「信頼性根本から損なう」\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'神鋼に外部調査委設置指示経産省信頼性根本から損なう\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLusso, cinese Hony acquisisce 30% Duemmei (Mr & Mrs Italy)\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'duemmei\\', \\'hony\\', \\'mrs\\', \\'women\\', \\'italy\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'mr\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'cinese\\', \\'children\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'lusso\\', \\'30\\', \\'acquisisce\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n欧洲汇市：英镑反弹，受脱欧磋商取得进展的希望提振\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'欧洲汇市英镑反弹受脱欧磋商取得进展的希望提振\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n２２～２４日、広範囲で大雨\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'２２２４日広範囲で大雨\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nSenate panel postpones hearing with Trump lawyer Cohen in Russia probe\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'committee\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'hearing\\', \\'lawyer\\', \\'russia\\', \\'cohen\\', \\'president\\', \\'attorney\\', \\'donald\\', \\'senate\\', \\'probe\\', \\'intelligence\\', \\'postpones\\', \\'washington\\', \\'panel\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo\\n\\nAs the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.\\n\\nOil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.\\n\\nAs a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.\\n\\nThe “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.\\n\\n“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”\\n\\nThe oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.\\n\\nPrince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.\\n\\nWAITING IT OUT\\n\\nFalih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.\\n\\nThey said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.\\n\\nOPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.\\n\\n“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.\\n\\nAn oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.\\n\\nOPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.\\n\\nTraders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.\\n\\nOpen interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.\\n\\nSHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE\\n\\n\"Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,\" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.\\n\\nThe United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.\\n\\nBerentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.\\n\\n“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\\n\\nOPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.\\n\\nMISTAKES OF THE PAST\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.\\n\\nJeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.\\n\\nThat may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.\\n\\n“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.\\n\\nBesides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.\\n\\nWhile major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nYellen\\'s quiet power meets Trump’s force as term-end looms\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'quiet\\', \\'meets\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'federal\\', \\'term\\', \\'janet\\', \\'president\\', \\'looms\\', \\'yellen\\', \\'yellens\\', \\'power\\', \\'interview\\', \\'finalists\\', \\'reserve\\', \\'termend\\', \\'force\\', \\'final\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nCurrent Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was the final of five finalists to interview with President Trump as her term as Fed chief ends early next year.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nCurrent Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was the final of five finalists to interview with President Trump as her term as Fed chief ends early next year.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nGE vows $20 billion asset sales, \\'sweeping change\\' as profit falls\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'ge\\', \\'forecast\\', \\'vows\\', \\'change\\', \\'20\\', \\'operations\\', \\'sweeping\\', \\'billion\\', \\'share\\', \\'sales\\', \\'power\\', \\'profit\\', \\'ges\\', \\'falls\\', \\'asset\\', \\'performance\\', \\'poor\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nREUTERS/Daniel BecerrilHis comments came as GE badly missed Wall Street expectations and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares down 2.9 percent to $22.90.\\nGE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.\\nGE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said.\\nCash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.\\nRevenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHGE.N).\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Calling its results “horrible” and “unacceptable,” General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new chief executive vowed on Friday to shed more than $20 billion worth of assets and hold executives accountable for failing to deliver profits.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of General Electric Co. is pictured at the Global Operations Center in San Pedro Garza Garcia, neighbouring Monterrey, Mexico, on May 12, 2017.

A $1,000 investment on the day former CEO Jeff Immelt started his tenure would be worth $1,006.38 today. Immelt stepped down Aug. 1.\\n\\nAs proof of GE’s new approach to performance, outgoing CFO Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.\\n\\n“That sense of accountability has to start with me,” he said. “We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me.”\\n\\nGE’s poor financial performance in the third quarter showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE’s highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark “robust dialog,” he said and shedding some of the 18 directors was “being examined.”\\n\\nGE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\\n\\nGE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.\\n\\nGE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.\\n\\nGE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said. Industrial cash flow from operations fell mainly ”because of lower power volume, resulting in lower earnings and higher inventory.”\\n\\nProfit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.\\n\\nCash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.\\n\\nRevenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHGE.N).\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nIraqi forces complete takeover of Kirkuk province after clashing with Kurds\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'clashing\\', \\'iraq\\', \\'peshmerga\\', \\'takeover\\', \\'iraqi\\', \\'kupri\\', \\'kurds\\', \\'kirkuk\\', \\'province\\', \\'northern\\', \\'complete\\', \\'region\\', \\'forces\\', \\'kurdish\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nA cyclist gestures at Iraqi security forces, on a street of Kirkuk, Iraq October 19, 2017.\\nKurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said.\\nThe Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.\\nIraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.\\n“Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,” tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani’s assistant.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nBAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces took control on Friday of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said.\\n\\nA cyclist gestures at Iraqi security forces, on a street of Kirkuk, Iraq October 19, 2017.

Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.\\n\\nFormer Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.\\n\\nA recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.\\n\\nDistain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.\\n\\nYet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.\\n\\n“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.\\n\\nThe Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.\\n\\nNortham starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.\\n\\n“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.\\n\\nThe strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.\\n\\nShe said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.\\n\\n“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.\\n\\nGillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.\\n\\nDemocratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.\\n\\nShe admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.\\n\\n“Lieutenant Governor Northam has done a wonderful job of talking about Trump without mentioning Trump,” she said.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nUK health experts warn of \\'post-antibiotic apocalypse\\'\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'prone\\', \\'infections\\', \\'need\\', \\'health\\', \\'postantibiotic\\', \\'antibiotics\\', \\'resistance\\', \\'treatments\\', \\'experts\\', \\'apocalypse\\', \\'uk\\', \\'warn\\', \\'scientists\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'say\\', \\'saying\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nThey say by 2050, 10 million people a year could die from previously treatable conditions.\\nThere are patients with diabetes who are more prone to infections.\\nOver-prescription of the drugs by doctors is blamed, as well as their use in the livestock industry.\\nAround 700,000 people die each year from drug-resistant infections such as tuberculosis and malaria.\\nWithout tough action, scientists say we\\'re heading for a post-antibiotic age that will spell the end of modern medicine.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nThe world faces an antibiotic apocalypse.

They do it by creating a plasma ball made of hydrogen inside a growth chamber. Methane, which is a carbon source, is added. The carbon mix rains down on the diamond seeds, layer by layer, creating a large, rough diamond that is cut and polished. The process takes about 10 to 12 weeks.

REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo\\n\\nMatt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.\\n\\nStreb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.\\n\\n“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”\\n\\nLayoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.\\n\\nThe U.S. auto industry\\'s boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump\\'s victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2smL7NQ\\'\\n\\n“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”\\n\\nLast week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.\\n\\nMark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.\\n\\nIn the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.\\n\\n“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”\\n\\nLong-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.\\n\\nIn Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.\\n\\nLordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.\\n\\nGM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.\\n\\n“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”\\n\\nLordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A general view of the outside of the General Motors Chevrolet Cruze car assembly complex in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo\\n\\nMatt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.\\n\\n\"The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,\" Streb said. \"This is just another Lordstown downturn.\"\\n\\nInfographic ID: \\'2siZUJk\\'\\n\\nSTALLING SEDAN SALES\\n\\nThe decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.\\n\\nHowever, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.\\n\\nFor much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.\\n\\nAfter peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.\\n\\nThrough the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.\\n\\nTo avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.\\n\\nGM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.\\n\\nMore GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.\\n\\nMany laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.\\n\\nRandy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”\\n\\nThe threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.\\n\\nAt GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.\\n\\nAt Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.\\n\\n“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”\\n\\nClick here for reading Reuters Investigates: Hard Labor\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nOperating factory robots with virtual reality\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'virtual\\', \\'researchers\\', \\'workers\\', \\'white\\', \\'robots\\', \\'factory\\', \\'robot\\', \\'system\\', \\'operating\\', \\'collar\\', \\'way\\', \\'space\\', \\'reality\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nSTORY: For white collar workers, the internet has transformed how people go about their business - participating in an office meeting \\'virtually\\' is commonplace.\\nBut for blue collar workers, the same can\\'t be said.\\nEven as robots continue to enter the factories, human workers are still critical to many production processes.\\nBut now researchers are developing a system which allows workers to remotely control robots using a virtual reality space.\\nWhen a user puts on a VR headset, they enter the robot\\'s head, seeing what the robot sees and controlling its arms and hands with controllers in a virtual space.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nSTORY: For white collar workers, the internet has transformed how people go about their business - participating in an office meeting \\'virtually\\' is commonplace. But for blue collar workers, the same can\\'t be said. Even as robots continue to enter the factories, human workers are still critical to many production processes. But now researchers are developing a system which allows workers to remotely control robots using a virtual reality space. When a user puts on a VR headset, they enter the robot\\'s head, seeing what the robot sees and controlling its arms and hands with controllers in a virtual space. That virtual space is key, according to the researchers, because it allows a robot and human to sync up in a common space, avoiding the headaches and nausea associated with remotely controlling a robot directly due to signal delays. The researchers still have a way to go to fine tune the system but are confident that in the future blue collar workers may be able to take advantage of telecommuting in much the same way as white collar workers do today.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n中国1-9月国企利润同比增长24.9% 钢铁等行业持续盈利--财政部\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'钢铁等行业持续盈利财政部\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'中国19月国企利润同比增长249\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nNew York police round up wandering cow in Brooklyn park\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'park\\', \\'brooklyn\\', \\'fence\\', \\'cow\\', \\'wandering\\', \\'york\\', \\'animal\\', \\'city\\', \\'used\\', \\'beast\\', \\'department\\', \\'round\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City police wrangled a cow on the loose in a Brooklyn park on Tuesday after the animal became a spectacle for tourists and New Yorkers alike when it was spotted roaming the streets and enjoying the park facilities.\\nAt other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.\\nOfficers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.\\nPolice said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.\\nThe New York City Parks Department also got in on the act, tweeting: “Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” When another user responded that the animal was, in fact, a bull, the department replied, “Excuse our calf...er, gaffe.”\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City police wrangled a cow on the loose in a Brooklyn park on Tuesday after the animal became a spectacle for tourists and New Yorkers alike when it was spotted roaming the streets and enjoying the park facilities.\\n\\nThe bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.\\n\\nAt other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.\\n\\nOfficers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.\\n\\nPolice eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.\\n\\nOfficers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.\\n\\nIt was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost.

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.\\n\\nIranian president Hassan Rouhani extends his hand to Iran\\'s Judiciary chief Sadegh Larijani during a Tehran swearing-in ceremony for Rouhani\\'s latest term, August 5, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS\\n\\nNot all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nTillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nJohn Lloyd: How hate speech can harm your brain\\n\\nBryce Covert: The tax reform that Republicans are missing\\n\\nRafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”\\n\\nIt’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.\\n\\nIf Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.\\n\\nShoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS\\n\\nFirst, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”\\n\\nSecond, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.\\n\\nIn stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.\\n\\nThird, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.\\n\\nFourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.\\n\\nFinally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.\\n\\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.\\n\\nThe lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n亚洲橡胶：10月20日TOCOM期胶1000GMT晚盘收市价\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'亚洲橡胶10月20日tocom期胶1000gmt晚盘收市价\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nVideo: CyberRisk\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'sophisticated\\', \\'topsecret\\', \\'highly\\', \\'microsofts\\', \\'internal\\', \\'told\\', \\'video\\', \\'cyberrisk\\', \\'hacking\\', \\'tracking\\', \\'software\\', \\'microsoft\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nMicrosoft’s top-secret internal database for tracking bugs in its own software was broken into by a highly sophisticated hacking group several years ago, five former Microsoft employees told Reuters.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMicrosoft’s top-secret internal database for tracking bugs in its own software was broken into by a highly sophisticated hacking group several years ago, five former Microsoft employees told Reuters.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nAppeals court refuses to reinstate Trump\\'s travel ban\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'rebuke\\', \\'court\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'travel\\', \\'reinstate\\', \\'supreme\\', \\'stinging\\', \\'white\\', \\'ban\\', \\'temporary\\', \\'appeals\\', \\'refuses\\', \\'refused\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nIn a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump, a U.S. Appeals Court refused on Thursday to reinstate his temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations, delivering another blow to the White House in a legal battle likely headed to the Supreme Court.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nIn a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump, a U.S. Appeals Court refused on Thursday to reinstate his temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations, delivering another blow to the White House in a legal battle likely headed to the Supreme Court.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCompetition bites at Unilever, Nestle under pressure\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'pressure\\', \\'nestle\\', \\'unilevers\\', \\'spread\\', \\'states\\', \\'business\\', \\'market\\', \\'unilever\\', \\'bites\\', \\'somewhat\\', \\'soundbite\\', \\'world\\', \\'competition\\', \\'think\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nThere\\'s hardly a household in the world that doesn\\'t have a product made by Unilever or Nestle.\\nBut the sheer size of the two food and consumer goods giants is often a challenge in a changing world.\\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: \"Had Unilever had sold its spread business two years ago it would have been selling at the top of the market.\\nIf it\\'s selling its spread business in 2017 I think it\\'s somewhat off the top of the market in terms of the demand for that type of asset.\"\\nBut Nestle\\'s also restructuring - something it says it will speed up as pressure from activist investor Third Point increases.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nThere\\'s hardly a household in the world that doesn\\'t have a product made by Unilever or Nestle. But the sheer size of the two food and consumer goods giants is often a challenge in a changing world. Unilever\\'s been losing market share to smaller competitors. Third quarter sales rose 2.6 percent - well below expectations of close to 4 per cent - the amount the company\\'s shares fell on the news. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: \"Unilever has been somewhat blown off course in the quarter by hurricanes in the United States and poor weather in Europe rather than the mechanical impact of the reduction of buying in the States. I think it\\'s more to do with the fact that their leeway and ability to be nimble, has been compromised by their size.\" Many had hoped an attempted $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz in February would have sparked a swift improvement. Instead Unilever\\'s only gaining market share in half of its business - that\\'s a 10 percent fall. Even an imminent sale could come a little late. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CITY INDEX MARKET ANALYST, KEN ODELUGA, SAYING: \"Had Unilever had sold its spread business two years ago it would have been selling at the top of the market. If it\\'s selling its spread business in 2017 I think it\\'s somewhat off the top of the market in terms of the demand for that type of asset.\" The trend for fresh, healthier products is also a challenge for the Swiss maker of packaged food. Organic sales growth for the year is expected to be 0.3 of a percent less than last year. Seasonal factors - like the timing of Chinese new Year - were blamed. But Nestle\\'s also restructuring - something it says it will speed up as pressure from activist investor Third Point increases.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nAsia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities - 2017\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'universities\\', \\'innovative\\', \\'south\\', \\'technology\\', \\'asia\\', \\'research\\', \\'university\\', \\'korea\\', \\'ranking\\', \\'science\\', \\'pacifics\\', \\'list\\', \\'2017\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nRanked #1: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea released on August 29, 2016.\\nThose are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\\nThe second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea.\\nFinally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.\\nThis is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - The news out of South Korea is dominated by political instability, but inside the country, strong and stable relationships between academia and industry continue to drive economic growth and technological innovation. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.\\n\\nRanked #1: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea released on August 29, 2016. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and technology (KAIST)/Handout via Reuters\\n\\nREUTERS TOP 75\\n\\nThe most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.\\n\\nKAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\\n\\nRecent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.\\n\\nThe second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.\\n\\nSouth Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.\\n\\nRanked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\\n\\nOverall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)\\n\\nSome nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it\\'s not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.\\n\\nAnd some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.\\n\\nSlideshow (3 Images)\\n\\nTo compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.\\n\\nThis is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).\\n\\nThe returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan\\'s Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.\\n\\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\\n\\nTo see the full methodology, visit here.

A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.\\n\\nNestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.\\n\\nEfficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.\\n\\n“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”\\n\\nRadar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.\\n\\nBeyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers.

That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.\\n\\nAmong the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.\\n\\nIridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.\\n\\nNokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.\\n\\n“HOPE AND PROMISE”\\n\\nThe strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.\\n\\nRadar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.\\n\\nThat’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.\\n\\n“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”\\n\\nTrailers sit in a lot equipped with \"BlackBerry Radar\" boxes, that perform a fleet-tracking service which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of truck trailers, at the Titanium Transportation trucking firm in Bolton, Ontario, Canada on June 7, 2017. Picture taken on June 7, 2017.

And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.\\n\\nWith Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.\\n\\nBlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.\\n\\nSlideshow (8 Images)\\n\\nSandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.\\n\\n“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”\\n\\nBlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.\\n\\nOn its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.\\n\\nAT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.\\n\\nThe company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.\\n\\nThe Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.\\n\\nRaymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.\\n\\nMacquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.\\n\\n“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.\\n\\n“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nIndia this week\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'week\\', \\'strikes\\', \\'proislamic\\', \\'rebels\\', \\'city\\', \\'killed\\', \\'leveled\\', \\'air\\', \\'battle\\', \\'state\\', \\'heart\\', \\'india\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nMore than 1,000 people, mostly pro-Islamic State rebels, have been killed in the battle and the heart of the city of 200,000 has been leveled by air strikes.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMore than 1,000 people, mostly pro-Islamic State rebels, have been killed in the battle and the heart of the city of 200,000 has been leveled by air strikes.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nRPT-ACTUALIZA 1-Argentinos deciden en elecciones legislativas profundidad de la apertura de su economía\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'su\\', \\'millions\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'elecciones\\', \\'economía\\', \\'deciden\\', \\'massive\\', \\'legislativas\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'warning\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'apertura\\', \\'la\\', \\'profundidad\\', \\'turn\\', \\'en\\', \\'rptactualiza\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nThis is a test stream\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'raqqa\\', \\'stream\\', \\'usbacked\\', \\'militias\\', \\'syria\\', \\'tying\\', \\'northern\\', \\'test\\', \\'state\\', \\'plans\\', \\'political\\', \\'kurdishled\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nBEIRUT Raqqa will be part of a decentralized federal Syria now the city has been freed from Islamic State, the U.S.-backed militias that captured it said on Friday, tying its political future to Kurdish-led autonomy plans for northern Syria.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nBEIRUT Raqqa will be part of a decentralized federal Syria now the city has been freed from Islamic State, the U.S.-backed militias that captured it said on Friday, tying its political future to Kurdish-led autonomy plans for northern Syria.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nViewsroom: U.S. election, European banks, Uber-Didi\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'opposition\\', \\'needs\\', \\'lenders\\', \\'infrastructure\\', \\'banks\\', \\'uberdidi\\', \\'uber\\', \\'european\\', \\'test\\', \\'election\\', \\'viewsroom\\', \\'stress\\', \\'ups\\', \\'ridesharing\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump battle over infrastructure needs, while Trump faces growing opposition from fellow billionaires.\\nAlso: the ups and downs of Europe’s lenders after a stress test with no fail grade, and why Uber is ceding to Didi the ride-sharing crown in China.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump battle over infrastructure needs, while Trump faces growing opposition from fellow billionaires.

Even after an initial alert, other cartel participants can reduce EU fines -- by up to 50 percent for the first to step forward with material evidence.\\n\\nVW offices have not been subject to EU raids in relation to the cartel investigation, a spokesman for the Wolfsburg-based car giant said on Friday, declining further comment.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nReuters.com\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'reuterscom\\', \\'beijing\\', \\'south\\', \\'hopes\\', \\'xi\\', \\'regulator\\', \\'transgender\\', \\'temperature\\', \\'way\\', \\'cultural\\', \\'women\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nColumn: With U.S. elder abuse in spotlight, a look at guardians CHICAGO Are unsuspecting seniors around the United States being scooped up without warning from their homes, placed in nursing homes and having their possessions taken away?\\n|New Zealand\\'s \\'first bloke\\' hooks into new role New Zealand not only has its youngest female prime minister with the rise to power of center-left Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, but a renegade new \"first bloke\" who is a national celebrity in his own right.\\nChina box office revenues to bounce back in 2017: regulator BEIJING China\\'s movie box office revenue is expected to grow in 2017 at more than three times the pace of last year thanks to the success of blockbusters like \"Wolf Warrior 2\", the media regulator said on Friday.\\nAmid South Korea freeze, China says cultural exchanges take the temperature BEIJING Cultural exchanges between countries need to consider the \"temperature\" of popular opinion and how people feel about each other, a senior Chinese official said on Friday, amid a freeze in cultural ties with South Korea over an anti-missile system.\\n|Playboy\\'s first transgender \\'playmate\\' hopes to \\'pave way for all women\\' LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Men\\'s magazine Playboy has featured its first ever transgender \\'playmate\\' centerfold in its November issue, a move which the model hopes will pave the way for \"all women - trans or otherwise - in fashion and other sectors\".\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nColumn: With U.S. elder abuse in spotlight, a look at guardians CHICAGO Are unsuspecting seniors around the United States being scooped up without warning from their homes, placed in nursing homes and having their possessions taken away?\\n\\nWith tears and song, China welcomes Xi as great, wise leader BEIJING Chinese officials on Thursday heaped praise on President Xi Jinping\\'s political ideology, unveiled a day earlier at a key Communist Party Congress, a sign that it could be enshrined in the party\\'s constitution and further cement his power. |\\n\\nNew Zealand\\'s \\'first bloke\\' hooks into new role New Zealand not only has its youngest female prime minister with the rise to power of center-left Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, but a renegade new \"first bloke\" who is a national celebrity in his own right.\\n\\nChina box office revenues to bounce back in 2017: regulator BEIJING China\\'s movie box office revenue is expected to grow in 2017 at more than three times the pace of last year thanks to the success of blockbusters like \"Wolf Warrior 2\", the media regulator said on Friday.\\n\\nAmid South Korea freeze, China says cultural exchanges take the temperature BEIJING Cultural exchanges between countries need to consider the \"temperature\" of popular opinion and how people feel about each other, a senior Chinese official said on Friday, amid a freeze in cultural ties with South Korea over an anti-missile system.\\n\\nSoftBank\\'s big checks are stalling tech IPOs LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.

Is economic growth going to slow slightly? Or maybe global markets are all doomed! Who knows? Two artificial intelligence researchers in Japan say they they\\'re developing a way to predict policy changes from its central bank by watching the split-second changes in facial expression of its chief, Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda usually has a neutral expression and announcements are made in very carefully worded, dry, language after the bank\\'s board decides on a course of action. But the researchers found he displayed fleeting signs of \"anger\" and \"disgust\" at news conferences up to seven weeks before two major policy changes. They say it shows Kuruda sensed existing policies weren\\'t cutting it long before the board acted. And afterwards he displayed less sadness in public appearances. Yoshiyuki Suimon says he wants to study Fed chair Janet Yellen and her European counterpart next.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo\\n\\nBetween April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.\\n\\nThe data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)\\n\\nAmong the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.\\n\\nIn three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.\\n\\nThe data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.\\n\\nReuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.\\n\\nA spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.\\n\\nThe Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.\\n\\nMore than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.\\n\\nUnlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.\\n\\nA surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.\\n\\nCurrent and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.\\n\\nHARDER ON THE POOR\\n\\nCritics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.\\n\\n“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”\\n\\nThe data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.\\n\\nReuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.\\n\\nStudies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.\\n\\nThis makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.\\n\\nIn a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.\\n\\nThe court did not address race in its ruling.\\n\\nAt least six provincial governments in Canada, including those of Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba, have said they are reviewing bail practices. An earlier Reuters investigation found inmates awaiting trial are more likely to die behind bars than their sentenced counterparts.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nPESO ARGENTINO EN PLAZA MARGINAL OPERA EQUILIBRADO A 17,98 UNIDADES POR DÓLAR: OPERADORES\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'plaza\\', \\'operadores\\', \\'millions\\', \\'equilibrado\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'peso\\', \\'opera\\', \\'por\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'marginal\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'unidades\\', \\'dólar\\', \\'turn\\', \\'en\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nMan City striker Aguero ready for Burnley clash, says Guardiola\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'stoke\\', \\'aguero\\', \\'clash\\', \\'city\\', \\'season\\', \\'road\\', \\'manager\\', \\'striker\\', \\'tottenham\\', \\'guardiola\\', \\'sergio\\', \\'ready\\', \\'burnley\\', \\'man\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is ready to face Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, three weeks after breaking a rib in a car crash in Amsterdam, manager Pep Guardiola has said.\\nManchester City\\'s Sergio Aguero on the bench.\\n“For the game against Stoke he (Aguero) had just one training session.\\nHe was fit before Napoli and is ready for tomorrow,” Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.\\nLeague leaders City have netted 17 goals in their last three home matches, including one of the most ruthless attacking displays of the season when they thrashed Stoke City 7-2 last weekend.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is ready to face Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, three weeks after breaking a rib in a car crash in Amsterdam, manager Pep Guardiola has said.\\n\\nManchester City\\'s Sergio Aguero on the bench.

On August 21, Donald Trump announced plans to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. REUTERS/Ahmad Nadeem\\n\\nTrump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.\\n\\nThat was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.\\n\\nSharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.\\n\\n“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”\\n\\nIran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi\\'s foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPeter Apps: The coming robot arms race\\n\\nPaul Wallace: Don\\'t be fooled by Merkel\\'s aura of invincibility\\n\\nPerhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.\\n\\nIntriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.\\n\\nThe catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.\\n\\nTrump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.\\n\\nSixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBigotry seems emboldened : George W.

A $1,000 investment on the day former CEO Jeff Immelt started his tenure would be worth $1,006.38 today. Immelt stepped down Aug. 1.\\n\\nAs proof of GE’s new approach to performance, outgoing CFO Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.\\n\\n“That sense of accountability has to start with me,” he said. “We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me.”\\n\\nGE’s poor financial performance in the third quarter showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE’s highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark “robust dialog,” he said and shedding some of the 18 directors was “being examined.”\\n\\nGE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\\n\\nGE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.\\n\\nGE said weak performance in its power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.\\n\\nGE’s ”solid“ performance in other businesses ”was offset by a decline in power performance in a difficult market,“ Flannery said. Industrial cash flow from operations fell mainly ”because of lower power volume, resulting in lower earnings and higher inventory.”\\n\\nProfit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.\\n\\nCash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.\\n\\nRevenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nSaudi Arabia\\'s IDB plans blockchain-based financial inclusion product\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'shariacompliant\\', \\'idb\\', \\'finance\\', \\'firms\\', \\'inclusion\\', \\'technology\\', \\'products\\', \\'blockchainbased\\', \\'research\\', \\'development\\', \\'saudi\\', \\'tap\\', \\'plans\\', \\'islamic\\', \\'financial\\', \\'product\\', \\'arabias\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - The research arm of the Islamic Development Bank [ISDBA.UL] plans to use blockchain technology to develop sharia-compliant products, aiming to support financial inclusion efforts across its member countries.\\nMohamed Hedi Mejai, director of enterprise development at the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), speaks during a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia March 22, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Faisal Al NasserThe Jeddah-based Islamic Research and Training Institute said it had signed an agreement with local firm Ateon and Belgium-based SettleMint, with the first stage to focus on a technical feasibility study.\\n[nL5N1FE073]Involvement of the IDB, a multilateral development institution, could also encourage other fintech firms to incorporate Islamic finance to tap markets across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.\\nIslamic finance follows religious principles such as a ban on gambling and outright speculation, but until now the sector has focused on traditional retail banking services.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - The research arm of the Islamic Development Bank [ISDBA.UL] plans to use blockchain technology to develop sharia-compliant products, aiming to support financial inclusion efforts across its member countries.\\n\\nMohamed Hedi Mejai, director of enterprise development at the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), speaks during a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia March 22, 2017.

More lending, roaring exports and higher property prices helped push up output by 6.8 percent in the third quarter. For all the talk of innovation, restructuring and deleveraging, the fundamentals driving the world’s second-largest economy have not changed. China still depends on investment more than consumption, manufacturing over services, and cheaper products rather than stronger brands. For better or worse, Beijing looks okay with that.\\n\\nA security agent takes position at the Great Hall of the People during the opening session of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, China October 18, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\\n\\nIn the three months to September, China’s bureaucracy mobilised to do what it does best: produce a rosy backdrop to a big meeting. The statistical result of their efforts landed during the 19th Party Congress, the day after President Xi Jinping trotted out the usual platitudes about territorial integrity and market forces.\\n\\nThose forces certainly have been cooperative. Housing investment, China’s most critical single contributor to demand, remained healthy. Combined with infrastructure spending, it propped up state-owned cement producers, steelmakers and so on. This in turn drove demand for commodities, which pushed up producer prices, benefiting all sorts of other indicators - profitability in state-owned heavy industries, for example.\\n\\nThe private sector isn’t complaining. Trade remains robust. Exports far outstripped imports, suggesting the government’s de-facto import substitution initiative, also known as “Made in China 2025”, is gaining traction. A rally in the yuan has deterred capital outflows without denting exports - another sign that Chinese firms are moving up the value chain.\\n\\nYet there is sparse evidence of a statistically significant move from manufacturing into services. And the country remains highly dependent on debt. It’s true the government has allowed some state-owned firms to default, and suppressed the more dangerous classes of shadow banking. But total credit creation has barely slowed, hitting $274 billion in September.\\n\\nSure, easy liquidity has stimulated sexy entrepreneurship, spawning startups that enable sharing of everything from bicycles to basketballs. But these are macroeconomic blips, and have yet to show that they can earn a return on venture capital.\\n\\nIt’s politically expedient to present tweaks as revolutions.

Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.\\n\\nA protester is escorted away by police at a demonstration outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\\'s constituent office after Senate Republicans unveiled their healthcare bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 22, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\\n\\nAlthough the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.\\n\\nThe current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.\\n\\nFor wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.\\n\\nBusinesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.\\n\\nThe ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.\\n\\nSponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.\\n\\nRather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nTania Karas: At the UN, Trump\\'s silences spoke volumes\\n\\nMaysam Behravesh: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan\\n\\nPaul Wallace: Don\\'t be fooled by Merkel\\'s aura of invincibility\\n\\nIt is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.\\n\\nThe bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.\\n\\n(Samuel R. Bagenstos is the Frank G.

Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.\\n\\nSupporters of far-right party \"Die Rechte\" march in Leipzig, Germany, March 18, 2017. Germany recently passed a new law against hate speech. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\\n\\nOn the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.\\n\\nShould any of these comments \\xad\\xad\\xad− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nDaniel R. DePetris: Trump\\'s \\'business-friendly\\' gun plan will worsen global conflicts\\n\\nBryce Covert: The tax reform that Republicans are missing\\n\\nThe general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\nBut should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”\\n\\nFake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.\\n\\nIn Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the \"defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations\" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?\\n\\nSticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”\\n\\nPut that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.\\n\\nAt a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.\\n\\nWhen I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.\\n\\nIt’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.\\n\\nYet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.\\n\\nLiberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them. Confusingly, these two publics are sometimes one.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nSenate panel postpones hearing with Trump lawyer Cohen in Russia probe\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'committee\\', \\'trumps\\', \\'hearing\\', \\'lawyer\\', \\'russia\\', \\'cohen\\', \\'president\\', \\'attorney\\', \\'donald\\', \\'senate\\', \\'probe\\', \\'intelligence\\', \\'postpones\\', \\'washington\\', \\'panel\\', \\'trump\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Friday it had postponed a public hearing with Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s lawyer, and it would be rescheduled for a later date.\\nMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump\\'s personal attorney, looks on as his attorney (not pictured) delivers a statement to reporters after meeting with Senate Intelligence Committee staff on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 19, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Aaron P.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).\\n\\nThe library of the university KU Leuven \"Katholieke Universiteit Leuven\" is pictured in Leuven, Belgium, June 8, 2016. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\\n\\nREUTERS TOP 100\\n\\nThe most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.\\n\\nHow does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\\n\\nThe second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.\\n\\nOverall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.\\n\\nThe Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.\\n\\nStudents walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\\n\\nAnd the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.\\n\\nSome countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.\\n\\nTo compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.\\n\\nSlideshow (8 Images)\\n\\nThis is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).\\n\\nThe returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.\\n\\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\\n\\nTo see the full methodology, click here.\\n\\n(Editing by Arlyn Gajilan and Alessandra Rafferty)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n标题新闻：瑞典央行料下周维持宽松政策不变，待国内通胀升势企稳和欧洲央行政策决定-路透调查\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'标题新闻瑞典央行料下周维持宽松政策不变待国内通胀升势企稳和欧洲央行政策决定路透调查\\', \\'app\\', \\'quakes\\', \\'massive\\', \\'early\\', \\'technologyafter\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'millions\\', \\'turn\\', \\'warning\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nTechnologyAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nTechnology\\n\\nAfter massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n美国总统特朗普与叶伦会面 考虑FED主席人选提名--白宫官员\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'美国总统特朗普与叶伦会面\\', \\'考虑fed主席人选提名白宫官员\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nMerck to cut 1,800 U.S. sales jobs, add 960 jobs in chronic care\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'united\\', \\'care\\', \\'merck\\', \\'jobs\\', \\'960\\', \\'cut\\', \\'states\\', \\'hepatitis\\', \\'month\\', \\'add\\', \\'sales\\', \\'drugmaker\\', \\'teams\\', \\'chronic\\', \\'1800\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), moving to a new sales team structure in the United States, plans to cut 1,800 sales positions, while adding 960 jobs to a new chronic care sales force, the company said on Friday.\\nREUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration/File PhotoThree of Merck’s U.S. sales teams will be cut, spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said in an emailed statement.\\nThe aim is “to better support changes in our business in the United States,” Gillespie said.\\nEarlier this month, Merck said it would not seek regulatory approval for once-promising cholesterol drug anacetrapib after disappointing trial results.\\nMerck said none of the jobs being eliminated are being moved outside of the United States.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), moving to a new sales team structure in the United States, plans to cut 1,800 sales positions, while adding 960 jobs to a new chronic care sales force, the company said on Friday.\\n\\nThe logo of Merck is pictured in this illustration photograph in Cardiff, California April 26, 2016.

But they\\'re betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.\\n\\nAmericans spend a collective 2.6 billion hours filling in their tax returns. Here taxpayers wait outside the Internal Revenue Service office in Brooklyn after hackers stole the personal data of about 100,000 taxpayers in 2015. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\\n\\nTheir plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.\\n\\nThe Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPeter Van Buren: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider\\'s guide to disaster management\\n\\nPeter Apps: Spain\\'s missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis\\n\\nHowever, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.\\n\\nSimple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.\\n\\nIt’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.\\n\\nIf Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump delivers a speech on tax reform during an event with workers at the Andeavor Refinery in Mandan, North Dakota, September 6, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\\n\\nInstead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.\\n\\nReturn-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.\\n\\nThe concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.\\n\\nBut it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.\\n\\nThat’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.\\n\\nThese companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”\\n\\nSo they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.\\n\\nRepublicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.\\n\\n(Bryce Covert is an independent journalist writing about the economy.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\\n\\nWith the euro zone economic recovery well into its fifth year, the time has come to cut stimulus. Yet, overly ambitious tightening could choke off the very growth Draghi has fostered, threatening to undo years of work.\\n\\nDraghi also has to find common ground between policy hawks, who argue the ECB has spent its firepower so any further stimulus has negligible effect, and doves, who point to persistently weak inflation as evidence the bank has not met its price-stability mandate.\\n\\nThe compromise is likely to be a cut in bond purchases at Thursday’s policy meeting, twinned with a lengthy extension of stimulus and a commitment to keep rates low for many years to come.\\n\\nSuch a move would ensure that easy policy persists while also reducing the ECB’s reliance on unconventional tools and potentially paving the way to exit bond purchases.\\n\\nThe problem is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, unemployment remains high, wage growth is barely visible and inflation will probably not rise back to the ECB’s target before the end of the decade.\\n\\nThe bond purchases have depressed borrowing costs but the ECB is slowly running out of debt to buy so it either takes a step toward the exit or redraws the rules of the program, a potentially controversial move that may send the wrong signal.\\n\\nA Reuters poll of economists concluded the ECB Central Bank it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to 40 billion euros from 60 billion euros in January.\\n\\nIt was mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.\\n\\nSources close to the ECB’s pre-meeting discussions say the a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between 25 and 40 billion euros a month.\\n\\nBut the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.\\n\\nWhile this debate is still open, sources speaking to Reuters said it is more likely the bank would maintain the flexibility and even signal a willingness to increase asset buys if the outlook sours.\\n\\nThat, says UBS, is crucial: “We view the duration of the extension in net asset purchases as more important than the monthly size in ensuring the ECB’s ability to manage the expectations around its future policy.”\\n\\nNew bond purchases will add little to inflation. But they will buy the ECB some time as it waits for growth to finally translate into inflation.\\n\\nIn a glimmer of hope for policymakers, Germany’s largest trade union recently asked for a 6 percent wage hike for nearly 4 million workers, an ambitious move, which could lift wages across the board as many employee groups look to IG Metall to set the trend.\\n\\nEuro zone inflation - currently at 1.5 percent - remains well below the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent and expectations are for it to stay that way at least until 2019.\\n\\nHURRICANES\\n\\nWhile the euro zone enjoys its growth run, the United States, the world’s biggest economy, probably suffered a major hit last quarter, mostly due to the disruptions from hurricanes.\\n\\nAn advance release of third quarter data at the end of the coming week is likely to show growth slowing to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent with a decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\\n\\nRebuilding efforts are, however, expected to boost GDP growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2018, suggesting that the dip is temporary and will be mostly compensated for in the coming quarters.\\n\\n“Damages from the hurricanes will likely total around $150 billion, with an unusually large portion of that coming from business interruption to refineries, petrochemical plants, restaurants and residential construction,” Wells Fargo said, predicting that hurricanes shaved about 0.9 percentage points off Q3 growth.\\n\\nBut economists added that if the weather distortions fade quickly, the U.S. Federal Reserve would remain on course to hike rates before the end of the year, given that the economy is essentially at full employment.\\n\\nA compromise on a tax reform package and a growth rebound could also solidify expectations for two more hikes next year, analysts added.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nShock Tactics, Part 2: As Taser warns of more and more risks, cities...\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'press\\', \\'mac\\', \\'taser\\', \\'codehttpsreutrs2iojjki\\', \\'shock\\', \\'cities\\', \\'ctrlc\\', \\'tactics\\', \\'device\\', \\'windows\\', \\'url\\', \\'copy\\', \\'longpress\\', \\'warns\\', \\'risks\\', \\'mobile\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPress CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the codehttps://reut.rs/2ioJjki\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPress CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code\\n\\nhttps://reut.rs/2ioJjki\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nBreakingviews - ICOs validate old-school \"follow the money\" mantra\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'breakingviews\\', \\'work\\', \\'mantra\\', \\'project\\', \\'tezzies\\', \\'foundation\\', \\'validate\\', \\'raised\\', \\'tezos\\', \\'swiss\\', \\'money\\', \\'icos\\', \\'digital\\', \\'world\\', \\'oldschool\\', \\'right\\', \\'follow\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nHowever, they set up a governance structure in which a legally independent Swiss foundation controls the digital cash raised.\\nNow they are at loggerheads with its president, Johann Gevers, who told Reuters the couple were trying to control the foundation.\\nYet although it seems a sensible step in the experimental world of ICOs to incorporate checks on the use of the funds raised, the Swiss foundation may have been a method too vulnerable to human whims.\\nMeanwhile, China and South Korea have banned ICOs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concerns.\\nRight now, though, an old-fashioned mantra seems to be at work: “follow the money.”\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Call it teething trouble with tezzies. One of the biggest so-called initial coin offerings to date, which raised some $230 million for a blockchain project called Tezos, has led to a spat between its architects and a Swiss foundation that controls the digital cash, according to a Reuters special report. Even in the world of crypto-currencies, traditional financial motivations apply.\\n\\nPhoto illustration shows detail of Tezos website, October 10, 2017. Picture taken October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\\n\\nICOs, a hot financial trend with well over $2 billion raised this year, fall somewhere on the spectrum between crowd-funding and issuing non-voting shares. Participants contribute existing digital currencies like bitcoin and ether. Some may simply want to bankroll the project in question, but most hope to grab a slug of whatever new online coinage is on offer – in the Tezos case, “tezzies” – and to see it appreciate, as ether has done nearly 40-fold this year alone.\\n\\nThe creators of Tezos, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, got the fund-raising formula right. However, they set up a governance structure in which a legally independent Swiss foundation controls the digital cash raised. Now they are at loggerheads with its president, Johann Gevers, who told Reuters the couple were trying to control the foundation. They have accused him of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.”\\n\\nThe Breitmans stand to collect a portion of the proceeds – now in theory worth roughly double their original value – as Tezos project milestones trigger the foundation’s purchase of their company, Dynamic Ledger Solutions. Yet although it seems a sensible step in the experimental world of ICOs to incorporate checks on the use of the funds raised, the Swiss foundation may have been a method too vulnerable to human whims.\\n\\nMeanwhile, China and South Korea have banned ICOs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concerns. Project details can be very sketchy and it’s not always clear what contributors are entitled to receive. Kathleen Breitman likens the Tezos fundraising to making a donation and receiving a tote bag in return, but people interviewed by Reuters seem more like investors who are expecting returns.\\n\\nThe backstory is intriguing. The Breitmans met at a crypto-anarchist lunch. He, the son of a French playwright and actor, went on to work at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, while she later toiled at Ray Dalio’s secretive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. An early backer was Silicon Valley doyen Tim Draper. Right now, though, an old-fashioned mantra seems to be at work: “follow the money.”\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nEU prüft Dumping-Vorwürfe gegen E-Bike-Hersteller aus China\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'gobeebike\\', \\'gegen\\', \\'china\\', \\'ebikehersteller\\', \\'citys\\', \\'reutersbobby\\', \\'kong\\', \\'yip\\', \\'aus\\', \\'road\\', \\'prüft\\', \\'hong\\', \\'dumpingvorwürfe\\', \\'eu\\', \\'service\\', \\'left\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nA \"Gobee.bike\" bicycle, the city\\'s first bike-sharing service, is left on a road side in Hong Kong, China August 29, 2017.\\nREUTERS/Bobby Yip\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nA \"Gobee.bike\" bicycle, the city\\'s first bike-sharing service, is left on a road side in Hong Kong, China August 29, 2017.

But while money will unite leaders at this week’s European summit, it will divide them after Brexit.\\n\\nDemonstrators wave flags ahead of a speech by Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May in Florence, Italy September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Max Rossi\\n\\nThe British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.\\n\\nPolitical discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.\\n\\nThe EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nPeter Apps: China\\'s \\'Big Brother\\' tech gives surveillance new reach\\n\\nJohn Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy\\n\\nIf economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.\\n\\nBut that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.\\n\\nWhat this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).\\n\\nOn top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.\\n\\nAlthough money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.\\n\\nThe British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.\\n\\nThe EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.\\n\\nBoth Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill. But once Britain leaves, the bickering over money will begin – and the push toward a stronger union could be tougher than ever to achieve.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nПутин назвал конкурентность России задачей на следующий срок президента\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'президента\\', \\'на\\', \\'назвал\\', \\'путин\\', \\'vetting\\', \\'intensify\\', \\'politicsus\\', \\'children\\', \\'задачей\\', \\'срок\\', \\'следующий\\', \\'refugees\\', \\'конкурентность\\', \\'women\\', \\'россии\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPoliticsU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPolitics\\n\\nU.S. may intensify vetting of women, children refugees\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nPakistan spinner Hafeez reported over bowling action\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'period\\', \\'pakistan\\', \\'reported\\', \\'spinner\\', \\'cricket\\', \\'illegal\\', \\'icc\\', \\'pakistans\\', \\'action\\', \\'international\\', \\'bowling\\', \\'hafeez\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\n(Reuters) -

This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.\\n\\n“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.\\n\\nAdding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.\\n\\nThose closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.\\n\\nTo whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.\\n\\n“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Employees close a valve of a pipe at a PetroChina refinery in Lanzhou, Gansu province January 7, 2011.

California wildfires have killed at least 23 people and destroyed 3,500 homes or businesses. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart\\n\\nIn August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.\\n\\nThe toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.\\n\\nMORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY\\n\\nSeyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran\\n\\nFollowing a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.\\n\\nThe issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”\\n\\nWhile heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.\\n\\nJust like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.\\n\\nCurrently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.\\n\\nStricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.\\n\\nWildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.\\n\\nLow-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”\\n\\nThe West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.\\n\\nThe forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nLe flou demeure sur le financement du service national\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'financement\\', \\'à\\', \\'le\\', \\'et\\', \\'les\\', \\'demeure\\', \\'national\\', \\'des\\', \\'du\\', \\'flou\\', \\'qui\\', \\'une\\', \\'la\\', \\'service\\', \\'sur\\', \\'en\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nPARIS (Reuters) - Le service national universel, dont les modalités et le financement restent à déterminer, devrait disposer d‘un budget spécifique dans le projet de loi de finances 2019, année de son expérimentation, a déclaré vendredi Geneviève Darrieussecq, qui juge “fantaisistes” les hypothèses budgétaires actuelles.\\nLe service national universel, dont les modalités et le financement restent à déterminer, devrait disposer d\\'un budget spécifique dans le projet de loi de finances 2019, année de son expérimentation, a déclaré vendredi Geneviève Darrieussecq, qui juge \"fantaisistes\" les hypothèses budgétaires actuelles.\\nLe gouvernement a d‘ores et déjà assuré que son financement ne pèserait pas sur le budget de la Défense, déjà sous tension, mais ne dit rien de son coût potentiel.\\nLe SNU devra en outre s‘articuler avec le service militaire volontaire (SMV) voulu par François Hollande à la suite des attentats de janvier 2015 pour les jeunes de 18 à 25 ans.\\n“Il faudra que les jeunes sortent du SNU en sachant ce qu‘est l‘engagement”, a-t-elle souligné.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nPARIS (Reuters) - Le service national universel, dont les modalités et le financement restent à déterminer, devrait disposer d‘un budget spécifique dans le projet de loi de finances 2019, année de son expérimentation, a déclaré vendredi Geneviève Darrieussecq, qui juge “fantaisistes” les hypothèses budgétaires actuelles.\\n\\nLe service national universel, dont les modalités et le financement restent à déterminer, devrait disposer d\\'un budget spécifique dans le projet de loi de finances 2019, année de son expérimentation, a déclaré vendredi Geneviève Darrieussecq, qui juge \"fantaisistes\" les hypothèses budgétaires actuelles. /Photo prise le 22 juin 2017/REUTERS/Charles Platiau\\n\\nPromesse de campagne d‘Emmanuel Macron, ce “creuset national” serait dédié, selon le voeu du chef de l‘Etat, aux filles et garçons de 18 à 21 ans sur une période d‘un mois, soit 600.000 à 800.000 jeunes d‘une classe d‘âge.\\n\\nUne mission d‘évaluation des divers dispositifs existants pour la jeunesse s‘achève sous l‘égide des services du Premier ministre avant de laisser place à une commission qui sera nommée début novembre pour formuler au printemps 2018 des propositions sur le SNU dont le flou interroge dans les rangs des armées.\\n\\nLe gouvernement a d‘ores et déjà assuré que son financement ne pèserait pas sur le budget de la Défense, déjà sous tension, mais ne dit rien de son coût potentiel.\\n\\n“Le chef de l‘Etat s‘est engagé à ce qu‘il y ait une ligne budgétaire bien identifiée.

Öffnung für ausländische Investoren, Abbau von Kreditrisiken, Umbau der Industrie: China will mit einer Reihe von Reformen das Wachstum seiner Wirtschaft sichern. Diese zeigt sich derzeit in guter Form. Trotz einer minimalen Abkühlung in den Sommermonaten dürfte sich der Aufschwung in der nach den USA zweitgrößten Volkswirtschaft der Welt 2017 verstärken - zum ersten Mal seit sieben Jahren.\\n\\nChina\\'s central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan speaks during a session on the second day of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\\n\\n“Wir werden ausländischen Banken mehr Raum geben”, kündigte der Chef der Bankenaufsicht Guo Shuqing, auf dem Parteinkongress an. Der Marktanteil ausländischer Banken in der Volksrepublik habe sich in den vergangenen zehn Jahren auf 1,2 Prozent halbiert. “Das ist kein Vorteil für den Wettbewerb und Strukturverbesserungen”, sagte Guo. Er signalisierte zudem, die Regeln für den Abbau fauler Kredite zu verschärfen. Finanzrisiken müssten ebenso eingedämmt werden wie ein Anstieg versteckter Schulden. Die Verschuldung, die etwa 258 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes ausmacht, gilt als eines der größten Konjunkturrisiken. Die Rating-Agentur S&P stufte erst im September die Kreditwürdigkeit des Landes herab, da “eine längere Phase des starken Kreditwachstums die ökonomischen und finanziellen Risiken Chinas erhöht hat”.\\n\\nDie Zentralbank ist sich des Problems bewusst. Ihr Chef Zhou Xiaochuan warnte am Rande des Kongresses vor einem “Minsky Moment”. Er spielte damit auf eine nach dem amerikanischen Ökonom Hyman Minsky benannte Theorie an, wonach trotz boomender Wirtschaft eine plötzliche Krise auftreten kann. “Wir sollten uns darauf konzentrieren, dramatischen Anpassungen vorzubeugen”, sagte Zhou mit Blick auf die hohe Verschuldung der Unternehmen und steigender Verbraucherkredite.\\n\\nDie Regierung geht bereits gegen eine drohende Immobilienpreisblase vor, was derzeit den Aufschwung leicht dämpft. Das Bruttoinlandsprodukt stieg im dritten Quartal um 6,8 Prozent zum Vorjahreszeitraum. Im ersten Halbjahr hatte es noch zu 6,9 Prozent gereicht. Trotz des etwas verlangsamten Tempos dürfte das von der Regierung vorgegebene Ziel von rund 6,5 Prozent für das Gesamtjahr übertroffen werden. Die Konjunktur sei stabil, sagte der Sprecher des Statistikamtes Xing Zhihong. 2016 hatte es mit 6,7 Prozent das kleinste Plus seit 26 Jahren gegeben. Dieser Wert dürfte in diesem Jahr übertroffen werden, erwarten Experten nach den ersten drei Quartalen.\\n\\nBremsspuren hinterließ in den Sommermonaten der Bausektor. Die Zahl der Neubauten nahm nicht mehr so stark zu, während der Verkauf von Bestandsimmobilien im September sogar erstmals seit mehr als zweieinhalb Jahren sank. “Der Immobilienboom hat zweifellos seinen Höhepunkt überschritten”, sagte Analystin Rosealea Yao vom Beratungsunternehmen Gavekal Dragonomics. Um Überhitzungen vorzubeugen, hat die Regierung beispielsweise die Vergabe risikoreicher Kredite erschwert.\\n\\nGestützt wird der Aufschwung vom Außenhandel und der Industrie, die von der besseren Weltkonjunktur profitiert. Die Firmen stellten im September 6,6 Prozent mehr her als vor Jahresfrist. Das ist mehr als Experten für möglich gehalten hatten. Sie bereiten sich damit auch auf den Winter vor, in dem die Regierung immer wieder im Kampf gegen die Luftverschmutzung Fabriken stilllegt. Der Einzelhandel schaffte im September ein überraschend kräftiges Umsatzplus von 10,3 Prozent.\\n\\n“Derzeit braucht man sich um das chinesische Wachstum nicht zu sorgen”, sagte der Chefvolkswirt der VP Bank, Thomas Gitzel. “Auch in den kommenden Quartalen dürfte die Volkswirtschaft in ähnlicher Größenordnung zulegen, dafür wird alleine schon die Regierung sorgen.” Präsident Xi Jinping kündigte auf dem Parteikongress eine Öffnung des Dienstleistungssektors sowie eine Reform des Devisen- und Finanzsystems an. Bis 2035 solle China eines der innovativsten Länder der Welt werden, das seine Umweltprobleme grundlegend gelöst habe. In der Binnenwirtschaft will Xi den privaten Konsum als Grundlage für die weitere Entwicklung ankurbeln. Fortgesetzt werde der Kampf gegen Überkapazitäten in der Industrie.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nCar bomb explodes on outskirts of Somali capital, killing driver: police\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'capital\\', \\'village\\', \\'explodes\\', \\'driver\\', \\'told\\', \\'truck\\', \\'nur\\', \\'car\\', \\'saidthe\\', \\'mogadishu\\', \\'killing\\', \\'bomb\\', \\'outskirts\\', \\'somali\\', \\'northwest\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nMOGADISHU (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded on the outskirts of the Somali capital Mogadishu on Friday killing the driver, police said.\\nThe car detonated in the village of Markaz just over 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Mogadishu, Major Nur Ali told Reuters.\\nMore than 300 people were killed on Saturday in the capital’s deadliest truck bombing.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nMOGADISHU (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded on the outskirts of the Somali capital Mogadishu on Friday killing the driver, police said.\\n\\nThe car detonated in the village of Markaz just over 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Mogadishu, Major Nur Ali told Reuters.

On Friday, a spokesman for the deputy president said: “We are aware of the speculation, but it is just speculation.”\\n\\nTrade union federation Cosatu and the South African Communist Party (SACP), both partners in the ANC’s ruling alliance, have endorsed Ramaphosa, 64, for the leadership.\\n\\nSouth Africa will elect a new president in 2019, and whoever the ANC picks in December is likely to take over from 75-year-old Zuma as the country’s leader.\\n\\nZuma is under pressure to step down before then, with a recent South African court ruling that nearly 800 corruption charges against him should be reinstated prompting more calls for the president to go.\\n\\nZuma reshuffled his cabinet for the second time in seven months on Tuesday, irking some within the ruling alliance by sacking a minister belonging to the SACP and appointing a close ally to oversee an opaque nuclear deal.\\n\\nAnalysts say Zuma may make further changes before December to strengthen his hand going into the ANC’s elective conference.\\n\\nSpeculation that he might remove Ramaphosa, who was the ANC’s chief negotiator during the 1990s transition from apartheid, weighed on the rand and bonds, which underperformed emerging market peers on Friday versus a firmer dollar.\\n\\n“Other emerging markets are weaker but not as much as the rand. That’s because of lingering political uncertainty, especially these rumors about Zuma axing Ramaphosa,” said currency dealer at TreasuryOne Wichard Cilliers.\\n\\nRamaphosa told parliament on Thursday that “if (Zuma‘s) decision is to remove me, I will accept that as a decision that will be taken by the president and I will continue serving the people of South Africa in one form, shape or another”.\\n\\nSTATE CAPTURE\\n\\nSpeaking on Friday, Ramaphosa returned to the subject of corruption within the government and state-owned companies, which is expected to be a main theme of his leadership campaign.\\n\\n“Our state has been captured by people who ... want to milk the state, who want to rob our country of the money that belongs to the people,” Ramaphosa told members of the National Education Health & Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in Cape Town.\\n\\n“Our state is now being talked about in the rest of the world in the most negative terms, captured by certain interests, by certain families, by certain individuals.”\\n\\nWealthy friends of Zuma, the Guptas, have been accused by ANC and opposition politicians of using their close relationship with the president and his allies to influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nZuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing and the Indian-born South African businessmen and their companies have not been charged with any crime in South Africa.\\n\\nRegulators in the United States and Britain are looking into links between the Gupta family, the South African government, and banks they may have used to move money as a corruption investigation escalates.\\n\\nIn a statement on Friday, Dlamini-Zuma denied she had any links to the Gupta family.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\nImage of the United States has plunged under Trump, survey shows\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'united\\', \\'trump\\', \\'countries\\', \\'ratings\\', \\'president\\', \\'states\\', \\'showed\\', \\'plunged\\', \\'image\\', \\'confidence\\', \\'mexico\\', \\'survey\\', \\'shows\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nJust 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era.\\n“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said.\\nThe countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent.\\nOn the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general.\\nAnd in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nBERLIN (Reuters) - The image of the United States has deteriorated sharply across the globe under President Donald Trump and an overwhelming majority of people in other countries have no confidence in his ability to lead, a survey from the Pew Research Center showed.\\n\\nFive months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.\\n\\nBut the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.\\n\\nTrump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.\\n\\nOn his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.\\n\\nJust 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era.

Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.\\n\\n“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: From L-R, European Council President Donald Tusk, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe react during a family photo during the G7 Summit in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, May 26, 2017.

Is economic growth going to slow slightly? Or maybe global markets are all doomed! Who knows? Two artificial intelligence researchers in Japan say they they\\'re developing a way to predict policy changes from its central bank by watching the split-second changes in facial expression of its chief, Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda usually has a neutral expression and announcements are made in very carefully worded, dry, language after the bank\\'s board decides on a course of action. But the researchers found he displayed fleeting signs of \"anger\" and \"disgust\" at news conferences up to seven weeks before two major policy changes. They say it shows Kuruda sensed existing policies weren\\'t cutting it long before the board acted. And afterwards he displayed less sadness in public appearances. Yoshiyuki Suimon says he wants to study Fed chair Janet Yellen and her European counterpart next.

The bill passing Thursday night after Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was able to scrap together a majority. Now the real debate begins. President Trump and Republican leaders are hoping to simplify the tax code by lowering rates and removing popular carve outs. But they\\'re already at odds over whether wealthy families should get a tax cut and whether popular tax breaks should be preserved. And there are budget hawks like Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee who say they\\'ll refuse to vote for any tax plan that would increase the national debt. The White House and Republican leaders saying that tax cuts will pay for themselves through faster economic growth - but independent tax experts saying that\\'s not likely. The debate is certain to heat up as interest groups of all stripes mobilize to protect their perks.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-Title- \\n\"Anemic\" iPhone 8 demand drags Apple lower\\n-Keywords-\\n[\\'pullback\\', \\'drags\\', \\'group\\', \\'apple\\', \\'really\\', \\'michael\\', \\'lower\\', \\'iphone\\', \\'anemic\\', \\'bapis\\', \\'number\\', \\'demand\\', \\'hightower\\']\\n-SUMMARY ARTICLE-\\nSigns of poor demand for the iPhone 8 sent Apple\\'s stock lower on Thursday.\\nMichael Bapis of Bapis Group at HighTower: (SOUNDBITE) MICHAEL BAPIS, PARTNER, BAPIS GROUP AT HIGHTOWER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"You might see a pullback in Apple.\\nThe only thing that would cause Apple to really get hammered is if the glitches don\\'t get fixed.\\nIf the demand for the iPhone 8 really does slow down a lot more than people are anticipating.\\nApple released iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in September.\\n-TEXT INSIDE ARTICLE-\\nSigns of poor demand for the iPhone 8 sent Apple\\'s stock lower on Thursday.

A newspaper in Taiwan reported Apple has cut production orders on iPhone 8 by more than 50 percent for the rest of the year. A number of sector analysts played down the concerns. Michael Bapis of Bapis Group at HighTower: (SOUNDBITE) MICHAEL BAPIS, PARTNER, BAPIS GROUP AT HIGHTOWER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"You might see a pullback in Apple. I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be long term. The only thing that would cause Apple to really get hammered is if the glitches don\\'t get fixed. If the demand for the iPhone 8 really does slow down a lot more than people are anticipating. I know there was a glitch with the software updates and, most likely, they\\'ll figure it out.
